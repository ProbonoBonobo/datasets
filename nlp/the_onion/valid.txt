Hungover Coworker A Little Too Functional Morning After Holiday Party Not To Be Alcoholic
KANSAS CITY, MO — Prancing into the office like he didn't just drink eight beers and something called the "Santa's special" the very night before, sources confirmed Friday that their hungover coworker Justin Davis was a little too functional the morning after their company's holiday party not to be an alcoholic. "Just eight hours ago, I saw Justin slam a couple shots of tequila, and now, he's showing up to work almost an hour early with donuts for everyone," said officemate Alyssa Woolas, adding that Justin, who had visibly bloodshot eyes, a low, raspy voice, and no memory of how he got home last night, was somehow just as productive now as he was on a normal workday. "Look. I love Justin, and I had a really fun time drinking with him, but I woke up with a pounding headache, still wearing my clothes from the night before. For him to go to bed at 3 a.m., wake up at 7 a.m., and then take the stairs up to our sixth-floor office must mean this is a little too much of a regular thing." At press time, office sources told reporters that after nearly 12 straight hours of partying, the reason Justin was so chipper was because he was still drunk.

College Freshman Annoyed About Having To Room With 47-Year-Old Adjunct Professor
AUGUSTA, ME — Expressing frustration with his roommate's apparent lack of hygiene and off-putting habits, college freshman Kyle Hayes told reporters Tuesday that he was annoyed about having to room with Isaac Feldman, a 47-year-old adjunct professor at the University of Maine. "He's always hitting me up for money and meal swipes, but my plan doesn't really cover that," said Hayes, adding that his roommate also tended to do these "weird exercises" in their living area to help with the back problem he developed in his early 40s. "Anytime I try to have people over, Isaac is always on my case about quieting down because he needs to stay up late grading papers about Heidegger or something. But he seems to have no problem covering his desk with empty ramen containers and pages from his doctoral thesis. Plus, he's definitely been drinking my milk. I tried to talk to him about not going into my mini-fridge, but he's always rushing out the door to pick up his daughter from his ex's. Man, this whole situation sucks." Hayes went on to stress that he would probably ask to switch to a different dorm if his roommate kept insisting that he be referred to as Dr. Feldman in conversation.

Catholic Priest Stuck In Remote Backwater Town Thinking About Molesting Kid Just To Get Transferred
YELLOW SPRINGS, OH — In an attempt to extricate himself from the moribund lifestyle of his rural town, Catholic priest Father James Callahan found himself seriously considering child molestation this week as a possible avenue of being transferred to a different parish. "There's just nothing interesting going on here, and while I'd welcome the chance to relocate, I don't want to wait the usual five years, so I figure I'll be accused of something with an altar boy and be packing my bags in no time," said Callahan, who normally has no sexual predilections towards children, but after submitting several fruitless requests for transfer, decided on what he believed was the quickest way to get himself placed in a more sophisticated, urban environment. "The nearest city to here is Dayton and that's still half an hour away, so I'm kind of going up the walls here. I'd love to end up somewhere where you can get decent sushi, but honestly, even going someplace warm for the winter would be worth being involved with a congregant's child." Callahan later elaborated that if he eventually got bored at the new parish, he could most likely keep on molesting kids until he was posted to a sweet gig in Rome.

Newly Pregnant Woman A Little Too Quick To Remind Everyone She Gets To Have One Glass Of Wine A Week
CORPUS CHRISTI, TX — Confirming no one had raised the subject of drinking, coworkers of newly expectant mother Jennifer Guest reported that after the brand consultant announced her pregnancy to the office Monday, she had been a bit too quick to mention she was still allowed to have a weekly glass of wine. "She had barely gotten out that she was having a baby before she was, like, 'I can still have wine, though!' " said Bridgemeyer Marketing Services secretary Sharon Wilson, recalling how Guest had reiterated several times that it was a normal thing to do while pregnant and had gotten progressively more defensive despite the fact that no one was disagreeing with her. "Before we could even congratulate her, she was going into detail about how it was a great way for pregnant women to wind down at the end of the week, and that it wasn't like a drink or even two was going to hurt the baby. It got uncomfortable at one point, because she started citing a bunch of studies, complete with all these complicated statistics, and everyone was just kind of nodding in silence. Thankfully, [operations manager] Frank [Searle] said he had read somewhere that red wine was good for your heart, and that took the heat off her for a while." At press time, attendees at a company happy hour said that while Guest had ordered only one 6-ounce glass of chardonnay that evening, she had been a little too wholehearted in her enjoyment of it.

Queen Reminds Worker Bees They Still Represent Colony Even When Away From Hive
ALBUQUERQUE, NM — In an effort to ensure they maintained a degree of professionalism and decorum during their travels, a queen bee sternly reminded her workers Monday that they still represented the colony even when they were away from the hive. "I want you to have a good time out there collecting pollen, but keep in mind that you are all acting as ambassadors for our nest, so make sure you're on your best behavior," said the queen bee, urging the assembled swarm to bring the same common sense and good judgment they'd use amongst the honeycombs to any fruit or flower they encountered during their trip. "Remember, when you've been out there downing nectar all morning and you decide it might be funny to crawl along someone's Coke can or sting a kid in the face, it doesn't just reflect poorly on you, it reflects on the hive as a whole and on my ability as a sexually mature female bee. So, don't do anything to embarrass me — I'm looking at you particularly, HBW/B433-481-K7." The queen added that while she didn't want to scare them, a lifestyle of engaging in immoral and unbecoming behavior could lead to colony collapse disorder.

Man Wastes Entire Life Chasing Unrealistic Pipe Dream Of Being Loved And Respected
AURORA, IL — Lamenting at how naive he was to believe such a thing was actually possible, 73-year-old Illinois resident Johnny Krissel told reporters Monday that he regretted wasting his entire life chasing an unrealistic pipe dream of being loved and respected. "Ever since I was a little boy, I've had this crazy, pie-in-the-sky idea that I could one day be valued and admired by those around me, but now look at me," said a downtrodden Krissel, who after a long sigh, added that pursuing happiness and self-worth ended up being nothing more than a crazy fantasy. "Sure, it was insane, but I thought if I worked hard and dedicated myself, I could make myself someone that people actually enjoyed being around. But I guess my friends and family were right. I should have just stuck to being a reviled piece of shit in my hometown like everyone else instead of pissing away my twenties and thirties. Why did I even try?" At press time, a dejected Krissel told reporters he hoped his story could one day serve as a cautionary tale to young people hoping to lead a meaningful life full of emotional satisfaction.

Mother Confident That Adult Son's Cycle Of Emotional Terrorism Will Calm Down Once He Finds The Right Girl
HOUSTON — Writing off the behavior as common for his age, local mother Deenah Young told sources Thursday she was confident her 26-year-old son Devin's psychological abuse of all the women he had ever dated was simply a phase that would end when he met the right girl. "I know it's a little silly for Dev to still be leveraging sociopathic levels of misogyny toward every member of the female gender, but he's just waiting for that special someone," said Young, who expressed complete assurance that once he really fell in love, her son would cease the decades-long pattern in which he has engaged in the emotional manipulation, vicious ridicule, and ultimate abandonment of every woman he has dated. "Sometimes the right one has to come along before a boy will stop barraging girlfriends with constant comments about their weight, or hang up those youthful desires to isolate a woman from her friends and family in order to take advantage of her. Devin's having his fun, but mark my words, before he hits 30, he'll get tired and settle down. Then he won't spend all his time maliciously destroying his partner's confidence just to prop up his own anymore. And who knows? Maybe there's a girl out there who will find his constant oscillation between manipulative isolation and suffocating neediness endearing." Reports later confirmed Young couldn't help but chuckle and shake her head at her son's hijinks after hearing yet another girlfriend had filed a restraining order against him.

Man Asks Every Trick-Or-Treater If They're The Real Dracula Just In Case
CLIFTON, NJ — Saying he was unwilling to take any chances with his safety, local man Jay Tierney confirmed Thursday that he made sure to ask every trick-or-treater if they're the real Dracula, just in case. "Obviously, Halloween can be a lot of fun, but if you show up at my doorstep with fangs and a cape, I'm gonna need some answers in case I need to defend myself," said Tierney, adding that, as a precaution, he kept a wooden stake and mallet behind the front door. "Usually, they say 'No' and I can just play it off like a joke, but better safe than sorry. I don't want to end up a vampire myself, cursed to walk the night and feast on the blood of the innocent just because I was too embarrassed to ask a simple question. If a trick-or-treater ever does admit he's Dracula, I'll probably throw a Snickers in the yard and then lock the door while he's picking it up." At press time, Tierny peeked from behind a curtain as several costumed teens, among them possibly a real zombie and the actual Darth Vader, egged his house.

Girlfriend Must Have Been Drinking When She Texted Picture Of Knitted Scarf At Midnight
REDONDO BEACH, CA — Insisting that the rapid-fire series of messages was "completely unprompted," local man Matisse Issac speculated Thursday that his girlfriend, Rebecca Allen, must have been drinking when she texted him a dimly lit picture of a knitted scarf at midnight. "Jesus Christ, now she's telling me to come over and knit with her. I have work in the morning," said Issac, who nervously texted back "nice" in response to the garter-knit scarf in a desperate attempt to buy time to think of a proper response. "I can already see what happened here. She had a glass and a half of wine and just started knitting. She gets a little flirty when she's drunk, and it's not like I'm mad or anything, but I really don't know what to say." At press time, Ms. Allen had texted her boyfriend a winking face emoji to accompany the message "What are you reading right now?"

Washboard Player In Jug Band Tired Of Spoons Guy Getting All The Chicks
MEMPHIS, TN — Revealing elevated tensions in the group, washboard player Jimmy Phelps confirmed Tuesday that he was tired of his jug band's spoons guy getting all the chicks. "I do a lot of leg work setting the tone for the whole show, yet the ladies are all over that jackass," said Phelps, watching with envy as female fans rushed to get photos and autographs from the self-confident spoons player. "What an arrogant prick walking up on stage in his flashy overalls and straw hat and showboating like that. I mean, obviously, the jug guy is going to get some attention because he's the leader, but the spoons guy? Really? They're a dime a dozen. It's actually really hard to find a quality washboard player these days. Besides, I joined Colonel Pillbox's Jug Band & Company way before he did, so it's only fair I get some acknowledgment." At press time, Phelps decided to drown his loneliness and heartache in bathtub gin.

Man Can't Look At Angel Flying Down From Heaven To Save Drowning Child And Not Feel Like There Must Be Some Higher Power Out There
SAINT IGNACE, MI — As a divine chorus pealed forth in joy and triumph from the sky above the lake, contractor Charles Taylor admitted that he could never behold the sight of an angel flying down from Heaven to save a drowning little boy without experiencing the almost overwhelming feeling that there must be some sort of higher power at work in the universe. "I'm normally what you might call a skeptical man, but when I witness the sky open in a burst of healing white radiance in which I behold the countenance of an undeniably divine celestial being, I can't help but wonder if there may be something bigger than all of us," said Taylor, evidently lost in thought at the possibility of a great design at work in the universe as an unutterably beautiful angel descended upon wings of the purest light to lift a flailing, half-conscious child into its luminous embrace. "I don't know…maybe I'm just seeing what I want to see in this ethereal winged creature. But there are moments in life; small, still moments of reflection, like a baby laughing, or a smile from a stranger, or maybe that angel clad in numinous glory over there, the one who just restored a child to life and delivered it from watery oblivion to solid ground. It's enough to make me think that just maybe there's something more than just this little life of ours." Taylor reportedly left the scene before he could comment on the angel's decision to smite over three dozen souls from the lake with a flaming sword for the sins of sodomy, usury, and failing to observe the Sabbath.

Report: It Going To Take A Lot More Than 'Love Shack' To Bring Wedding Guest Out To Dance Floor
CARMEL, IN — In a report that shed new light into "How to really get this party going," wedding guest Melissa Ramirez confirmed Friday that it was going to take a lot more than "Love Shack" to bring her out to the dance floor. "If you think dropping a silly little song like 'Love Shack' is going to make people leap out of their seats, then you've got another thing coming," said Ramirez, who noted that the DJ was going to have to bring his A game if he thought middling tracks like "We Are Family" or "Tainted Love" would cut it. "It's got to be faster. It's got to be louder. And it's got to be something choreographed. Look at these poor people now, they can't dance to this. They're just kind of standing there shimmying. I'm not getting out there for anything less than the 'Cha-Cha Slide.'" At press time, Ramirez was shaking her head as her entire table jumped to their feet upon hearing the opening bars of "I Want You Back."

'Just Be Honest If This Looks Good,' Girlfriend Wearing New Big Bird Outfit Asks Panicking Boyfriend
YOUNGSTOWN, OH — Looking for honest feedback on the latest addition to her wardrobe, local 27-year-old Molly Hanson reportedly asked her panicking boyfriend "Does this look good?" while wearing a new Big Bird outfit. "I spent a little more than I usually do, but I really think it compliments my figure," said Hanson, as she spun around for her stammering, sweat-covered boyfriend of six months, giving him a full view of the bright yellow plumage, ribbed pink-and-orange leggings, and 8-inch beak she had purchased earlier that afternoon. "Does it look flattering? I haven't taken the tag off yet, so if you totally hate it, I can still return it and get my $200 back. The important thing is that you like it." At press time, after 15 minutes of stumbling over his words, Hanson's boyfriend admitted the outfit went great with her eyes despite his disappointment that it wasn't Oscar the Grouch.

Music Buff Pissed 'Come Josephine In My Flying Machine' Left Off Pitchfork's 'Best Of The 1910s' List
PITTSBURGH — Decrying the omission as a blatant attempt to stir up controversy, music buff Miles Sherman told reporters Friday that he was pissed to see Blanche Ring's "Come Josephine In My Flying Machine" left off Pitchfork's "Best of the 1910s" decade-ending list. "This is such typical Pitchfork horseshit — you're seriously telling me the greatest song by Blanche Ring doesn't even land a mention on their rankings?" said Sherman, shaking his head in disbelief as he noted that you couldn't take a step in the early 20th century without hearing Victrolas playing Ring's distinctive soprano as she sang about an aviator taking his dearest gal to the moon in a flying contraption. "Oh, I'm sorry that Blanche goddamn Ring, the queen of the vaudeville circuit, doesn't meet your oh-so-precious standards for great music. Meanwhile, they're putting crowd-pleasing crap like 'Play That Barber-Shop Chord' and 'Turn Your Light Off Mister Moon Man' in the top 10. It's like, are you fucking kidding me? Jack Norworth? Christ, I had to double-check the page just to make sure I wasn't losing my mind." At press time, a visibly exasperated Sherman was questioning whether any of the writers who compiled the list were even alive in 1913 to see the true impact of Ring's "Yip-I-Addy-I-Ay".

Your Horoscopes — Week Of February 11, 2020
Your charred, lifeless body will time and again debunk the old myth about lightning never striking the same place twice. Your mother claims that she never raised a liar for a son, but then what else do you expect from a lizard-human hybrid born out of a top-secret government project? Fun and despair will be in the air this week when a nearby confetti factory explodes, killing 63 employees. You've never been good at saying goodbye, which explains why your speech therapist keeps charging you for an extra half hour each week. The stakes will be raised this Thursday, moments before being repeatedly plunged by frightened townspeople into your chest. You'll soon stumble upon the secret to a happy marriage — a secret so simple you'll take perverse pleasure in keeping it from your wife. There's a time and a place for everything, as you'll soon discover after falling into the rhinoceros pit during mating season. Your first instinct this week will be to run, while your second instinct this week will be to find your legs. The sudden rise in mood swings, wild food cravings, and rapid head-to-toe hair growth can only mean one thing: It's that time of the lunar cycle again! Your entire life will flash before your eyes this week, an insignificant blip made all the more trivial by the Benny Hill theme that will accompany it. While you may have valor, resolve, and even vigor, what you don't have is a basic understanding of what those words actually mean. After days of grave and anxious discussion, the stars have decided that it's better you don't know.

CNN Moderator Desk Crowded After 16 Pundits Qualify For Debate
WESTERVILLE, OH — Jockeying to have their questions heard over the other anchors and journalists crowded around the table's microphones, 16 pundits reportedly crowded the CNN moderator desk Tuesday night after qualifying for the fourth democratic debate. "Mr. Sanders, what do you say to concerns about your health after — Excuse me, Mr. Cooper, let me finish my question," said Chris Cuomo, raising his voice and elbowing his way towards the microphone to cut off Fareed Zakaria, Erin Burnett, Brooke Baldwin, and nearly a dozen other CNN news hosts and interviewers who secured a seat at the densely packed table by polling above 2% among cable viewers. "Sir! Sir! Let me just ask the former vice president one last thing about his son's dealings with Burisma. I've earned my place at this desk tonight, and I can't help but wonder why Don Lemon is getting the lion's share of the time to address the candidates. Why not allow the American people to decide which of our moderation styles they prefer?" At press time, all 16 moderators had shifted into their closing question and were speaking in unison to ask exactly how the candidates would pay for their ambitious proposals without raising taxes on the middle class.

CNN Figures It Can Soak Tom Steyer For Couple Million By Pretending It Costs Money To Appear In Debate
DES MOINES, IA — Speculating that the candidate would not raise an objection to any sum they named, CNN officials reported Tuesday that they figured the network could soak Tom Steyer for a few million simply by pretending that it costs money to appear in that evening's debate. "Here's what I'm thinking: We just rattle off an email to Tom's campaign mentioning that we hadn't gotten his $2.5 million debate fee, see if any of his staffers bat an eye, and then take things from there," said CNN president Jeff Zucker, noting that his team had already received prompt and courteous payment from Steyer's campaign after sending them an itemized list suggesting the network required reimbursement for the candidate's podium and microphone alongside a per-question fee for Wolf Blitzer's time. "Early on, I told one of his chief aides that we were going to bill them for every word he uttered, and he just nodded and said 'uh-huh, sounds good.' God, he was actually surprised that we were charging them so much less than PBS had at the last debate." At press time, Steyer was spotted frantically searching his suit pockets after a stage tech informed the businessman that he had failed to compensate the network with $500 for its customary entrance fee.

Bernie Sanders Renounces Call For Economic Equality After Brush With Death Teaches Him Money Isn't Everything
WESTERVILLE, OH — Revealing that his heart attack left him worried that he's spent too much time obsessed with things that do not matter, Bernie Sanders renounced his past call for economic equality during Tuesday night's debate after his brush with death taught him that money is not everything. "I've spent 50 years worrying about money, but now I realize that fair wages and housing are not really important — it's people and relationships, it's living in this moment right now," said Sanders, who admitted that recovering from his surgery provided an opportunity to think about how true wealth and power does not come from money; it comes from having a devoted family. "I encourage my supporters to forget about all that nonsense about income inequality. I was all 'jobs, jobs, jobs.' Why was I so obsessed with work and material wellbeing? I wanted a wealth tax, but you can't put a dollar value on a sunset. Money for college won't buy you a baby's smile. I've wasted my life fighting for a massive transfer of wealth, so now I'm fighting for a massive transfer of love." At press time, Sanders had walked over to hug a stunned Beto O'Rourke and told him he loves him.

Trump Supporter Comes Away From Democratic Debate With Pretty Clear Idea Of Which Candidate He's Going To Kill
LANCASTER, OH — Admitting that he had been struggling to identify which candidate he preferred, local Trump supporter James Brimhall told reporters Wednesday that he came away from the Democratic debates with a more clear idea of who he wanted to kill. "Early on, I thought it was definitely going to be Biden, but a lot of other candidates made great points about why they needed to be killed to save America, so I was really torn," said Brimhall, who claimed hearing Bernie Sanders' arguments for universal healthcare put him at the top of his list for a few months. "I was actually flirting with Andrew Yang for a bit — his freedom dividend seems like exactly the kind of idea I need to cleanse from the face of the Earth, but there wasn't much beyond that. I'm honestly leaning towards Warren now. She has a lot of proposals, and her fire during the debate really stood out as something I would want to destroy. Plus, I like that she's a woman." Brimhall added that we would probably hold off making his final decision until after President Trump singles one out as an enemy of America.

Hanukkah Decorations Being Defaced Earlier Every Year

The report noted that many shopping malls have, in recent years, begun playing anti-Semitic carols just days after Halloween.

Ghost Of Christmas Future Taunts Children With Visions Of PlayStation 5
SOUTHFIELD, MI — Bored with scaring elderly misers, the Ghost of Christmas Future is spending the holiday season taunting modern children with visions of Christmas 2016's hottest toy: the Sony PlayStation 5, a 2,048-bit console featuring a 45-Ghz trinary processor, CineReal graphics booster with 2-gig biotexturing, and an RSP connector for 360-degree online-immersion play. "You know how kids are — a year is an eternity to them," the wraithlike specter said Monday during a visit to the Southfield home of 13-year-old Josh Kuehn. "So just imagine showing them something they'll have to wait 14 years for. Teasing them with a glimpse of the PS5 is the ultimate torture. They absolutely lose their minds. It's like saying, 'Hey, kid, you'll be an old man before you ever get to touch this.' The Ghost of Christmas Future said he has visited more than 125,000 homes since Thanksgiving, offering children an agonizing sneak peek at what they cannot have for another decade and a half. "I like to appear in the living room with a PS5 hooked up to 2016's most popular TV, the 4'x8' Hi-Def Sony Titania," the Ghost said. "Then, I'll say in my best spooky voice, 'Jimmy! Behold what your kids will be playing while you're slaving away at an office job to support them!' Driving the children mad with PS5 lust, the Ghost said, is a multi-step process. "I usually start by showing them Toteki Aluminum, one of the future's most popular fight-and-chase games," the Ghost said. "It's far from the best available in 2016, but it always blows their mind to see the guy get hit with the falling sign while the drops of sweat fly off his face. You can see the whole scene, distorted, in each of the individual drops. That gives them a good preliminary idea of the graphics technology we're dealing with. The Ghost said he then likes to show Airsledz, a racing game in which jet-powered sleds whoosh through a four-dimensional racing course in the sky. The game, he said, enables the player to compete online against dozens of other players all around the world. "They always ask if you can play it on the Internet — it's so cute how they still call it 'the Internet' — and I tell them, 'Hey, you can play this against 63 other PS5 owners simultaneously. At least you can in 14 years,'" the Ghost said. "And you should see their jaws hit the floor when they learn about the add-on accessories that enable users to actually fly around the room during gameplay. Once the capabilities of the system are conveyed to the children, the Ghost likes to push them further over the edge by showing them games specially targeted to their age group. Younger children, he said, salivate upon seeing Level One of Zonic Fugue. In it, Zonic, the indigo-colored son of Sonic The Hedgehog, faces off against Chuckles The Echidna in a Terrordactyl sky-joust, attempting to earn the Ankle Rockets he needs to gather the five Chaos Sapphires that, when combined, form the master key that opens the Melody Dome. To break the spirits of children 12 and up, the Ghost runs a brief demonstration of Back To Werewolf Island. The horror-action thriller, he said, will be produced in full 10.8 Omneo sound and feature new music from 40 of 2016's hottest skagcore acts, including FU3P, Dredgerous, and Frances Cobain. "Sometimes, the kids will start getting defensive and say, 'Yeah, well, I don't know any of those characters, so big deal,'" the Ghost said. "That's when I pull out DC vs. Marvel." The Ghost said he shows the children a brief clip of DC vs. Marvel, in which cinema-realistic figures of Spider-Man and the Joker dash across impossibly detailed city streets, attacking each other with dozens of different offensive maneuvers while leaping, somersaulting, and throwing objects. "They usually start trembling at that point," the Ghost said. "That's when I go in for the kill by casually mentioning that the game comes packaged with the 2016 feature film of the same name — not on DVD, of course, but on SCAP. Ten times better. The few children unbroken by DC vs. Marvel are invariably finished off by the sight of Star Wars — Episode IX: Jedi Destiny, a game which employs the world's most advanced artificial-intelligence algorithm to place the player inside the film's climactic battle sequence on the planet Mon Jeedam. "With more than 12,000 distinct soldiers, creatures, and vehicles fighting at once, and the option to command the New Republic Fleet, the Imperial Armada, or the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion Force, it's not merely the best Star Wars game that's ever existed; it's an interactive film that looks better than any movie that's ever been made. No child has failed to sob hysterically at the sight of it. The PlayStation 5 will be available in stores Nov. 12, 2016, at a list price of Δ399 New Dollars ($199 Canadian).

Scientists Develop New Extra-Sloppy Peach
DAVIS, CA — Explaining that the latest strain of the fruit was far softer and runnier than previous varieties, agricultural scientists at the University of California, Davis announced Thursday the successful development of a new extra-sloppy peach. "We used a combination of selective breeding and genetic modification methods to engineer a new type of peach that just gushes all over your face the second you bite into it," said head researcher Margot Corman, adding that the peach variety is so slushy that the flesh of the ripened fruit instantly liquefies in your palm, causing the juice to run all the way down your arms and drip from your elbows. "The peach is so wet and mushy that the skin just slides off, and the whole fruit loses its form and turns into a puddle of glop if squeezed." The scientists confirmed that the sweet, oozing fruit is best consumed over a sink while shirtless.

John Hickenlooper Sets Ambitious $250 Fundraising Goal For Next Debate Cycle
DENVER — Calling upon donors to take his campaign to new, unprecedented heights, Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper set an ambitious $250 fundraising goal Tuesday for next the debate cycle. "It certainly won't be easy, but with your help, we can grow from a grassroots campaign with virtually nothing to a grassroots campaign with $250 dollars," said Hickenlooper at a recent rally, bucking the warnings of advisors who cautioned him to stay below an "already insane" $100 ceiling for the next financial quarter. "I know it sounds impossible now, but if 25,000 Americans donate just one cent to Hickenlooper 2020, we'll reach $250 in no time. That's why I'm introducing exclusive merchandise, meet-and-greets, and private dinners for top-tier donors who give within the $1 to $5 range." At press time, sources confirmed that Hickenlooper's campaign funds were still stuck at zero.

Psychologists Say It Perfectly Natural To Fantasize About Sandwiches Other Than One Currently In Hand
BOULDER, CO — Saying such feelings of desire were observed in nearly every individual they studied, psychologists from the University of Colorado released a report Thursday concluding that it is perfectly natural for people to fantasize about sandwiches other than the one presently in their hands. The study, which surveyed more than 500 adults from a variety of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, determined that 89 percent of subjects had, at least once during the previous six months, vividly imagined a different sandwich while sitting down at the table with their current hero, hoagie, or po' boy. "While many people may find it distressing or shameful when they begin mentally picturing a sandwich that's nothing like the one they are holding, our findings suggest that these thoughts are, in fact, a completely normal biological impulse," said Dr. Kelly Sohn, the report's lead author. "You should by no means feel any sense of regret or embarrassment if you suddenly find yourself mid-bite feeling curious about a particularly striking BLT that caught your eye while you were walking by a café earlier that day or letting your thoughts drift to a pastrami on rye you used to have in college." "Even if you're completely satisfied with the sandwich sitting right in front of you, it is purely an instinctual response to become overwhelmed by a strong desire to taste one that's very different," Sohn added. "It's just human nature." According to the research team, it is particularly common for individuals to indulge in fantasies about exotic sandwiches from foreign culinary traditions, like Cubans or Vietnamese bánh mìs, that they have never tried before. Additionally, Sohn said that many subjects reported finding themselves particularly drawn to bigger, beefier sandwiches or those with larger meatballs, often causing them to imagine these alluring features on their own, plainer sandwich when they later sit down for a meal. Researchers also explained that, on average, a person imagines a different sandwich than the one they're currently holding about once every week, though a sizable minority of respondents reportedly acknowledged engaging in such fantasies every single time they had lunch. "It's important to remember that mentally picturing a piled-high Reuben when you're eating the same chicken salad sandwich you always get is by and large the product of reflexive brain activity over which you have very little control," said Sohn, adding that Americans are constantly bombarded with images of picture-perfect subs and idealized pulled pork sandwiches on billboards and television, further explaining the ubiquity of the phenomenon. "In fact, we found that when people are able to unlearn the guilt that is often associated with these harmless fantasies, it can actually make the enjoyment of one's own sandwich that much more satisfying." "The real danger lies in unnecessarily punishing oneself for these thoughts, which can eventually diminish the gratification one derives from eating sandwiches altogether," she continued. Sohn further assured the public that it was normal for such fantasies to become extremely vivid and complex. In particular, she noted that 63 percent of subjects had reported that on one or more occasions, they had imagined themselves eating their desired sandwich in an uncommon location, such as in a car, aboard a plane, or even in front of other people in public. Experts also confirmed that more atypical fantasies, such as eating a sandwich in a hot tub or devouring two sandwiches at once, were, in most cases, perfectly normal as well. "It's such a relief to know I'm not some weirdo or a bad person for checking out my brother's spicy Italian when we went out to lunch a few weeks ago — I felt so guilty about that," said 42-year-old study participant Craig Worsley, who told reporters he couldn't help but imagine sinking his teeth into the sandwich's thick layers of salami, capicola, and provolone until tangy vinaigrette dribbled all down his chin. "Don't get me wrong, I liked the patty melt I ordered just fine, but man, I looked at his sandwich and couldn't help but think, 'Damn, that thing is stacked.' " Added Worsley, "But now I understand I'm just like any other person out there with a normal, healthy appetite." Researchers stated that a small percentage of deeply troubled individuals reported fantasizing about salads while eating their sandwiches, and recommended that anyone experiencing these types of perverse, abnormal thoughts immediately seek psychological counseling.

Rolex Unveils New Diving Cuckoo Clock Capable Of Working Up To 3,000 Meters Underwater
GENEVA — Touting their new timepiece as a marvel of modern horology, watchmaker Rolex unveiled a diver's cuckoo clock Thursday capable of keeping accurate time at undersea depths of up to 3,000 meters. "Whether you're surveying the depths of the Mariana Trench or just taking your submarine out for a spin, the waterproof, pressure-sealed Oysterquartz clock makes the perfect undersea companion," a press release touting the product's specifications read in part, noting the combination of craftsmanship and technology that allows the clock to stay accurate to within 100 milliseconds, the detachable hook that easily attaches to standard mounts of most watercraft, and the ornithologically correct cuckoo on its machined steel extension armature. "When you buy a Rolex Perpetual Cuckoo Sub-Mariner, you know you're getting the most durable, highest quality clock available, and one that will long outlast others in its class." Rolex announced that the clock would make its public debut in the next James Bond film.

Tom Izzo Calls 2019 Spartans Best Team He's Ever Threatened With Violence
MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Crediting his players for being wise enough to do what's best for their health, Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo told reporters Saturday that this Spartans team was the best he's ever threatened with violence. "In my 20-plus years at East Lansing, I've had the privilege of threatening to pummel some incredible players, but none of them have ever responded to my murderous rants like these guys," said Izzo, who showered praise on the team for winning the Big 10 tournament, so he didn't have to follow through on his promise to "choke them out" if they lost. "Whether I'm browbeating them at practice or vowing to kill their parents if they don't get back on defense, I just know these guys are going to give it their all. I've promised to cut up amazing players from Jason Richardson to Denzel Valentine, but seeing how these guys play defense after I threaten to run them over with my car is truly something special." At press time, Izzo enlisted the help of Spartan alum Draymond Green to give the team a motivational death threat before their Final Four game against Texas Tech.

Family Respects Grandmother's Wishes To Have Open-Bloused Funeral
SOUTHAMPTON, PA — Insisting that it was just their nana's "special way" of saying goodbye, mourners confirmed Friday that the Shreve family had respected their grandmother's wishes to have an opened-bloused funeral. "I know it makes some people a little uncomfortable to see her lying there, shirt open and tits out, but this is how she wanted to be remembered," said 59-year-old family matriarch Cecelia Shreve through tears, who went on to credit the mortician's tasteful presentation, and for "making those knockers look 20 years younger." "You know, it's not for everyone, but I think seeing her rack out in the open really helped bring the room some closure. Unfortunately, it still doesn't change the fact that tomorrow, I have to wake up in a world where my mom and her beautiful bazongas aren't around anymore. God bless 'the girls.' " At press time, the Shreve family rushed to console Cecelia, who had started to sob uncontrollably after kissing her mother on the chest one last time.

Outraged Trump Declares He Would've Gotten Jeffrey Epstein Way More Lenient Plea Deal
WASHINGTON — As he lambasted the plea bargain that put Jeffrey Epstein behind bars for 13 months while allowing him to leave prison six days a week, a visibly angered President Trump declared Wednesday that if he been in charge, the alleged sex trafficker would have received a far lighter sentence. "This was absolutely the worst deal in all of legal history, and I'm disgusted by the way it played out," said the 45th president of the United States, adding that back in 2008, he could easily have negotiated an arrangement that would have kept Epstein out of a white-collar jail in Palm Beach, FL and "on his private jet, where he belongs." "If they had let me handle that case, Jeffrey would have been a completely free man, and he never would have had to register as a sex offender, which was just totally ridiculous. It's sickening what those incompetent lawyers did. It sends a terrible message." At press time, Trump had given a televised address from the Oval Office during which he issued a full presidential pardon to Epstein and anyone who may have conspired with him in the sex trafficking of minors.

Maybelline Introduces New Ideal-Woman Rubber Mask To Use In Place Of Makeup
NEW YORK — Touting it as their most stylish and advanced beauty product to date, officials from global cosmetics brand Maybelline unveiled Thursday the Ideal-Woman Rubber Mask, a flexible facial covering that can be worn over the head in lieu of makeup. "Instead of spending hours each morning applying multiple cosmetic products, now women can simply roll out of bed, grab their stunning latex polymer beauty mask that has been molded to accepted standards of female beauty, and stretch it snugly over their face and hair," Maybelline spokeswoman Jessica Healy said of the one-size-fits-all contoured masks, which designers carefully crafted with rouged cheeks, pouty full lips, high cheekbones, and a small taut chin for maximum physical appeal. "In the short time it takes to line up the mask's mouth, nose, and eye holes with your own features, you'll easily achieve a look that would have otherwise taken hours to create, allowing you to confidently go through the day without ever having to pause to reapply." Maybelline executives noted that the Ideal-Woman Rubber Mask is only available in Caucasian.

Catholic Church Not About To Be Out-Molested By Goddamn Boy Scouts
VATICAN CITY — Telling the youth organization that if they come for the king they best not miss, the Catholic Church announced Thursday that it was not about to be out-molested by the goddamn Boy Scouts. "If some pissant organization like the Scouts thinks they can beat us at the molestation game, then they have another fucking thing coming," said Pope Francis, directing his message to the Scouts' leaders as he stressed that a couple thousand piddling cases was a drop in the bucket compared to the generations of sexual abuse that had made the Catholic Church number-one in molestation for centuries on end. "We're talking hundreds of thousands of parishioners, children, and nuns abused by the people they trust most. Plus, we're not doing it while hiding out in the woods like a bunch of cowards. We're just at the back of the church, putting up huge numbers on the board day after day. So don't come at us with this weak-ass shit, Boy Scouts. We're the OG diddlers around here." At press time, the Catholic Church had offered to send a few dozen priests to the Boy Scouts of America to show them how it's done.

Small Business Still Manages To Mistreat Workers Like Large Corporate Chain
MARFA, TX — Employees at Gillman's Hardware confirmed Monday that despite the company's small size, single location, and the fact that it has been family owned and operated for over 35 years, it still manages to treat its staff as if they worked at a faceless multinational chain. "Sure, there are only 15 or so employees here, but our supervisors really make us feel like we're completely valueless and replaceable," said sales associate Alex Waverly, 27, citing touches like a lack of health benefits, the expectation that he stay late stacking bags of mulch without collecting overtime, and the prohibition against sitting on the sample deck chairs or anywhere else at any point during his six-hour shifts. "It's a local hardware store; you don't expect cold, corporate practices like getting patted down whenever you leave for lunch to ensure you haven't shoplifted, or not earning a single cent above minimum wage, but somehow they're able to foster that kind of environment." Waverly added that it was also nice to see the store sticking to its philosophy by holding onto every last dollar earned, rather than investing any of it back into the community.

God Recounts Torrid Affair With Michelangelo That Began When Posing For Sistine Chapel Fresco
THE HEAVENS — Calling the years of the whirlwind romance amongst the greatest of His life, Supreme Being and Creator of All Things God recounted Wednesday the torrid affair with 16th-century Italian artist Michelangelo that began when He posed for the Sistine Chapel fresco The Creation Of Adam. "At first, we agreed to keep My modeling strictly professional, but a friendship slowly blossomed, and as he began to study My contours, it grew into something far more sensual," said the Lord Almighty, who recalled tender evenings in the summer of 1508 spent bonding over glasses of wine, a practice that eventually led to the omnipotent deity agreeing to let the Renaissance master sketch Him nude. "Of course, it was once I disrobed that sparks really started to fly, but it was never just a physical thing between us. We really clicked on an emotional level, too. Some might think it's demeaning to serve as another's muse, but for Me there's something incredibly romantic about the relationship. When I look at the final product, every stroke of the painting, every tiny detail, evokes the flame that burned in his heart for Me. I mean, those two fingers you see touching in the painting? That was our thing in bed." God went on to note that all of this made it especially hard to have to kill Michelangelo a mere half century later.

Man Feels Pressure To Propose After Dating Girlfriend For 3 Years, Buying Ring, Getting Down On One Knee
VENICE, ITALY — Saying he can tell from the way she's been looking at him that she clearly expects him to pop the question, local man Dwayne Moyer told reporters Friday he feels pressure to propose to his girlfriend, Samantha Firks, after dating her for three years, buying her a ring, and getting down on one knee. "Man, just because we've been together for a while, and because I knelt before her and opened a velvet box containing a $10,000 diamond ring, she's suddenly acting like it's time we got engaged," said Moyer, explaining how he flew his significant other to Italy for their anniversary, hired a string quartet to serenade Firks, and was now being made to feel as if he had no choice but to ask her to be his wife. "It really isn't fair of her to do this. I hinted that today was going to be a 'special,' paid a professional photographer to capture the moment, and this is what I get in return? A guilt trip about getting married? To make matters worse, ever since I asked her father's permission for her hand in marriage, her whole family has been bugging me about when I'm going to do it, which is making me super uncomfortable." Moyer added that he was also feeling pressure to have kids with Firks now that the couple had finally succeeded after months of trying to conceive a child together.

Car Ride Devoted To Explaining What Things Will Be Different About Grandma This Visit

"Remember, kids, Nana is slowing down these days and she can't walk anymore, so don't expect her to chase you around," said Gritton, adding that her mother, Cecelia, may not recognize them. "When you hug Grandma, you might notice that she's lost some weight recently, but don't worry — she's still your Grandma. She can't really hear that well these days, and she's very tired. We're going to have to be quiet and on our best behavior." At press time, Gritton and her kids had finally arrived at their grandmother's funeral.

Biden Asks Advisors How Much Longer He Has To Pretend To Be Confused And Doddering To Avoid Criticism
DES MOINES, IA — Cutting off his chief strategist midway through a daily meeting to express his unwillingness to continue the deception much longer, former Vice President Joe Biden reportedly asked advisors Wednesday how much longer he has to go through the routine of acting confused and doddering in order to avoid criticism. "Please, guys, I'm so tired of putting on this whole song-and-dance of stumbling over my words at every public appearance and painfully wincing so it seems like I've completely forgotten a foreign leader's name," said the presumptive frontrunner, looking at each and every one of his advisors with clear, thoughtful eye contact, while stressing that although his consistent lead in polling showed the strategy had worked spectacularly to shield him from any critique of his record, he also longed to drop this "entire frail-old-man act" and speak to audiences in full sentences that allowed him to robustly articulate his vision for restoring America's soul. "Just give me a date when I can start fully enunciating my words in TV spots. That's all. Obviously, I can keep doing the simple stuff like biting my wife's finger or challenging audience members to push-up contests seemingly out of nowhere. I know you think that's helpful. I get that it would sink me in the polls if I were held accountable for past statements and actions, but frankly it's just exhausting to be constantly acting this mentally confused when I know I can be so much stronger out there." At press time, Biden was begging his advisors to at least never again make him punch himself midway through a debate to give the appearance of his eye filling up with blood.

Biden Hands Out Loose GT Cola Can To Unexpected Trick-Or-Treater
DOVER, DE — Telling his only trick-or-treater to "hang tight a sec while Uncle Joe scares up some Halloween goodies," former Vice President Joe Biden reportedly disappeared and returned 10 minutes later with a warm can of GT Cola, sources confirmed Friday. "Here ya go, bud. Thought I could hook you up with a spare ramen flavor packet, but I must've gotten a mean case of the munchies — didn't bargain on any other visitors when I left on the porch light for my main squeeze," said Biden, cautioning the child that she might want to give the rim a quick rinse first, since the garage fridge where he found the soda can was "kind of on the blink." "That's a badass little getup you're sportin' there. Reminds me of the time I caught Poison's '86 Halloween show dressed as a California Raisin. I don't remember jack except ending the night with a naughty nurse I met backstage, though I coulda saved myself a fat lip if I knew she was banging Bret Michaels, too." According to sources, Biden then darted back into his house after remembering he had just bought a "shit-ton" of caramel edibles.

Woman Knows Smiling Husband Not Really Flirting With Her But It's Fun To Pretend
TEMPE — Indulging herself with a few moments of impossibly romantic fantasy, local woman Lori Danforth admitted Monday that despite knowing her husband's socialized smile is not an example of him actually flirting with her it was still enjoyable to pretend that this was in fact the case. "I sometimes like to spend a few moments imagining what life would be like if my husband's habit of grinning and making eye contact was more than just him being polite," said Danforth, who despite her rich inner fantasy life, nevertheless remains painfully aware of the true nature of her relationship. "I know neither of us would ever risk the lives we've so carefully built by acting on this, so there's really no use in hoping that it could even lead to anything real. Maybe if I were a little bit younger, things would be different, but for now, it's just nice to make-believe." For his part, husband Arthur Danforth confirmed that his grin wouldn't lead to anything because he has a serious girlfriend.

Sanders Unveils Job-Training Program To Provide Meaningful Work To Low-Skilled Op-Ed Writers
WASHINGTON — Explaining that as president he would ensure his policies didn't leave any Americans behind, Senator Bernie Sanders reportedly unveiled plans Wednesday for a job-training program that would provide meaningful work to low-skilled op-ed writers. "I understand that if I win the presidency, many Americans are concerned about the effect that changing economic priorities will have on their jobs, which is why I'm committed to making sure that the nation's unskilled columnists receive every opportunity to learn material skills that will enable them to find a rewarding position," said Sanders, adding that his platform allocated hundreds of millions of dollars a year to ensure workers like opinion columnists who lacked qualifications for any skilled labor job would receive instruction in a career of their choice, such as nursing, childcare, or construction. "It's true that not every industry makes sense for the world we need to build, whether it's coal mining, private health insurance, or writing histrionic editorials with little factual basis in our nation's newspapers. It pains me to see so many op-ed writers out there who have received so little training or education that they have no capacity to do viable work. But I believe that these op-ed writers and editorial board members want to be productive members of society, and my presidency will do everything it can to help them find work with dignity." Sanders added that it was an unfortunate result of the U.S. economic system that so many Americans found themselves stuck in low-skilled op-ed writing jobs in the first place.

Hallmark Apologizes For Role In Supplying Third Reich With Greeting Cards
KANSAS CITY, MO — Proclaiming their deep and sincere regret for any role their extensive line of greeting cards may have played in one of the darkest chapters of history, event-commemoration giant Hallmark apologized Friday for supplying Hitler's infamous Third Reich with greeting cards from 1938 to mid-1945. "We deeply regret our actions in not only designing and printing but also distributing millions of Hallmark-brand greeting cards to political officials, military leaders, and Wehrmacht soldiers across Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe," said Hallmark CEO Donald J. Hall Jr. in a statement on the company's website which publicly acknowledged the mass production of "Get Well Soon," "Congratulations On The Great Victory," and "Birthday Of The Führer" cards for use across Hitler's regime. "While we cannot erase the fact that our products helped Nazis celebrate their most special occasions, we hope to make reparations through our present actions. To those who suffered at the hands of the Gestapo while their stormtroopers were heartened and uplifted by Hallmark-brand "Keep Up The Good Work" cards: We sincerely hope you — and the world — can forgive us." Hallmark also announced that the company would be sending all Holocaust survivors the condolence cards they deserve and sadly, never received.

"Please do me a solid and say my name is Jerry or Tim or something," said running back Paul Perkins, noting that he had hoped to avoid humiliating his family members and friends who would likely be watching the Thanksgiving Day game. "I can't have my family name associated with this. It would crush my mother, so please just either make up a name or say mine super fast. I'll owe you one." At press time, Eli Manning was reportedly asking NBC producers to also blur the image of him used in the lineup graphics.

Everyone At Thanksgiving Doing Chore To Get Away From Rest Of Family
PHOENIX, AZ — Unanimously insisting that the 17 separate tasks would only take a moment and be no trouble at all, each and every member of the Blake family present for Thanksgiving dinner Thursday reportedly undertook a chore in order to get some time away from the rest of their family. "Here, now, I can take the trash out. I really don't mind, it's no trouble, please don't get up," said 54-year-old family patriarch Frank Blake, volunteering for a task that would take him outside for a six- to eight-minute break from his from his wife and adult children, who had in turn spent the last five hours busying themselves with various tasks in order to avoid interacting with one another on the family-centric holiday. "After I set the cans by the curb, why don't I just, you know, run down to the basement and grab the centerpieces. I can even get the extra folding chairs [and linger there for as long as I can so I don't have to spend time with you guys] while I'm down there. You guys just enjoy your holiday." At press time, the entire Blake family was concocting excuses to run to the store in separate cars to prevent any chances of having to make conversation.

Biden To Honor Fallen Soldiers By Jumping Motorcycle Over Vietnam Memorial
WASHINGTON — In an effort to honor fallen American soldiers this Memorial Day with a fittingly "badass" tribute, Vice President Joe Biden has announced plans to jump a motorcycle over the entire length of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Biden, who called an emergency press conference at the White House Saturday, said members of the U.S. armed forces who sacrificed their lives in the service of their country deserved a death-defying stunt that involves clearing the 246-foot-long monument on a "souped-up" Harley-Davidson XR-750. "There's no better way to pay homage to our fallen brothers than by letting it rip, hitting that ramp at full fucking blast, and flying through the sky high above the Vietnam Memorial," said Biden, noting that he also plans to execute a midair salute by placing his fingers around his mouth in a V shape and rapidly flicking his tongue. "If I grease the landing and ragdoll across the Constitution Gardens, so be it. I've had my share of spills. "Ain't like I haven't broken a few bones or fractured my skull a couple times, either," the vice president added. Biden told reporters he has spent all his free time over the past two weeks preparing for the perilous feat by tuning up his bike, overseeing construction of the plywood ramps, and personally installing a "bitchin'" sound system that will blast a to-be-determined John Mellencamp song from 20 different speakers during the jump. The vice president said that to properly commemorate the bravery of America's fallen service members, he will also ride the motorcycle through a massive banner reading "All gave some, some gave all," which will be held in place by "a couple of hot numbers in bikinis" whom the vice president reportedly met during a recent trip to a D.C.-area Texas Roadhouse location. After urging members of the media not to miss out because the performance is going to be "the shit," Biden spoke at length about modifications he has made to the bike to ensure he gets "big-time air. "Get ready, hombres — I slapped a thousand cc's of muscle on this baby and they're gonna hear it roar from here to the Pentagon," the vice president said. "Plus I added an extra 80 horsepower with a sweet supercharger, 'cause if you're gonna honor our boys, you've gotta do it right. "Even got a custom-built POW-MIA flag that will be flying from the back of my hog as I'm soaring overhead," Biden continued. In response to numerous questions about the risk of injury, Biden assured the White House press corps that a safety crew equipped with fire extinguishers will be on hand to quickly douse any flames on his body in the event of a crash. The vice president also claimed that should an accident occur, he probably wouldn't feel anything, because he intended to get "fairly tanked" before performing the jump. "Anyway, I'll have a helmet on, and of course I'll be wearing my star-spangled red, white, and blue leather jumpsuit," Biden said. "It zips down real low, and I plan to keep it open. The ladies can follow the treasure trail to a little patch action. Although this is the vice president's most ambitious jump to date, in 2010 he honored the troops on Veteran's Day by vaulting over 14 tombstones at Arlington National Cemetery, but then "ate it" on the 15th grave, spending two weeks in a coma. As of press time, the six-term Delaware senator was reportedly spotted popping wheelies and doing burnouts on the National Mall.

Harvard Officials Say $8.9 Million Donation From Jeffrey Epstein Was From Brief Recovery Period When He Wasn't A Pedophile
CAMBRIDGE, MA — Emphasizing that the late billionaire was only having sex with consenting adults at the time, Harvard officials said Friday that the nearly $9 million Jeffrey Epstein gave to the university was received during a brief recovery period when he did not engage in pedophilia. "I want to be clear: These donations were made only at times when Mr. Epstein was not actively involved in molesting, raping, or trafficking underage girls," said Harvard President Lawrence Bacow, adding that the university had monitored the convicted felon's sex life closely to ensure all checks were written and deposited during intervals in which Epstein completely abstained from intercourse with children. "While Jeffrey struggled, and eventually relapsed into pedophilia, I want to assure our community that Harvard went to great lengths not to accept his money while he abused minors. In addition, I can confirm that when Epstein was a visiting fellow in our Psychology Department back in 2005, he only had sex with women who had turned 18." Bacow later clarified that the university's anti-pedophile policy only applied to Epstein and would not have any effect on Harvard emeritus law professor Alan Dershowitz.

Democrats Criticize Trump For Attacking Greta Thunberg Instead Of Praising Her Bravery, Ignoring Her Later
WASHINGTON — Describing his behavior as deeply inappropriate, Democratic leaders roundly criticized President Donald Trump Tuesday for attacking climate activist Greta Thunberg instead of just offering her praise and then subsequently ignoring her. "Yet again, we have seen the cruel and vindictive nature of a president who thinks it's acceptable to hurl schoolyard taunts at this wonderful young woman instead of acting very interested in what she has to say and then doing nothing whatsoever about it," said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, adding that this incident raised questions about the fundamental decency of someone who would mock a 12-year-old activist when he should be gleaning whatever social capital he can from her and then pretending as though she never existed. "I want to say right now to Ms. Thunberg that Donald Trump's dismissive comments do not represent the country as a whole. I assure you that the next time you want to speak to leaders who could benefit from being associated with climate activism, the Democratic party is here for you as long as the cameras are rolling and not a second longer." Hoyer went on to condemn Fox News for launching ad hominem attacks against Thunberg instead of merely criticizing her proposals as unrealistic and anti-business.

Biden Huddling With Closest Advisers On Whether To Spend 200 Bucks On Scorpions Tickets
WASHINGTON — In an effort to carefully weigh every option before determining his future, Vice President Joe Biden reportedly huddled with several of his closest advisers Friday to decide whether to "pony up 200 smackers" for Scorpions tickets. "This is the toughest decision I've faced — sure, it's Rudy Schenker and the boys from Hanover we're talking about, but I don't know if I can swing 200 bones for just one night of the Scorps," said Biden, who reportedly took a large swig from a Keystone tallboy while listening to his chief of staff Steve Ricchetti debate with fellow confidants T-Bone and The Gooch about the merits of scoring tickets from a scalper in the parking lot. "Shit, I guess Candi could slip into that low-cut number of hers and distract security with the goods while I sneak into a service entrance. Pretty damn risky, and I ain't too keen on spending another night in the clink like I did back in '84 during the Love At First Sting tour. This could be my last shot; I'm not sure Joe will be around for the Scorpions' 75th anniversary tour." At press time, Biden announced plans to form an exploratory committee to look into the possibility of acquiring Scorpions tickets in exchange for a pair of 240-watt Pioneer stereo speakers.

Biden Searching White House One Last Time For Missing Pet Snake
WASHINGTON — Urging staffers to keep their eyes peeled for a "scaly little fucker without any legs," Vice President Joe Biden reportedly searched the White House one last time Wednesday for his missing 12-year-old pet coral snake, Fruit Loop. "Look, I just found a discarded skin on a chair in the Roosevelt Room, so I know he's still slithering around here someplace," said Biden, who sources confirmed rummaged through the drawers of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and crawled around on his hands and knees peering underneath furniture for the 3-foot-long snake. "Fruit Loop can't be far — he usually hauls ass straight for the East Wing whenever he flies the coop. If you hear something weird going on in the pipes, just get me on the horn and I'll come lickety-split with a pole to snatch him. I can't fuck up again — I'm already on thin ice after he mixed it up with Bo during the 2014 Easter Egg Roll." At press time, Biden was dangling a dead mouse near the White House kitchen's oven and calling the snake's name.

LONDON — Claiming that the fate of the Realm was dependent on the Prince's continual satisfaction in all his physical needs, Queen Elizabeth II summoned Meghan Markle to her royal bedchamber Friday, where she embraced her granddaughter-to-be, slowly dimmed the lights, and proclaimed, "We must ensure you have the skills to please my grandson," before letting her nightgown slip languorously to the floor. "As queen, it is my responsibility to properly train you in the erotic duties expected of the Crown," said the 91-year-old Queen Regnant, ushering her future granddaughter-in-law toward a luxurious canopy bed on which an assortment of feather ticklers, blindfolds, and other pleasure-enhancing items had been carefully arranged. "The fate of all England may someday hinge on you indulging the desires of your husband-to-be in a way befitting a prince; thus, I shall guide you through all the carnal wisdom of our regal forebears, every sensual escalation and lascivious technique known to arouse royal blood. The tantric secrets of Mary, Queen of Scots alone have the power to bring the most frigid of kings and consorts to a transport of ecstasy." The Queen then reportedly began the process of confirming that Markle was indeed yet a virgin.

Homeless, Disheveled Prince Harry Spotted Eating Out Of Garbage Can Just 24 Hours After Stepping Away From Monarchy
NORTHAMPTON, ENGLAND — According to eyewitnesses at the scene, a homeless and thoroughly disheveled Prince Harry was spotted Monday eating out of residential garbage cans only 24 hours after stepping away from the Royal Family. "I heard a clatter in the alleyway, so I circled around and found him rooting around in my trash and kind of quietly muttering to himself," said Northamptonshire resident Sarah Christie, describing the unshaven, filth-covered Duke of Sussex as "clearly not in a good place" in the wake of announcing plans to distance himself from the British monarchy, while expressing concern about the senior royal's bloodshot eyes and foul stench. "I asked if he needed help, but he just hissed at me and went back to sucking on this half-eaten chicken bone he'd rooted up. Frankly, I was trying to keep my distance because I wasn't 100% sure he wasn't going to lunge." At press time, Christie had called the police after witnessing the Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle repeatedly attempt to sell off her baby to people waiting at a nearby bus stop.

Biden Frantically Hitting Up Cabinet Members For Clean Piss
WASHINGTON — A cabinet meeting in the White House's West Wing was reportedly interrupted early Thursday morning when an agitated Vice President Joe Biden suddenly barged in, asking if anyone could "hook [him] up with a Dixie cup" of their urine. "C'mon, you gotta help me get some clean whiz — Shinseki, Donovan, I'm looking in your direction," said Biden, who implored all 15 heads of the executive-branch departments not to say anything, noting he would be in "deep shit" if they did. "I'm not fucking around. I need some lizard juice, pronto. And dudes only — I can't get found out like I did last time." According to sources, Biden then hurried out of the room, vowing to return with bottles of water in case anyone needed help "kickstarting their hogs."

Majority Of Americans Voice Support For Bernie Sanders After Learning He's A Millionaire
WASHINGTON — Saying they are now convinced the candidate is overwhelmingly qualified to lead the country, a majority of Americans have shifted their support to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2020 presidential race since learning he is a millionaire, a Pew Research Center poll found Wednesday. "I have my reservations about his policies, but if the guy's a millionaire, he must know what he's doing," said Cleveland-area voter Glenn Mannix, 48, echoing the sentiments of 68% of the voting populace, who were reportedly impressed upon discovering the royalties Sanders has earned on sales of his books has pushed his net worth to seven figures. "Anyone who's smart enough to make a million dollars has got to have some pretty great ideas about how to move our country in the right direction. You don't get to be that rich and successful without having a really good head on your shoulders. The man has my vote!" According to the poll, the remaining 32% of voters agree with all of Sanders' policies, but said they cannot bring themselves to cast their ballot for someone who owns three homes.

SANTA FE, NM — Explaining that the new novel would be a radical departure from his previous work, best-selling author George R.R. Martin reportedly told readers "Fuck you" while announcing Monday that the next book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series will feature pixies and Dracula. "Guess what, shitheads, this next installment is going to be loaded with fairies and vampires, and everything will take place in the Millennium Falcon," said Martin, raising both middle fingers in the air as he revealed the new book would be called Suck My Dick, You Fucking Dweebs. "Not only is Jon Snow not in this next one, but you're going to find out that he was a figment of everyone's imagination the whole time. I'm in it though, because I'm the hero, and I'm aided by a band of foul-mouthed Lego Bionicles and, fuck it, I just added some minions too." Martin went on to say that it didn't even matter what was in the book because after he finished writing it, he was just going to burn it in front of all his pathetic fans.

Report: None Of Good Cousins Coming To Thanksgiving This Year
SCHENECTADY, NY — In a highly disappointing development expected to put a damper on the entire holiday weekend, sources within the Cunningham family confirmed Tuesday that none of the good cousins are coming to this year's Thanksgiving gathering. "Mom said Uncle Larry and Aunt Jan are staying in Rochester, which means [cousins] Tyler and Lauren won't be here," said Sara Cunningham, 14, noting the out-of-town relatives' absence would make the upcoming get-together in Schenectady the first Thanksgiving in recent memory not to include even one of the good cousins. "Whenever Tyler and Lauren come over, we always play touch football out back and stay up late watching crazy YouTube videos. And they usually stay with us until Sunday, which is really fun." "I don't get why they aren't coming," she continued. "This sucks." According to sources, the news about Tyler and Lauren, from Mom's side of the family, follows last month's discouraging announcement that none of the good cousins on Dad's side would be attending either — including Lindsey, Nick, and most notably Kelsey, who is older and who is highly admired for her stories about what high school's like, as well as her knowledge of cool music. As a result, preliminary reports indicate the holiday will be dominated by less fun and more introverted cousins such as John, who barely talks and will probably sit alone and read a book the entire weekend, and Samantha, who is back from college and will likely hang out with Mom and Aunt Toni in the kitchen the whole time. The Cunningham children described numerous disadvantages of the situation, saying that the kids' table would be "really boring" this year without the good cousins, who like to joke around and make fun of Uncle Mike's weird clothes. In addition, the outright lack of good cousins precludes the possibility of engaging in fun recreational activities while the adults all sit around and talk, with sources pointing out that in years past, Nick has brought his Xbox and all four of his controllers. Additionally, sources remarked that with none of the good cousins present, there wouldn't be enough people to get a decent game of Apples to Apples going, even if the bad cousins were to join in, which they almost never do. "Last year, I spent most of Thanksgiving dinner talking with the good cousins about how awesome Thor: The Dark World was, but this time it's just going to be lame," said Patrick, 12, explaining that his quiet cousin John still gets upset when you swear in front of him, even though he's in sixth grade now. "I really wish Kelsey was coming. She has her driver's license, and last year she drove us to the mall a couple times. There's no way Samantha will do that. If we ask her, she'll probably just roll her eyes and say something about how we should all be volunteering at a soup kitchen instead. This is going to be awful." "I don't understand why we're even having Thanksgiving here if none of the good cousins can come," he added. At press time, the outlook for the holidays had become even gloomier following the late-breaking announcement that the Cunningham family would be driving six hours to Altoona, PA to spend Christmas with Aunt Toni and Uncle Mike, who don't even have cable.

Kanye West: 'I Would've Ridden Away From A Slave Plantation On A Motorcycle First Chance I Got'
LOS ANGELES — Insisting that the legal, centuries-long practice of slavery in America could never have limited his personal or artistic ambitions, Kanye West stated Wednesday that if he had been born into captivity, he would have simply escaped the plantation on his motorcycle "the first chance [he] got." "If that slave owner so much as fixed his lips to say something to me, I would've just hopped on my Harley and ridden to freedom — probably would've popped a wheelie through the cotton fields as I peeled off, too," said the Grammy Award winner, adding that while he "vibed with certain Negro spirituals," there was simply no way he would subject himself to the hardships of slavery. "There's nothing that could ever stop me from making music. Point-blank. I would've parked my chopper at the studio and recorded an album about my experiences in the fields, inspiring slaves throughout the land to free themselves from their mental prison." At press time, sources confirmed West had taken to social media to unveil a new line of tour merchandise loosely inspired by the Underground Railroad.

'Game Of Thrones' Actors Reveal Reading Script For Zombie Battle And Realizing They Wasted Careers
NEW YORK — Discussing their astonishment mere hours after the premiere of the highly anticipated episode, Game Of Thrones actors told reporters Monday about the moment they read the script for the zombie battle in "The Long Night" and realized they had definitively wasted their careers. "Right away, when I finished the script, I felt this sense of immense loss at throwing away the prime of my life performing in a make-believe world of CGI dragons and giants," said series regular Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who described feeling stunned when discovering that he had squandered day after day of his precious existence freezing his ass off in Belfast-based shoots just to play a mediocre role in an emotionally incoherent series that had stretched on for years too long. "I'll never forget when [showrunner] David Benioff sat me down and told me the fate of the Night King and I thought: Who gives a flying fuck? What am I still doing on this show? Jesus Christ, I actually cried." At press time, several cast members told interviewers about having their breath taken away after learning their characters survived the battle and that they still had to film three more episodes of this goddamn thing.

'Game Of Thrones' Creators Frantically Re-Shoot Finale To Make Peter Dinklage Death Seem Intentional
LOS ANGELES — In an effort to create the illusion that the horrific decapitation was deliberate, Game Of Thrones producers were frantically re-shooting the series finale Tuesday to make Peter Dinklage's death seem intentional. "Christ, okay, shit, maybe we can get some B-roll footage to establish a visual explanation for Peter's head being chopped off by that piece of lighting equipment that came loose and plummeted to the ground," said executive producer David Benioff, scrambling to set up a shot with a character wielding a bloody axe to justify why Dinklage was headless on the floor. "Come on, people, we don't have much time here. Let's get some makeup on Peter's face to fix that discolored skin. Clean up that blood, but save it, don't throw it out, that stuff looks pretty realistic on camera. Alright, tape Peter's head back on and let's nail this scene." At press time, the producers were thrilled after the hyper-realistic final beheading scene turned out even better than what was originally in the script.

'The Onion' Launches New Cover-Up Desk To Suppress Today's Most Damning Stories
As many controversial stories have recently demonstrated, journalists play a significant role in determining how a news item is reported, as well as which narratives make it to light. The nature of social media and the rise in leakers and whistleblowers present new challenges for traditional reportage. They also offer exciting new opportunities for intrepid investigative reporters. To meet these challenges, The Onion is launching a new cover-up desk to suppress today's most damning stories. Countless reporters, anonymous sources, and leakers work to expose illegal or unethical activity, often over the objection of their more powerful bosses. This is a disgrace to journalism and absolutely cannot continue. As consummate professionals, we are disturbed by investigations into politicians, industry leaders, and other wealthy people, many of whom are too busy or have committed too many misdeeds to prevent every bit of damaging information from coming out. All too often, dogged efforts by media executives and their powerful friends to bury information or kill stories are undermined by disobedient journalists who can't leave well enough alone. Our agile new cover-up desk will allow us to stop at nothing to ensure negative press never sees the light of day. For our new venture, we've assembled an industry-leading team of reporters we lured from ABC News, NBC News, the Washington Post, and elsewhere, who boast combined decades of self-censorship and ignoring substantive evidence about topics from financial malfeasance to sexual misconduct to government wrongdoing. From our new $50 million offices in Washington, D.C., New York, and San Francisco, they will do the hard work of following every lead and probing every dark corner to collect as much information as possible about accusers and sow doubt about their motivations and character. They will also be available for television appearances as experts, where they can repeat approved talking points about a controversial issue or figure until no one watching would believe anything to the contrary. As a journalistic standard bearer, The Onion has long been a champion of suppressing damaging stories about powerful people. What our cover-up desk now enables us to do is take our efforts at concealment into the 21st century. Not only will we be on the ground tampering with evidence and destroying any compromising documents that fall into our hands, we'll also have a 24-hour secure tip line for anyone with information about a negative story that could become public. Using these methods, our reporters will be on the front lines of ruining investigations, obliterating incriminating documents, and threatening victims into silence forever. While we face stiff competition within the news industry to stifle transparency and accountability, we at The Onion are positive that we'll be capable of covering up stories that other organizations would never dream of.

George R.R. Martin Promises Fans 'The Winds Of Winter' Is Nearly Started
SANTA FE, NM — Stoking readers' anticipation about the long-awaited Game Of Thrones sequel, best-selling author George R.R. Martin promised fans Thursday that his upcoming novel The Winds Of Winter was nearly started. "I wanted to let everyone know that I'm sitting at my desk with a nice cup of tea, I've got a Word document open, and I'm just about ready to go," Martin wrote in a blog post on his website, assuring readers that as soon as he cleared off his desk and threw a load of laundry into the dryer, he could pretty much begin. "I don't want to get anyone's hopes up, but at this point, I've basically already brainstormed a couple of character names and written part of an outline for chapter one. After that, it shouldn't take more than another three or four weeks until I'm ready to check a few emails, grab some groceries, and put the very earliest touches on the manuscript. Can't wait!" At press time, the author had been forced to return to square one after realizing he needed a better title than The Winds Of Winter.

"Hang on, birdies, dinner's coming! Out of my way, cocksuckers!" At press time, Hanson was doing 30 miles above the speed limit but had no intention of stopping for the police car in her rearview mirror.

"Look, Barry, you need to keep your head in the game up there, and you sure as shit can't focus if you've got a full load flaring up inside you," said Biden, telling Obama he should feel free to think about the first lady, "Jill [Biden], or whoever pops into your head while you're polishing the ol' Capitol dome." "Hell, I must've yanked the crank a good eight or nine times before my debate with Sarah Palin back in '08…and a few times after, too, if you catch my drift." At press time, sources reported seeing the president enter a private bathroom with Biden's "rare and always reliable" January 1979 edition of Playboy.

Kay Jewelers Recalls 2 Million Cursed Wedding Rings
AKRON, OH — Apologizing to customers for "any discomfort or searing of the flesh" on their ring fingers, Kay Jewelers ordered a recall Thursday of some two million cursed wedding bands sold at its 900 locations nationwide over the past several years. "We announce with great regret that a considerable portion of our inventory, mostly from the Leo Diamond and Neil Lane Bridal lines, became cursed by an ancient evil either within the mine or at some point during the casting process," company executive Judith Stelling said, responding to widespread reports of agonizing night terrors and chronic infertility among Kay patrons. "If any wearer of Kay products has experienced partial or total blindness, nausea, intense rage upon entering a church, or has suffered a string of unexplained family tragedies, you may return the defective item to any Kay-affiliated retailer to be destroyed by a qualified priest." Stelling added that anyone who returns a cursed ring would receive full store credit and a complimentary silver pendant from Jane Seymour's Open Hearts collection.

'New Day, Same Bullshit,' Whispers Dalai Lama Before Slapping On Smile To Greet The Masses
MCLEOD GANJ, INDIA — Gripping the rim of the sink while staring at his reflection in his bathroom mirror, the Dalai Lama reportedly whispered, "New day, same bullshit," Friday before slapping on a smile to go greet the masses. "If one more person asks me for spiritual guidance in the face of adversity, I'm going to blow my fucking brains out," said the 14th Dalai Llama, sighing while checking his watch and reminding himself that he only needed to get through eight hours of congregating with throngs of devoted followers before he could return home to crash in front of the TV for the rest of the night. "It's always something with these people. One of these days, some poor schmuck is gonna tell me how much I inspire him and I'll snap. I'll just start screaming and never stop. Pull it together, Tenzin, people are counting on you for spiritual leadership or whatever. God, I'm exhausted." At press time, the Dalai Lama was laughing while discussing the beauty of divine benevolence in an interview with BBC News.

Doctor Informs Woman He's Overweight
HOUSTON — Hoping to communicate the numerous health risks that can stem from obesity, local doctor Peter Gerheart took time during an annual checkup to gently inform patient Brianna Torres that he is overweight, sources reported Friday. "This is never an easy thing to tell a patient, but I think it's important to be transparent about this — I am overweight," said the primary care physician, who explained that his family history of obesity may have contributed to his current weight and went on to reference a series of charts outlining how his body mass index and high blood pressure put him at greater risk for heart disease. "I don't want to stigmatize or shame myself here, but I do want you to know how important it is for me to make some changes to my lifestyle. Even moderate exercise and a slightly more varied diet could have a major impact on my health, and if I don't make these changes now, I could face some serious issues down the road. So when I see you for your next checkup, I'd like to see myself a little slimmer." According to reports, Gerheart went on to show Torres a list of healthy snack options he could eat in order to break his junk food habit.

Rowdy Grandma Double-Fisting Grandchildren
VALDOSTA, GA — Urging the feisty senior to pace herself, concerned Jackson family sources confirmed Wednesday that rowdy grandmother Arlene Jackson was seen careening around her son-in-law's birthday party double-fisting grandchildren. "Nana's got her arms so full of grandbabies that she's practically falling over — she needs to slow down," said Jackson's daughter Olivia, echoing the sentiments of other adult party guests as they witnessed the manic 77-year-old cover her infant grandson with kisses before moving on to pinch the cheeks of four other grandchildren. "She already had both of my nieces on her lap when she snatched baby Charlie out of my hands. We told her to take it easy, but she stamped over and loud-whispered that she knows her limits. I mean, other people want to see the kids, too, but Arlene is just not handing them over." Jackson was later seen slumped over in a recliner with several toddlers strewn about her feet, evidently passed out after several hours of binge-kissing.

The Hardest Boss Battles Of All Time
There's nothing like triumphing over a nigh-unbeatable boss, and no amount of screaming or controller throwing can convince us otherwise. But a few boss battles rise above the pack as truly unforgettable gaming experiences. Here is OGN's definitive list of the the hardest boss battles of all time. This one-of-a-kind final Pokémon is notorious for disarming opponents with its pure sexual magnetism, forcing even the most skilled trainers to wonder if they should just throw it all away for one crazy weekend of passion. This gas-mask-wearing mindreader is literally impossible to beat until you figure out you just have to unplug your controller, eject the game, break it over your knee, and never think about one of these bloated examples of Hideo Kojima's exhausting creative vision again. Modeled after the real-life Mike Tyson in every way, whenever you have this character on the ropes, he simply declares bankruptcy to get out of trouble. While on the surface Master Hand appears to be just any old disembodied hand, it's actually an identical replica of the hands of one of the greatest combat artists of our time, Jackie Chan, thus making this battle a tough one to win. Even the most battle-hardened hunters find themselves disarmed by the quiet dignity behind this monster's eyes, the undeniable spark of soul that makes you stop and ask why its life should be considered any less meaningful than your own. This provides just the opening Rajang needs to seamlessly combo into its one-shot lightning beam attack and obliterate your character. Grabbing Bowser by the tail and spinning him around may seem like an easy task, but it's made all the more difficult by Mario's hands being covered in bacon grease. Unfortunately, eating bacon is the only way to restore health in this game, meaning Bowser will likely slip from your grasp over and over again. It's been 35 years since its release, and still no one has found a way to kill this awful little man. Anyone who's played this skateboarding classic remembers its soul-crushing finale, in which your mom steps in the room and asks you to pause the game so that you can talk about something important before bringing you into the kitchen to meet your new stepdad.

Biden Scores 800 Feet Of Copper Wire
WASHINGTON — Calling it a "major-ass haul" that would provide "some much-needed scratch," Vice President Joe Biden reportedly scored over 800 feet of copper wire from a foreclosed home in the D.C. suburbs, White House sources confirmed Thursday. Biden, who is admittedly "flat fucking broke" from throwing numerous "ragin' keggers" over the last nine months, recently devised the plan to strip copper wiring around the Washington, D.C. area after hearing that there was a thriving black market for the ductile metal. "There's tons of dough in copper wire if you've got the know-how," the vice president was overheard telling a White House official, explaining that he learned the hard way that swiping manhole covers wasn't worth the hassle. "As Lady Luck always says, moving copper ain't easy. But if you play the metal game right, you're looking at something like a two- to three-grand payday for a night's worth of work." "At this point, I'm just looking for a dealer who won't dick me over," Biden added. "It's tough finding a trustworthy metal theft ring. Some of the guys in this biz can be real pieces of shit." While tearing down the walls of a vacated residence in Reston, VA earlier this week, the former six-term Delaware senator was reportedly stoked to discover a "goddamn goldmine" of "pure coil" after smashing a hole in the masonry barrier with a sledgehammer. "When we were breaking into the basement window, I told my buddy Blaze that I had a damn good feeling about the joint," Biden reportedly informed several colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "One second, me and Blaze are covered in plaster dust from busting holes in drywall, and the next thing I know we're celebrating our killer score of primo copper with a couple 40s of King Cobra." According to aides familiar with the vice president's illicit activity, Biden and his partner Blaze have had marginal success stripping copper from buildings around the Capitol, often breaking into strip malls and construction sites at night to "gank" wire from the walls. During one robbery the veteran politician had dubbed "Operation Diablo," the vice president and Blaze waited until Congress went on a five-week hiatus before "hitting up" the Library of Congress, which Biden had observed "has a shit-ton of copper." Biden reportedly struggled to sell the copper wire stolen from the Library of Congress, blaming a series of critical setbacks that included a doomed alliance with Blaze's "hothead" cousin Derek who ruined several "juicy" deals by making enemies at numerous scrap yards. "Had a real tough time unloading it last time," said Biden, referring to a "sketchy" deal in which negotiations broke down with a buyer at a Washington recycling plant. "Sure, sometimes Diamond Joe goes barking up the wrong tree. This one ballbuster tried to jerk me out of 300 smackers. Truth be told, a lot of these cheap bastards wouldn't know a deal on quality wire if it was stomping on their nuts." "Almost sold some scrap metal to [House Minority Leader John] Boehner, though," Biden added. "He didn't bite, but I got a pretty good feeling I got him in the bag for next time around." Sources confirmed that until Biden can determine a more viable course of action, the vice president plans to stow his latest copper score in a rented storage unit outside Bethesda, which also houses his collection of vintage stag films and tanto knives. Biden also announced plans to scale back operations with Blaze, who the 70-year-old public servant increasingly believes will double-cross him. "Blaze can no longer be trusted," said the vice president while covering copper tubing with a tarp, noting that Blaze's plan to strip coil from the vice presidential residence during his first term left him without power for six weeks. "He wants to keep it in his shed, but I said no can do." "One minute we're stripping grade-A orange from the National Museum of History, and the next, Blaze is hopping the border to Tennessee with [Secretary of Transportation] Ray [LaHood] and a truck full of my wire," Biden added. "From now on, Joe flips coil solo." At press time, Biden was reportedly encouraging President Barack Obama to get in on the action.

Conor McGregor Credits Excellent Pre-Fight Shape To Routine Of Hurling Heavy Objects In Public Spaces
LAS VEGAS — Explaining how constantly throwing bar stools strengthens several different muscle groups, mixed martial artist Conor McGregor credited his excellent pre-fight shape Saturday to a rigorous workout routine of hurling heavy objects in public spaces. "I've never been one for the gym — I need to be out there overturning tables and tossing them across the bar," said the former welterweight champion, revealing that he trained for his main event bout against Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone by adhering to a strict regimen of ripping parking meters out of the ground and using them to pelt fleeing taxis. "I like to stay loose by getting into a scrum at the pub every week. Throwing hundreds of beer bottles is just good cardio. When I'm ready for strength training, I'll knock over some mailboxes and chuck them into the park. Lifting cinder blocks above my head to smash in the windshield of my girlfriend's car is great, too." At press time, McGregor hurled a scale into an audience of reporters and broke one bystander's jaw after weighing in two pounds over his ideal weight.

Parents Sign Up Mitch Trubisky For Rec Soccer Team In Hopes He'll Develop Interest In Sports
MENTOR, OH — Figuring that, at worst, it would be a good way to get him outside, parents of Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky confirmed Thursday that they had signed their son up for a community rec soccer team to see if it would spark any sort of interest in sports for him. "We've had a hard time over the last few years trying to get Mitch excited about athletics, but sometimes kids need a little push on these things," said father Dave, admitting that he had assumed that the dedication to sports displayed by all of Trubisky's friends would have rubbed off on him, but that his son still seemed disinterested and mentally somewhere else when everyone around him was competing. "We just think it's important for a boy his age to be running around, getting fresh air and exercise. I was telling Jeanne that if this doesn't take, we can try baseball, or there's a summer swim league he might like, too. I think he would have a real aptitude for this stuff if he just applied himself. And who knows, he might even have a little fun." At press time, Mitch Trubisky was being carried off the field crying after getting hit in the face by a ball five minutes into the game.

Aaron Rodgers Pledges To Dedicate Off-Season To Growing As Brand Ambassador
MALIBU, CA — Promising that he wouldn't let outside distractions interfere like in the past, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers pledged Wednesday to dedicate his off-season to growing as a brand ambassador. "You know, we went far pretty this season, but we ultimately fell short of our sales goal and some of that falls on my shoulders," said Rodgers, referring to Payton Manning as the model for a pitchman who got even better in the back half of his career. "Every member of this crew puts in so much work, so I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror if I didn't give it my all out there. I'm working with an acting coach just to stay sharp, and I've already reached out to [Patrick] Mahomes to run some lines. I owe it to all the fans out there to hit my cues and deliver catchphrases at a high level." Rodgers concluded his interview by promising to bring the State Farm crew to at least one more Super Bowl commercial.

Patriots Claim Unsanctioned Recording Was Only For Project Julian Edelman Working On For Filmmaking Class
FOXBOROUGH, MA — Defending the video as absolutely necessary for the wide receiver to secure at least a 'B' from Massasoit Community College, Patriots officials claimed Friday that their unsanctioned recording of the Bengals sideline last week was only for a project Julian Edelman was working on for a film class. "Julian has just gotten really into cinema the last few years, and he's trying to branch out from football with some experimental films," said owner Robert Kraft, who dismissed accusations that the Patriots were trying to steal signals for their upcoming game by explaining that Edelman wanted the cameras hidden in the stands to mimic the zoomed-out, wide-angle shots used by some of his biggest directorial influences. "It's been so great to see Julian come alive while taking this class, and it upsets me seeing the media and other NFL teams using this as a flimsy pretense to accuse us of cheating. We're just trying to enrich the lives of our players by letting them grow as people off the field, and Julian thought covertly filming the Cincinnati sidelines was a great idea for a short film. His professor apparently thinks he has real talent and told him he should submit his stuff to some local film festivals." At press time, the NFL had dismissed all charges against the Patriots after Kraft donated $10 million towards the creation of an NFL film scholarship program for the league's players.

Cubs Sign Sammy Sosa To $300 Million Deal Just To Give Casual Fans Point Of Reference
CHICAGO — Extending an olive branch to fans who stopped following the game in the 1990s, the Chicago Cubs reportedly signed right fielder Sammy Sosa to a 12-year, $300 million contract Friday. "We're excited to give casual fans a recognizable name that they can cling to," said general manager Jed Hoyer in reference to the 51-year-old, clarifying that they hoped to extend his contract well into the 2050s "if things go according to plan," and adding that the slugger was in far better shape than fellow outfielder Kyle Schwarber. "We recognize that our current core of Anthony Rizzo, Jon Lester, and Javier Baez just doesn't move the needle for most fans, so we wanted to make a big splash this offseason. We considered signing Mark McGuire and Randy Johnson, but Sammy's brand recognition really won out for us. Plus, he's already played for the Cubs." At press time, Hoyer revealed the team was cutting costs by parting ways with Wrigley Field.

Real-Life 'Katamari'! This Drunk Driver Is Still Dragging The Cyclist He Hit
Calling all Katamari Damacy fans — you're going to love this! If you were into this Namco classic, you'll definitely be excited to hear Keita Takahashi's off-the-wall classic pretty much came to life moments ago when a drunk driver ran over a bike messenger who got tangled in the bumper and is still being dragged by the car as we speak! Watching the visibly intoxicated driver weave his way through traffic with the badly bloodied cyclist trailing behind is sure to give any PlayStation 2 owner some serious flashbacks to rolling around the Prince's katamari in the 2004 cel-shaded classic to collect cows, thumbtacks, takoyaki, forks, and any other quirky object you could find. And just like in the game, this wildly swerving driver is picking up all sorts of items as he runs them over! There's some litter that got caught in his hubcaps from when he drove on the sidewalk. There's blood on his windshield. And check it out! He just picked up a bunch of newspapers when he tried to jump the curb to flee the scene! Look out, everyone! If this guy keeps it up, pretty soon he's probably going to be bigger than the earth itself! In fact, we here at OGN are getting hit by a tidal wave of nostalgia just watching the driver ricochet off an alley wall plowing down a one-way side street. Katamari's controls were definitely pretty clunky, and we can't tell you the number of times we got stuck in a tight corner and needed to use all our wits to keep our ball moving. Plus, if that screaming, heavily wounded cyclist is a Katamari fan, there's no doubt he's excited to be part of this incredible recreation! Frankly, we hope this die-hard gamer never stops drunk driving in his mission to breathe fresh life into the hallowed legacy of Katamari Damacy. If the police finally catch up to him, though, he can tell everyone in prison about the day he gathered a haul that would make even the King Of All Cosmos proud. Congrats to this true Katamari champ! Way to go!

Russian Olympic Program Denies Steroids Played Role In 8-Year-Old Gymnast Hurling Balance Beam Through Wall To Escape
MOSCOW — Issuing an adamant rejection of any wrongdoing in the wake of a four-year ban from global sports, top Russian sporting officials denied Monday that steroids had enabled 8-year-gymnast Svetlana Larionova to hurl a balance beam through a concrete wall and escape a state-run athletics facility. "Anna just happens to be a particularly gifted young athlete — performance-enhancing supplements played no part in her snapping the necks of three guards and then aerial-cartwheeling over a 15-foot barbed-wire fence," said national gymnastics team spokesperson Dasha Zechory, explaining that the steel-reinforced wall Larionova shattered to pieces was "probably laid on a shoddy foundation," and that a lot of kids her age could lift a 600-pound balance beam if they felt a rush of adrenaline. "While her whereabouts are presently unknown, we trust she will resume her training as soon as she realizes the horrible mistake she has made in turning her back on Russian gymnastics. We urge anyone who encounters Anna to exercise extreme caution, stay very far out of her way, and contact authorities immediately." At press time, Larionova's trainer had issued a heartfelt plea for the girl to return and forgiven her for punching a hole through the middle of his chest.

'I'm Just Here For The Commercials,' Jokes Man At Super Bowl Party Too Embarrassed To Admit He Desperate For Any Human Company
MECHANICSBURG, PA — Grabbing a beer and telling other party-goers that football is not really his thing, local man Walt Madison told partygoers Sunday that he was just here for the commercials instead of admitting that he had been desperate for any human company whatsoever. "I'm not super into sports, so it's really more about the food and commercials for me," said Madison, who has been crippled by a sense of endless loneliness ever since his ex-girlfriend moved out of their apartment last year. "Personally, I'm more excited about the halftime show than anything that happens on the field [and actually spending more than five minutes with a living breathing human being]. This is really just an excuse for me to make my famous buffalo artichoke dip and have a few laughs." At press time, party sources confirmed they were all wishing that asshole Madison would just leave after he referred to the game-winning touchdown as "a goal ball."

Sad: The Elderly Dutch Man Who Inspired The 'X' Button On The PlayStation Controller Has Passed Away
Gamers, it's time to pay our respects. Industry luminaries and fans across the world are coming together today to mourn the passing of a legendary figure in video game history. Johann De Vries, the man who inspired the 'X' button on the PlayStation controller, died peacefully at his home in Rotterdam this morning at the age of 96. True gamers are no doubt familiar with Johann's epic story, which began in the woods of Veluwezoom in the Netherlands. It was here that, as a child, Johann was mauled by a charging boar, a confrontation that left him with two vicious red scars on his face striking through each other diagonally. Talk about a stroke of luck! After this incident, Johann seemed destined to live an average life, and so he did until November of 1994, when he took one life-changing family vacation to Japan. A lover of modern architecture, Johann was touring Tokyo and happened to pass by the Sony Entertainment Headquarters. Little did Johann know but inside that very building was a team of engineers who had been struggling for weeks to complete a controller for their new gaming systems. The team had made big strides after coming up with a "∆" button, but now they were hitting a wall. As they stared out the window, desperate for an idea, they saw the perfect answer to their problem right on a Dutch man's face. While initially horrified by his visage, the PlayStation developers were also struck by its elegant simplicity. PlayStation security guards quickly separated Johann from his family and ushered him inside, where, for the next three weeks, dozens of artists and designers would work 12-hour days to perfectly render the shape of his face. After finally matching the dimensions to De Vries's perfectly circular face, the 'X' button was born. ..and the rest is video game history! While we're sad to hear that such an important man in our community is no longer with us, it's inspiring to remember everything he did for such an iconic piece of gaming history. So, come on gamers! The next time you jump, duck, or even button-smash to heavy-attack, take a moment and think of Johann. Godspeed, sir!

Queen Elizabeth Rushed To Hospital For Royal Blood Transfusion
LONDON — Saying that Her Highness was now in stable condition, Buckingham Palace representatives announced Thursday that Queen Elizabeth II had been rushed to the hospital early this morning to receive an emergency transfusion of royal blood. "It was a dire situation — there was very little royal blood on hand owing to the relatively small number of donations made by the noble-born," said Private Secretary to the Sovereign Sir Christopher Geidt, adding that Prince William ultimately donated the blood of royal descent that saved the queen's life. "Unfortunately, Prince Harry was not a match for Her Majesty, and Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton was of no use, being of common parentage." Geidt went on to say that in the event Queen Elizabeth required another transfusion, three-year-old Prince George would remain readily available to donate as much as was needed.

New Patriotic Gatorade Ad Shows Terrorists Being Waterboarded With Gatorade
CHICAGO — Blaring the national anthem as soldiers stood holding red, white, and blue sports drinks, a new patriotic Gatorade ad that aired Friday showed terrorists being waterboarded with Gatorade. "Gatorade is the official drink of protecting the American homeland," said Gatorade spokesperson Ally Hawthorne about the spot, which showed several Middle Eastern men strapped to boards with sheets over their heads while various interrogators dumped thirst-quenching, 5-gallon coolers of Gatorade over their faces. "With our enhanced hydration techniques, Gatorade is ensuring that the United States remains not just safe but electrolyte-fueled, just like our forefathers intended. That's why when someone asks 'Is it in you? ,' the answer is always 'yes.'" At press time, Gatorade had come under fire for a television ad that showed Osama bin Laden being brought back to life and tortured after being given a Gatorade Recovery Shake.

Fisher-Price Recalls Dangerous 30-Foot-Tall High Chair
EAST AURORA, NY — Apologizing to customers for mistakenly boosting their children far past the height of the average kitchen table, Fisher-Price officials announced Thursday that they had recalled thousands of dangerous 30-foot-tall high chairs. "After a thorough investigation, we have determined that the risk of a toddler wiggling out and immediately falling three stories to the ground is simply too great," said Fisher-Price CEO Ynon Kreiz, adding that although the 4-in-1 Total Clean Sky Chair had various safety features, including a toddler-catching net below, it simply wasn't enough. "We understand that many of the problems were inherent to our design, and we sincerely apologize to anyone whose toddler somehow unbuckled their harness and fatally plunged 10 yards to the floor, as well as parents who fell off the high chair after attempting to climb up and feed their children. We are happy to offer a $100 refund to anyone who suffered a severed limb while trying to collapse the chair to its lowest height of 25 feet." At press time, Fisher-Price had also issued a recall on their SUV-sized Laugh & Learn Smart Cars after several models ran over parents and crushed them to death.

Hardcore Weezer Fan Hates Everything Band Has Released Since Forming
OAKLAND, CA — Stressing that the band had gone downhill since the days they came into existence, hardcore Weezer fan Nathan Staples told reporters Friday that he has hated everything the band released since their formation in 1992. "Yeah, frankly, I think they stopped being good right around the self-titled debut, and everything since then has just gotten progressively worse," said the self-described Weezer diehard, adding that he sincerely missed the "old Weezer" from before Scott Shriner, Patrick Wilson, Brian Bell, and Rivers Cuomo joined the band. "Obviously, I love these guys, but I remember seeing the 'Buddy Holly' video back in the early nineties and realizing, 'Man, these guys suck now.' And then Pinkerton really hammered home that they were never coming back. At this point, they've released, like, 13 bad albums in a row and I barely remember why I liked them in the first place." Staples also noted that he still thought Rivers Cuomo's time as a middle school student without musical training held up as strongly as ever.

Modern-Day Rudy Fulfills Dream Of Showering With Notre Dame Football Team
NOTRE DAME, IN — Welling up with emotion upon finally setting foot on the hallowed tile surface, college senior Anthony Harper fulfilled his lifelong dream Saturday after finally being allowed to shower with the Notre Dame football team. "A lot of people told me I would never make it into these showers, but I knew that if I worked hard and never quit, I have what it takes to strip down and lather up with Notre Dame football," said Harper, who received an ovation from the team after coach Brian Kelly tossed him some conditioner and told him to "get on in there." "Every week for the last three years, I would sit on the bench in this locker room and watch the team shower, wishing I could be in there with them. I always thought I was too small to soap up with Notre Dame, but it just goes to show that with enough grit and determination, anyone can achieve their lifelong dream to bathe with a college football team." Harper added that finally getting to shower with Notre Dame was made even more special by having his entire family there to witness it.

SCHAUMBURG, IL — Noting that the little fucker must be in some seriously deep shit to be booking it like that, local man Albert Chu told reporters Friday that the centipede tearing ass across his floor must be really late for something. "I dunno if he slept through a meeting or if he forgot to pick up his centipede kids or whatever, but those hundred legs of his were straight-up motoring," said Chu, adding that just a few minutes earlier, he had watched the Scutigera coleoptrata burst out of a crack in the shower grout and immediately start sprinting towards a gap below the bathroom door. "While I'm not totally sure where that little guy was going, at one point he was hauling ass so hard that he straight up ate it and fell three feet off the side of the raised bathroom tub. Oh, God. I hope he didn't get fired." At press time, Chu said he hoped whoever the centipede was meeting wouldn't be too mad that he had crushed the insect beneath his foot and flushed it down the toilet.

FBI Warns 'Downton Abbey' Screenings Could Be Target For Shootings By Disgruntled Royalist
WASHINGTON — Following reports of disturbing behavior by disaffected loners at the fringes of high society, the FBI released a joint intelligence bulletin Thursday warning moviegoers that screenings of the film Downton Abbey could be a potential target for shootings by disgruntled royalists. "The individuals in question are in a state of constant anger and dissatisfaction, frustrated to be living in a world that does not honor the crown," read the bulletin in part, outlining how the FBI had discovered the plots while monitoring pro-monarchy dark-web forums where members posted about how seeing people like themselves onscreen who believed in divine right had inspired them to restore power to the throne through violence. "We fear that the themes of largesse and elitism depicted in this film may radicalize these people. While the FBI intends to deploy a select amount of undercover police officers dressed as servants to screenings, we advise theater employees and attendees alike to keep an eye out for suspiciously fancy activity by individuals in tails or top hats. We advise extreme caution if the theater patrons encounter anyone who looks like a member of the landed gentry." At press time, AMC and Regal Cinemas announced that security personnel would be posted at all upcoming Downton Abbey screenings to check bags for dueling pistols.

Super Bowl LIII: Key Storylines To Watch
Super Bowl LIII will pit AFC champion New England Patriots against NFC champion Los Angeles Rams to determine whether Patriots fans can find it within themselves to get even more fucking obnoxious. The Onion takes a look at the key storylines for each team leading up to the big game. After the duo's many years together, critics are wondering whether there's enough left in the tank for one more Super Bowl win for defensive line coach Brendan Daly and defensive end Malcom Brown. McVay is the youngest head coach in NFL history, and if he wins, he will celebrate by kissing a girl on the lips for the first time. A victory would go a long way toward making L.A. residents aware that the team moved back from St. Louis in 2016. The outcome could hinge on whether Belichick's game plan is able to fully exploit all the referees' weaknesses. This is totally an option that night as well. Not playing in this game, but they really should keep a camera on that guy at all times. This game should finally settle the longstanding debate over whether Tom Brady is good at playing football or bad at playing football. Rams fans should be encouraged by the Patriots' struggles against middling quarterbacks in the Super Bowl. The Rams are hoping their running back shows up big and brings his famous Buffalo chicken dip. Would like to remind everyone that this is bullshit.

Gynecologists Recommend Taking Time Off Between IUDs To Allow Body To Expel Backlogged Periods
ROCHESTER, MN — In an effort to promote optimal women's health, gynecologists at the Mayo Clinic recommended Thursday taking time off between IUDs to allow the body to expel backlogged periods. "We advise that before inserting a new Mirena or Liletta, a woman should give her body a break to flush out the months upon months of blood and mucosal tissue that have been steadily building up inside her," said Dr. Nancy Windus, noting that after the removal of the old intrauterine device, a woman's body naturally begins to slough off the roughly five dozen uterine linings festering within her. "Allowing all that stagnant blood to release is essential to gynecological health and gives the uterus a chance to recover from the approximately 60 menstruations it's been waiting to discharge. Furthermore, it's always better to begin a new birth control regimen with a fresh, unclogged endometrium." Gynecologists also confirmed that while IUDs are highly effective, in rare circumstances, it is possible for all five years worth of accumulated eggs to become fertilized.

25-Year-Old Moving Into Comfortable, Rent-Free Arrangement In Parents' Home Worried He's Hit Rock Bottom
CLEVELAND — Speculating that he had quite possibly reached the lowest point in his life thus far, 25-year-old Jeremy Garcia admitted he was worried he had hit rock bottom Wednesday after moving into a comfortable, rent-free arrangement in his parents' house. "I'm deeply ashamed. ..I have no idea how I let things get this bad," said Garcia, who is not addicted to intravenous drugs, struggling with a gambling problem, or involved in criminal activity, but merely "needed some time to regroup" after graduating from college, which his parents paid for in full. "I could be hanging out with my friends right now, but instead, I'm stuck here, eating the dinner my mom cooks and pays for every night. I mean, at least there's no way it could possibly get any worse." At press time, Garcia had retreated to his clean, well-lighted room to brood after his parents reassured him that it was his home, too, and he could stay there as long as he wanted.

Recently Discovered 13,000-Year-Old Footprints Reveal Humans Danced The Charleston Earlier Than First Thought
CALVERT ISLAND, BRITISH COLUMBIA — In a discovery that defies all current theories concerning when developing humans began to kick up their heels, researchers confirmed Tuesday that a recently discovered set of distinctively patterned footprints found preserved in 13,000-year-old Canadian mud may reveal humans danced the Charleston much earlier than first thought. "Before now, we had only been able to trace the Charleston back to a few years before its heyday in the 1920s, but with this new evidence, we can confidently posit that early humans were performing a rudimentary Lindy hop-style step with their best gals as early as the Mesolithic age," said University of Victoria anthropologist Allison Iao, who emphasized that the footprints' repeating pressure and spacing patterns clearly indicated early humans' surprisingly sophisticated knowledge of alternating rearward toe-taps and, in some cases, even shimmies, dips, and spins. "While it's true that these humans were performing a somewhat primitive version of the moves we know today — their jazz was probably not hot enough to really 'swing' as we know it — this breakthrough leaves no question that early humans were hooting, hollering, and cutting a rug long before the birth of what archaeologists heretofore considered the first jazz baby." Iao later confirmed that this development is the most significant of its kind since the 1987 discovery of a sequential series of footprints in the igneous rock of Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano provided evidence of mankind's earliest known conga line.

Study: Coffee Drinkers At Far Higher Risk Of Having Mug Crash To Floor In Slow Motion After Hearing Their Father Is Dead
BERKELEY, CA — In a new study that explores the potentially traumatic effects of habitual caffeine consumption when combined with life-altering news, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley confirmed Tuesday that coffee drinkers are at a dramatically increased risk of having their mugs crash to the floor in slow motion upon hearing their father has died. "We've found significant evidence that drinking even one cup of coffee daily exposes you to increased risk of your mug slowly falling from your suddenly lifeless grasp in the moments after you learn of your father's untimely passing — whether from a tearful family member, a kind-faced police officer at your doorstep, or a local TV anchor narrating over footage of your dad's car being pulled from the water," said lead researcher Marie Romero, who noted the plunging mug is part of a list of symptoms that includes everything going silent as the mouth slowly forms the word "nooooo." "Our research indicates that coffee drinkers are the most likely to be overwhelmed by memories of their father as their mugs shatter, forgotten, at their feet, spreading coffee across the white tile, a heartrending reminder of the fragility of life and the suddenness with which everything can change forever." The study also found that tea drinkers have a genetic predisposition to react to their fathers' sudden passing by slowly placing their cup back in the saucer, politely thanking the bearer of the dreadful news, showing them out of the study, and quietly but firmly shutting the door.

Teen On Birthright Trip Hadn't Expected To See So Many Dead Palestinians
JERUSALEM — Saying they were pretty hard to miss during her two-week visit to Israel, teenager Sarah Caplan told reporters Monday that she hadn't expected to see so many dead Palestinians on her Birthright trip. "My friend Kate who came over last year said she noticed a couple, but this is way more dead Palestinians than I ever imagined," said Caplan, who explained that her tour group was prepared to see a few scattered bodies while driving around the country, but were completely caught off guard when they stumbled on entire groups of dead Palestinians near the Gaza border. "It was cool to see the Western Wall, and we all got to ride camels in the desert, but we still saw a couple bodies there, too. At first you think it's just this one-time thing and you don't worry about it, but pretty soon, you realize they are kind of everywhere. They didn't really mention anything about this during the orientation." Caplan was also surprised that there were so many people her age in the Israeli Defense Forces killing Palestinians.

Mariners' Staff Tired Of Ichiro Suzuki's Long Warm-Up Routine Before Using Scanner
SEATTLE — Groaning and rolling their eyes as the front office executive methodically stretched different muscle groups, the Mariners' staff expressed frustration Wednesday at new coworker Ichiro Suzuki's long warm-up routine before using the office scanner. "It's ridiculous. He does all these breathing techniques to improve his concentration before he pulls out his damn documents," said ticket sales rep Richard Pasch, who claimed he was forced to stand and wait for more than five minutes as Suzuki opened and closed the document cover over and over again. "He does it every time he goes up there, swinging the papers around his head and then jumping up and down, pumping his knees and tapping the email button — how is that supposed to help? I don't care if he thinks flipping the document over exactly 100 times helps him scan, other people have work to do." At press time, the coworkers were complaining that Suzuki's constant stepping out of the boardroom had extended the average meeting time to over four hours.

Ecuadorian Embassy Runs Ad Seeking 'No Drama' Tenant For Newly Vacant Room
LONDON — In an effort to find an occupant who doesn't "bring the party home," officials at the Ecuadorian embassy in London ran an ad Thursday on several local flat-sharing websites seeking a "no drama" tenant for a newly vacant room. "We're looking for someone who can get along with a diverse group of foreign government dignitaries," read the ad in part, noting that the ideal roommate to fill the vacancy in the spacious multi-story home located in the quiet Kensington neighborhood would keep regular hours and not spend all their time in the apartment. "You must have a steady job and pay rent on time — this is non-negotiable due to past issues we've had. Guests are okay, but if you're constantly having over girlfriends, boyfriends, journalists, or activists, this is not the place for you." The ad requested that all interested parties attend the embassy's Saturday open house and be prepared with at least two past-roommate references and a security deposit of two months' rent.

'Holy Shit, The Government Owes Me 50 Million Dollars,' Reports Man Incorrectly Filling Out His Taxes
CINCINNATI — Excited by the prospect of quitting his retail job and moving to his own South Pacific island, 28-year-old Ben Hughes learned Friday that he would be receiving $50 million in returns from the federal government after incorrectly filling out his taxes. "Wait, let me double-check this — yep, 50 million dollars, it's all right here," said Hughes, referring to a virtually illegible tax form on which he clearly entered his zip-code in the space intended for his number of dependents, deducted his social security number from his withholding, and had somehow managed to follow the tax reporting procedure for a major military contracting business. "Wow! I didn't think the benefits from the new tax laws kicked in until next year, but I guess this must be making up for all those years when I got nothing back at all." At press time, Hughes' enthusiasm was dampened somewhat upon finding that he actually owed the state of Ohio $17 million in property taxes.

Exhausted Bill Belichick Attempts To Wake Up By Splashing Some Blood On His Face
HINGHAM, MA — After getting out of bed and trudging into his bathroom early Monday morning, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick reportedly attempted to wake himself up by splashing some blood on his face. "I'm usually pretty groggy in the morning, so this is a good way to get energized," said Belichick as he cupped some cold blood in his hands, tossed it onto his face several times in quick succession, and rubbed some blood in his eyes before drying off with a washcloth. "I always feel so much better afterwards — refreshed and ready to start my day. It wakes me up right away, which is great when I don't have time for my usual hot blood shower in the morning." Reports later confirmed that after getting dressed and putting on his shoes, Belichick realized he was late for work and quickly filled a travel mug with some steaming hot blood before rushing out the door.

William Barr Declares Mueller Investigation Fully Exonerates Members Of Reagan Administration From Iran-Contra Involvement
WASHINGTON — Following the completion of the special counsel's 22-month probe, Attorney General William P. Barr declared Monday that Robert Mueller's investigation fully exonerates all members of Ronald Reagan's presidential administration from involvement in the Iran–Contra affair. "I've reviewed Mr. Mueller's findings and have determined conclusively that neither the late president nor any White House or Cabinet official serving between 1981 and 1989 ever ordered, oversaw, or even knew about the covert sales of American arms to Iran," Barr said in a letter to the House and Senate judiciary committees, clearing key figures such as retired National Security Adviser John Poindexter and former staffer Oliver North in a move that finally lifts what many have seen as a dark cloud over the scandal-plagued presidency. "I assessed this report carefully and can at long last say with full certainty that Caspar Weinberger, Robert McFarlane, Elliott Abrams, and all others in the president's inner circle operated lawfully from the time of the initial dealings in 1981 until the illegal arrangement was exposed five years later. From the 1985 diversion of funds to Contra rebels in Nicaragua, to Reagan's untruthful 1986 denial of an arms-for-hostage trade, to the flagrant destruction of countless documents relevant to the investigation, everyone acted properly and with the best interests of the United States in mind. It is my hope that the country can now move forward and put this unfortunate episode behind it." At press time, sources reported that Democratic leaders in Congress were still discussing a possible push for President Reagan's impeachment.

Bill Belichick Visits Hospital To Watch Terminally Ill Fan Die
BOSTON — Stressing the importance of taking time to make such trips to local medical centers, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick reportedly visited Massachusetts General Hospital Thursday to watch terminally ill fan Brian Keller die. "Brian's a big fan of the team, and as soon as I heard that he had taken a turn for the worse, I came right over to watch him struggle until the end," said Belichick, who stood outside Keller's room in the intensive care unit for over three hours and silently stared through the glass as the 28-year-old's organs shut down and he went into cardiac arrest. "I try to make it out here as many weekends as I can. Sometimes I'll be here for six or seven hours on a Saturday visiting fans in the cancer ward who are just hanging on by a thread. The look on their faces when they've lost consciousness for the last time — you can just see the life draining out of them. It means so much to me to be there in those moments." Sources confirmed that Belichick stayed to take pictures with Keller for several minutes after doctors had pronounced him dead.

Report: You're Far Too Dumb To Be Reading The Mueller Report Yourself
WASHINGTON — According to a conclusion reached by expert analysis Thursday, you are far too dumb to be reading Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election yourself. "To put it bluntly, you are a moron, and as a moron, you lack the basic reading skills that would make looking at this report fruitful in any way," read the analysis in part, adding that your best option here was to give up on trying to parse over 400 pages of legal text, admit that you are a goddamn idiot, and go back to looking at pictures of dogs or whatever the hell an imbecile like yourself wastes their life doing. "Wait a few days, let the grown-ups examine this, and then give them a chance to tell you what to think in simple infographic form. Until then, you might as well stop trying to sound out words like 'pursuant,' close your laptop or turn off your phone, and go to sleep for the rest of the day." The report concluded that despite your personal and intellectual failings, you should still give yourself a nice little pat on the back for trying.

Bill Belichick Builds New Tight End From Mutilated Dog Parts
FOXBOROUGH, MA — In a savage and gruesome turn of events, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick reportedly slaughtered a half-dozen dogs adopted from the humane society Friday, sewing together the dismembered body parts to construct a new, horrific tight end. "They were cute dogs at first, but then I figured out that if you rip them apart, they could be really useful," said Belichick, watching the fur-covered abomination lumber across the field, producing the blood-curdling sound of splintering bone and ripping flesh with every step. "While tinkering around in my workshop, I started out stitching a few dog legs together, combining ribcages and whatnot, and soon I was reanimating the dead tissue with a portable generator. In almost no time at all, I had a viable red zone target." Belichick confirmed that the grotesque tight end had a far better understanding of the offense and was considerably more intelligent than Rob Gronkowski.

Liberal Feels Like Idiot For Placing Entirety Of Hopes On Mueller Probe Instead Of New York Prosecutors' Investigation
MORENO VALLEY, CA — Kicking himself for focusing all his energy on the wrong thing, local liberal Brian Whitmore reportedly felt like an idiot Tuesday for placing the entirety of his hopes on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into President Trump instead of the New York state prosecutors' investigation. "I can't believe I was so naive as to think that the Mueller report would be the silver bullet implicating Trump in criminal election interference when it's obviously going to be the Southern District inquiry," said lifelong Democrat Whitmore, 31, adding that while he was still disappointed Mueller's report hadn't found the president guilty of collusion with Russia, several news articles he had just read made it clear to him that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York held all the real investigative power. "How could I have missed it before? It was always going to be impossible for Mueller to prove Trump colluded, but the campaign finance allegations — that's where the real action is. In fact, this was probably just what Mueller wanted all along. He did what he could do with his limited investigative mandate and now he's handing off the probe to state prosecutors who will have a much wider purview to throw the book at Trump. I mean, they're already working with Michael Cohen, and I bet that's only the beginning. I just feel so dumb for spending all that time obsessing over the Mueller investigation when I should've been spending all my time obsessing over the New York one." At press time, Whitmore was looking into getting his tattoo of Robert Mueller removed so he could replace it with one of New York federal prosecutor Audrey Strauss.

Report: It The Part Of Night Where Everyone Just Sort Of Goes Around And Remembers Commercials They Liked
AUSTIN, TX — Marking the end of the nearly four-hour televised event, Super Bowl party attendees confirmed Sunday that it is now the part of the night where everyone just sort of goes around and remembers which commercials they liked. "I loved the one with the celebrities who showed up as their most memorable characters," said party guest Andrew Duran, while other attendees shared catchphrases from spots and voiced their support for the commercial "with those big horses." "Of course, I'll always have a soft spot for the silly one with the former athlete, but the sentimental truck commercial with the dad was probably a close second. Oh, and that chip commercial for Pringles or Doritos or something was pretty good." This portion of the evening was immediately followed by a long, sad silence before the guests pulled out their phones and ordered cars to take them home.

"This is your church now, and you shall worship me," said Belichick, who sources confirmed clutched Tebow's throat and slammed the former Heisman Trophy winner against a concrete wall. "If you want to see a wrathful God, then question me on playing time. I will crush you into dust. And if I ever see you on your knees, you better be praying to me or you will be destroyed by my blistering fury." At press time, Tebow told reporters that he was renouncing Jesus Christ.

Out-Of-Work Robert Mueller Opens Investigation Into Whether Squirrels Knowingly Ate From Bird Feeder
WASHINGTON — Explaining there appeared to be a pattern of premeditated wrongdoing but that he didn't want to make any claims he couldn't substantiate with hard facts, an out-of-work Robert Mueller reportedly opened an investigation Friday into whether several neighborhood squirrels knowingly ate from his bird feeder. "On the one hand, there is just too much bird seed missing each morning to be attributable to birds alone, and on the other, there are a few suspicious squirrels who have been skulking around the yard lately — I think there's some collusion afoot, but right now, it's impossible to prove," said the unshaven former FBI director, showing reporters how he had propped up several camcorders on his windowsill to film the squirrels when he wasn't watching the animals through binoculars from under a canoe he'd flipped over in the corner of his yard. "I thought I had them the other night when the automatic light went on beside the garage, but by the time I got down there, the birdseed was gone. I followed the trail for a while, but it was raining and I lost the scent. There was a late-night meeting a few days ago between a possum and a raccoon I think might be germane to the case, but I don't want to leap to any conclusions. I haven't seen the raccoon interact with the squirrels yet, which makes me think there's some go-between critter I haven't identified. It's a big question mark on the board I've got inside. They're wily — they're trying to play 12-step chess. Fortunately, though, I've got some experience playing that game. And I've got all the time in the world ever since I cleared up that inquiry into why the begonias kept getting trampled and also since my wife left me." At press time, a frantic, wild-eyed Mueller had burst into FBI headquarters and demanded someone help him file a subpoena to get access to the inside of a tree where he suspected the squirrels were storing the stolen birdseed.

Kamala Harris Assembles Campaign Staff Of Unpaid California Prison Laborers
WASHINGTON — On the heels of yesterday's announcement that she would be running for president, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) reportedly began staffing her campaign Tuesday with unpaid inmates from California correctional facilities. "I'm so grateful to have such an incredible and devoted team headed up by my new campaign manager, Spider, as we work together to fight for American values," said Harris of the two dozen non-violent criminal offenders who would reportedly work shifts of up to 72 hours out of her campaign office in exchange for three square meals a day and all the "Kamala Harris 2020" merchandise they could carry. "Whether it's knocking on doors, leading focus groups, making phone calls, or helping prep me for upcoming media appearances, my entire staff will be comprised of unpaid prison laborers. Not only will this cut campaign-related expenses by up to $20 million, it will also allow inmates to spend time in the community and provide them with valuable work-related opportunities." Harris added that due to a quirk in California state law, most inmates would be ineligible to work for other political campaigns once they'd been released from prison.

Les Moonves Doesn't Know How He Going To Tell Wife He Didn't Get $120 Million Bonus
NEW YORK — Saying the news would come as a big disappointment to her, former CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves confided to reporters Tuesday that he was uncertain how to tell his wife Julie Chen he didn't get the $120 million bonus he had been expecting from the company. "She's going to be so upset with me when she finds out," said Moonves, adding that he could put off breaking it to Chen for a little while, but that eventually she would wonder what had happened to the nine-figure sum he had promised her he would be receiving upon his exit from CBS. "Julie was so excited when I told her about the big bonus I'd be getting this year. She even left her job at The Talk because I made it sound like a sure thing. Gosh, what if she's already spent some of it?" At press time, Moonves was reportedly worried that his wife had begun to suspect something was up after he canceled the big vacation they'd been looking forward to.

Exhausted Robert Mueller Turns Off Phone To Give Himself Breather From Russia Probe News Over Holiday Break
WASHINGTON — Desperate to unwind after months of nonstop work investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election, visibly exhausted Special Counsel Robert Mueller powered his phone down Friday in order to give himself a break from any news concerning the probe over the holiday break. "The last thing I want when I'm spending time with my family is a cascade of push notifications telling me yet another Russian oligarch, political operative, or highly placed socialite used Deutsche Bank channels to funnel money to the campaign," said the former FBI director, firmly holding down his phone's power button and adding that he wants to be "completely present in the moment" while celebrating with his loved ones, not ruminating about who met with which diplomat or whether someone was using social media to tamper with his witnesses. "I just want to have two calm weeks where I don't even think about Individual One. I won't even say his name. I'll have to wait to hear about any important developments in January, since I just know the second I read, say, something about Eric being involved more deeply than we previously suspected, I'll get pulled back in and ruin my whole vacation." At press time, Mueller had reactivated his phone just to check the news real quick.

Ecuadorian Officials Starting To Get Sick Of Julian Assange Always Leaving Dirty Dishes All Over Embassy
LONDON — Adding to the already long list of grievances they had with their guest, officials at the Ecuadorian embassy reported Thursday that they were beginning to get really sick of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange always leaving his dirty dishes around the premises. Sources said that Assange, whose presence has reportedly grown more and more disruptive since his arrival in 2012, has a habit of abandoning sauce-covered plates in random consular offices throughout the building. In addition, officials complained that Assange often blasts loud techno music during important calls with Quito, makes awkward conversation with visitors applying for visas, and loafs around conference rooms in his ratty, stained briefs while diplomats attempt to conduct meetings. "Pretty much every day, I come into the kitchen and he's burned a bunch of eggs on the pan, which he then just leaves on the stove," said Ecuadorian ambassador Juan Falconí Puig, adding that while Assange typically lets weeks' worth of bowls filled with milk residue and cereal-encrusted spoons pile up in the sink, they have also been discovered on windowsills, in the hallway outside his door, and, on one occasion, on top of a toilet tank. "He also leaves his takeout containers lying around everywhere, including the reception area, so people just get smacked by the odor of curry the minute they walk in." "And I can't tell you how many times I've had to pull clumps of stringy white hair out of the shower," added Puig. "It's, like, come on Julian. Other people use that shower too." Puig told reporters that staff members have confronted the 45-year-old multiple times about his behavior, but with little success. On issues ranging from eating other people's food to leaving dirty socks strewn on the embassy's main staircase to never in almost five years replacing the toilet paper, Puig said that Assange usually makes a big show of improving for a few days but then goes right back to his old habits. Sources confirmed that frustrated Ecuadorian officials have resorted to leaving harshly worded notes for Assange, but — as was the case with messages insisting Assange not to use the microwave to cook fish and not to drape wet towels on the backs of antique leather armchairs — the strategy has had no apparent effect. "Yesterday I was having a meeting with the Scottish Secretary of State, and Julian wanders into the conference room, props his bare feet up on the table, and just starts cutting his toenails," said Puig, noting that he had to stop himself from gagging when a small yellowed clipping nearly hit the rim of his water glass. "Fine, we're all sharing the same space, but at least put on a shirt if you're going to walk right through a negotiation session with the leaders of our host nation, you know?" "Maybe then we wouldn't mind as much when he opens a brand new jar of peanut butter and then immediately loses the lid," continued Puig. According to Puig, staff members have gently tried hinting that Assange should find a new place to live by pointing out how many other nice embassies there are around town, recently going so far as to slip in a link to the Belgian embassy at the bottom of an internal email about promoting Galapagos tourism. But officials told reporters that Assange may in fact be growing even more comfortable in his current surroundings, judging by the purchase of a large bookcase he was heard hammering together during a banquet for dignitaries from five other South American nations. "It would be one thing if it was just him, but he's got these weird friends who come around at all hours," said Puig, referring to the nameless group of associates who typically show up after midnight, remain silent even when greeted, and always keep their faces covered with black bandanas. "It's ridiculous — for some reason they insist on just hanging out here." "Not to mention how slow the internet gets when they're using it," added Puig. "God knows what they're all doing up there."

NFL Pre-emptively Adds Whatever Bullshit Gronk Hawking To Banned Substance List
NEW YORK — Claiming the measure was a necessary precaution to prevent what must be some pretty terrible side effects, representatives for the National Football League announced plans Friday to add whatever bullshit Rob Gronkowski was hawking on social media to the banned substances list. "We're looking out for the best interests of our players by just going ahead and prohibiting whatever CBD-based nonsense Gronkowski is peddling," said spokesperson Brian McCarthy, clarifying that league officials had not conducted any formal testing before forbidding the substance, but were 100% confident in the dangers it poses to anyone who ingests it. "After reviewing Gronk's claims about his ability to heal himself over the course of a summer, we had more than enough information to constitute an immediate, permanent ban. Even if it doesn't affect or enhance players' performance, we don't want to take any chances. As far as we're concerned, anything that Gronk promotes on Twitter can't be safe for human consumption." At press time, league sources announced that they were keeping their eyes on all that Tom Brady "TB12" shit just to be safe.

Report: Mueller Investigation Nearly Done With First Day Of Trump Campaign
WASHINGTON — Confirming that the special counsel's probe into potential Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election had made significant progress, sources in the Justice Department revealed to reporters Tuesday that Robert Mueller's investigation was nearly done with the first day of the Trump campaign. "After two years of thoroughly pursuing all leads and documenting any evidence that suggests a connection between the Trump team and Russia, the Mueller investigation is almost ready to reveal the crimes and misdeeds that occurred within the first 24 hours of his campaign," said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding that Mueller's investigation was nearly finished compiling the Trump campaign's illicit behavior during working hours on June 16, 2015 and could finally move on to indictments for the early evening. "We can also confirm that the special counsel is expediting his efforts to get the investigation of the first day done and recently requested extra staff to deal with the volume of the potential criminal behavior during the 4-4:30 p.m. period alone. At this rate, he should be ready to reveal his findings about the first 96 hours of the Trump campaign by 2020." Justice Department sources also cautioned people following the investigation not to get too excited about it ending with bombshell arrests, and estimated that it would likely lead to indictments for only 10-12 percent of the U.S. population.

Depressed Mueller Wonders What It Is About Him That Makes Everyone Lie To Him
WASHINGTON — Expressing self-contempt after learning that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort likely violated the terms of his plea deal, special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly wondered Tuesday what it was about him that makes everyone lie to his face. "It seems like no one ever tells me the truth — what am I doing wrong? I mean, I'm not even that mad about all the collusion stuff; I'm just hurt that they don't respect me enough, to be honest," said Mueller, who wiped away a tear while admitting that "all the secrets and lies" had jeopardized his capacity to trust new people and damaged his personal relationships. "I put my faith in these guys to be straight with me, but I suppose there's just something about me that makes people feel comfortable walking all over me. I guess I'm just a big pushover." At press time, a despondent Mueller announced plans to step away from the investigation to take some time for personal reflection and figure out why this kept happening.

'It's Like All The President's Men Meets Rambo,' Says Robert Mueller Describing Report To Congress
WASHINGTON — Briefing members of Congress who he doubted had read all the way through the "thrilling tale of redemption and American justice," Robert Mueller pitched his special counsel report Wednesday as All The President's Men meets Rambo. "It's just the story of an all-American badass who gets fed up with the system and dedicates his life to bringing down the corrupt powers that be," Mueller told the House Judiciary Committee, adding that the 448-page report contains scenes of "wall-to-wall action" in which a tough, determined underdog fights his way through the corridors of power in Washington before finally defeating all his enemies and restoring liberty to the land. "This guy just crushes everything in his path. He's a killing machine, but he also has a code of honor. Though people constantly count him out, he never stops fighting for freedom and the American way. It's honestly a fantastic story, and I hope I get to write a sequel." Mueller did express disappointment over an unfinished portion of the report in which the hero's archnemesis, Attorney General William Barr, gets kicked into an Air Force One jet engine.

"Three months into her pregnancy, our crew spotted the usually trim duchess exhibiting a budding belly," Daily Mirror celebrity reporter Stephanie Wood said of the expectant Middleton, who reportedly showed off her ballooning middle after leaving a routine appointment at St. Thomas' Hospital. "Though the duchess appeared a little fatigued, we can hardly blame her. After all, she's smiling for two now!" When reached for comment, Middleton appeared overwhelmed by her highly anticipated bundle of joy, saying only, "I can't believe this is happening," before royal guards escorted the weary mommy-to-be back to her private quarters at Buckingham Palace.

WASHINGTON — Laying on his horn while stuck in bumper-to-bumper gridlock, an annoyed special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly screamed at "dipshit protestors" from his car Thursday as a MoveOn rally held up traffic during his nightly commute. "Get a move on, assholes! Some of us have actual paying jobs and want to get home to our families after a long day at the office," shouted the frustrated former FBI director, rolling down his window and berating the thousands of protestors to "shut the fuck up already" so he could "get out of this goddamn city." "Seriously, don't any of you people have jobs? It's 5 p.m. on a Thursday. And hello? What happened to using sidewalks or speaking in a reasonable tone? Jesus, this shit should be illegal." At press time, Mueller had reportedly been arrested for beating a protestor unconscious after the demonstrator kicked a dent into the side of his car.

Pope Francis Offers Molested Kids 10% Off At Vatican City Gift Shop
VATICAN CITY — In a gesture of goodwill intended to show the Papacy's support for victims, Pope Francis announced Thursday that children who have been sexually abused by Catholic clergy would receive 10 percent off at the Vatican City gift shop. "While we will never be able to completely undo the damage that was done, it is my hope that those who were sexually abused can ease some of their pain by enjoying a discount on hats, T-shirts, and other merch at our lovely gift shop," said the Pontiff, who explained that the reduced prices would be offered to anyone who could provide proof of molestation and came forward prior to his rise to the Papacy in 2013. "These were heinous crimes, and Christ calls on us to be generous towards those who have suffered. So please, browse the wide selection of devotional statuettes and decorative crucifixes available in our store, or go online and enter the code 'MOLESTED' to get the discount as well as free shipping on any orders over $100." Pope Francis added that any clergy abuse victims who visited the Vatican in person could also enjoy a complimentary framed photo of either him or Pope Benedict.

'Don't Make Me Regret This,' Mueller Tells Rick Gates Before Uncuffing Him To Work On Investigation Together
WASHINGTON — Advising the former political consultant not to take advantage of his goodwill, Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly told Rick Gates Thursday "don't make me regret this" before uncuffing him to work on the Trump investigation together. "You've helped me out so far, and I appreciate that, but I've got my eye on you, Gates, so don't try anything stupid," said Mueller, placing his gun on the table as the man who pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and had since been aiding in the Russia investigation massaged his sore wrists, then opening the door to the motel room where Gates had been under lock and key for months. "You track down my leads and get me what I want, and we'll keep this cordial. I don't trust you as far as I can throw you, Gates, but we're in this mess together, and dammit if you're not the only one who can get us out. But if you cross me, if you step even a toe out of line, you're finished. Remember that." Mueller added that Gates better not even think of trying anything like the stunt Paul Manafort pulled and make a break for it right after the handcuffs were off, because it was only going to make things much, much worse for him in the long run.

Cut This Monster Out Of Me
By now the news has no doubt spread that early this morning I was admitted to the hospital due to severe morning sickness, a side effect accompanying my first pregnancy. Yes, it's true: After a year and a half of marriage, William and I are expecting a child, a greatly anticipated occasion that has brought much joy to the Crown and personal horror to me, the innocent woman who was chosen from among millions to act, unwittingly, as nothing more than vessel for a deformed and unnatural being. For the love of God, for the love of all that is holy, cut this fucking monster out of me! I don't care how it's done. Use scissors. Use a razor. Use a bloody letter opener — just slice this demon from my womb and burn it to a crisp. Even now, restrained here in my hospital gurney, I can feel it gestating inside me, a malformed abomination wrought from centuries of inbreeding and an ancient pact of unspeakable evil. I can feel its scaly skin rubbing coarsely against the placenta. It knows what it is. It knows the power it wields even now. And all day long it demands to be fed, fed, fed. I cannot stand it any longer! Oh, what a fool I was. Like a schoolgirl, I actually believed I'd stepped into a fairy tale, with my prince charming at my side. Sweet illusion, how I longed for you to be real. Instead, a year after my wedding, the groom's female relatives began to prepare me for pregnancy and childbirth, praying to the gods of fertility, slaughtering the beasts of the field, and feeding me special elixirs of obscure origin. Then finally, on the first full moon of autumn, the implantation process commenced, with the royal family gathering around in a circle as the prince planted his seed inside my womb, his vicious thrusts eliciting warm smiles of approval while my helpless shrieks fell on deaf ears. And now, I am not one but two — the creature lurks within me. At night, it speaks to me, it's arcane murmurs filling my ears. I long to rip it from my gut, but the footmen watch me day and night. As soon as sleep finally arrives, I find my psyche plagued by nightmares of terrifying vividness — 10,000 horses drowning in pus; crimson-eyed children feasting on the head of King Richard II; a smiling, dagger-toothed worm wriggling in viscous slime. And in the morning, it — the twisted, expanding it — demands its food: pebbles, mud, raw beef, and ale. The concoction twists my stomach in endless knots, and the beast inside me growls with satisfaction. And William — vile, uncaring William — is nowhere to be seen. On the infrequent occasion he does arrive at my bedside I cannot bear to look at him; I recoil from his touch. Indeed, my only happiness in the past weeks has been the warm smile of the nursemaid who cleans my body and washes my hair, preparing me for the coming of the homunculus. Hear my words! Let not the cheers of Britons resound in the streets and fields of this sceptred isle, for in me grows a hellspawn intent on maleficence! I have but time for this one short missive I write to you now, imploring you, all of you, to please sever this inhuman wretch from my stomach! Do not gaze in its unborn eyes, for it shall entrance you! The parasite shall poison your mind and convince you of your love for it! Do not let it! Kill the parasite! Drain the blood from its throat!

Kavanaugh Blasted For Destroying Reputation Of Good Man
WASHINGTON — Decrying the tactics as a smear campaign against an exemplary judge, Republicans blasted Brett Kavanaugh Friday for destroying the sterling reputation of a good man. "It's despicable that this individual waited until the 11th hour to engage in offensive, partisan attacks in an attempt to discredit a decent and upstanding man," said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), noting that Kavanaugh's recriminations had repeatedly made a mockery of the entire confirmation process. "We're talking about a devoted husband and father who was the top of his class at Yale and received accolades from the American Bar Association. And now his life has been destroyed by a completely non-credible individual bent on revenge. He has cast a cloud over this esteemed man and he should be deeply ashamed of the damage he has done to his family and the country as a whole." Grassley added that he was confident the nomination of a morally upright man who had served his country for decades would not be derailed by the ravings of an inveterate liar like Kavanaugh.

Senator Feinstein Wondering If Now A Good Time To Disclose 7 Highly Credible Murder Allegations Against Kavanaugh She Received Weeks Ago
WASHINGTON — Weighing the importance of the information against the potential political fallout, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) debated Friday whether or not now might be a prudent time to introduce into discussion the seven highly credible murder accusations against Brett Kavanaugh that were given to her in August. "Roughly five weeks ago, the family members of five slain women and two men presented me with dozens of file boxes full of concrete, corroborated evidence that Kavanaugh was personally and solely responsible for the deaths, and I'm now experiencing a strong feeling that maybe the other Senators, the media, and the American public should know," said Feinstein, who also disclosed that dozens of people had come forward with information further connecting Kavanaugh to a string of brutal stranglings committed from 1986 to 2011, but had been turned away over concerns that it wasn't relevant to the confirmation process. "His fingerprints are all over the crime scenes, there is DNA evidence from blood he left, and there are three dozen eyewitnesses. But information like that could really energize the Republican base, so you can see my dilemma here." At press time, Feinstein had decided to sit on the evidence until a more politically expedient time.

Brett Kavanaugh Reiterates Cruel And Unusual Punishment What Makes Someone A True Kappa
WASHINGTON — In a statement confirming his support of the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision on lethal injection and the Eighth Amendment, Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh reiterated his belief Monday that cruel and unusual punishment was "what makes someone a true Kappa." "The Amendments to the Constitution are full of nuance, and it's time the court acknowledged that actions so often classified as 'cruel and unusual punishment' are actually vital in helping young guys claim their spot in the Kappa brotherhood," said Kavanaugh, who cited his personal experience in rushing a fraternity and the vital role severe pain, terror, and shame played in thoroughly vetting the ideal Delta Kappa Epsilon member. "If you're creating a frat brother from scratch, you want a guy who can inflict excessive suffering in a worthless piece of shit pledge who drinks like a little bitch. Without subjecting a pledge to excessive pain and suffering, there's no way for the rest of the frat to know who can handle their shit and who would be better off with the total fucking pussies in Pike." Kavanaugh also concluded that the death row inmate at the center of the Supreme Court case was "clearly not cut out for the best frat on campus."

Man Confused By Obscure Down-Ballot Measure About Deciding Who His Senator Should Be
FORT WAYNE, IN — Growing increasingly frustrated as he attempted to cast his vote in the midterm elections despite a severe lack of clarity and transparency, citizen Geoff Barnes admitted Tuesday that he was deeply confused by an obscure down-ballot measure to determine the senator for his district. "I don't even know who these people are or what this 'senator' thing is supposed to be, but I hate to just guess," said Barnes, visibly annoyed at the ballot's lack of any explanation as to what exactly the measure comprised and the absence of any kind of key that might help him comprehend the (R) and (D) symbols appearing next to the accompanying names. "I hate how they sneak these little things in at the end without giving you any information. Obviously, I know what I want done for the major issues, such as the dog park initiative and the new water reclamation substation, but who knows about this piddly stuff. Honestly, it's things like this that keep people from voting altogether." Barnes ultimately decided to register his displeasure by writing in the pseudonym "Joe Donnelly" instead.

Kavanaugh Impressed By Hazing Rituals Before They Let You Join Supreme Court
WASHINGTON — Admitting he was surprised by all the tasks required of him in order to enter the prestigious organization, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh reportedly stated Thursday that he was impressed by the hazing rituals you have to go through before they let you join the Supreme Court. "Man, I knew the Supreme Court doesn't let just anyone in, but I've got to say, they've really made me run the gauntlet and do all this embarrassing stuff — I mean, I had to go on national television with my wife and tell everyone how long I was a virgin," said Kavanaugh, acknowledging that he had to respect the humiliating challenges he's been put through to prove himself worthy of the Supreme Court, like showing his high school diary to the entire country and having to face multiple women from his youth who he "didn't even go all the way with." "I did some pretty gnarly stuff back during my fraternity days, so I figured they'd force me to get paddled or chant the Supreme Court motto 'Equal Justice Under Law' for a few hours outside in my underwear or stick my thumb up someone's ass, but this hazing is really putting me through a wringer. But I'll do whatever I have to if it means they'll let me be a justice. Supreme Court for life!" Kavanaugh added that when he had felt especially ashamed during the hazing process, he just reminded himself that this was the same initiation his future Supreme Court brother Clarence Thomas had to endure.

Huckabee Sanders Claims Playing Cohen Tape Backward Reveals Hidden Message Exonerating Trump From All Wrongdoing
WASHINGTON — Explaining that the release of the secretly recorded conversation between Donald Trump and Michael Cohen could not have come at a better time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated Wednesday that playing the tape backward reveals a hidden message exonerating Trump from any misconduct. "I can confirm that if you play these recordings backward and at half speed, you can clearly hear the voice of Barack Obama saying, 'We should frame Donald Trump so people think it was him, not me, who had all those extramarital affairs,' and then Cohen saying, 'You're my best client, Barack,'" said the White House press secretary, adding that if you turn the treble all the way up and listen closely around the tape's six-minute mark, you can make out former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz instructing staffers to steal hacked email servers. "President Trump is actually quite grateful for the release of this tape, as it provides conclusive proof that investigations into his financial transactions and personal life are merely witch hunts meant to distract Americans from the real issues. Try it at home and hear the truth for yourself." Huckabee Sanders went on to add that, later in the tape, one hears the voices of both Bill and Hillary Clinton confessing to the murder of Vince Foster.

Huckabee Sanders Tells Colleagues She's Taking Temporary Post As Google CEO Before Transitioning Into Full-Time Role As Sultan Of Brunei
WASHINGTON — Informing those in her professional life of her career plans, outgoing White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reportedly told colleagues Friday she would be serving for a time as CEO of Google before gradually taking on a permanent position as the sultan of Brunei. "It's been the honor of my life to work in the White House, but I'm excited to lead a $750 billion company in Silicon Valley and begin my reign as one of the world's last absolute monarchs," said Huckabee Sanders, explaining she had reluctantly turned down offers to direct the next Star Wars film, design the 2024 Olympic stadium, and become the first person to set foot on Mars, in addition to a lucrative position as head of neurosurgery at the Mayo Clinic. "Saudi Arabia and Monaco were both pursuing me pretty hard with head of state jobs, and Uber's been trying to recruit me for their top post for 19 years now, but those opportunities just didn't have the work–life balance I was looking for. Believe me, it was a tough choice. I spent hours talking it over with my husbands George Clooney, Tom Brady, and Jason Aldean. While I'm excited to begin my next chapter, I'll be taking some time off for myself first. So don't be surprised if you see me this summer relief-pitching for the Dodgers or traversing the Congo Rainforest with my best friend, Cardi B!" Huckabee Sanders went on to state that she was currently busy reviewing designs for the awards display she will build in the Bruneian palace of Istana Nurul Iman to showcase her multiple Emmys, Pulitzers, and Nobel Peace Prizes.

Huckabee Sanders Repeatedly Insists That President's Footprints Created The Great Lakes
WASHINGTON — Chastising the assembled reporters for failing to cover the story, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeatedly insisted Wednesday that President Trump's footprints created the Great Lakes. "In its relentless effort to undermine this administration, the media has completely ignored the fact that Lake Huron and Lake Ontario were formed when the gigantic, thundering footfalls of the president made impressions in the ground during a stroll along the U.S.-Canada border," said Huckabee Sanders, adding that media outlets had willfully chosen not to acknowledge that the enormousness of Lake Superior was due to the president jumping up as high as the moon and landing on the earth with all his might. "Frankly, it's disgusting that journalists are obsessed with the president's health when they should know full well that when he was five years old, he was already so big that he had to use a wagon wheel as a coat button and so strong that he could clear a whole pond of bullfrogs with one holler." At press time, however, Huckabee Sanders had amended her remarks, noting that Fox News had indeed reported that the president's frustration with Democrats had led him to shed the massive teardrops that formed the Mississippi River.

Huckabee Sanders Warns Stormy Daniels' Disclosures Just Steamy, Sexy Distraction From Real Issues
WASHINGTON — Urging journalists not to fixate on specious rumors and instead pursue topics of real importance, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders warned reporters assembled for the press briefing Thursday that allegations of President Trump's affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels were a steamy, sexy distraction from the real issues. "Look, I know how easy it is to get all hot and bothered while reading these tantalizing stories about the president, but Americans need to focus on the concrete problems affecting our nation," said a sweaty, visibly aroused Huckabee Sanders, who flushed noticeably and bit her bottom lip as she encouraged reporters to concentrate on the issues concerning everyday citizens instead of whatever filthy, animalistic sexual acts may or may not have occurred during a hedonistic weekend in Beverly Hills. "Journalists should be reporting on the decreasing unemployment rate and the return of manufacturing jobs, not the president's engorged genitals or the intoxicating idea of two people in a five-star Lake Tahoe hotel room tonguing honey from each other's secret places during an illicit tryst. However titillating they might be, these rumors are just a diversion from the hard, sweaty work of helping the American worker onto his back. Back on his feet." Huckabee Sanders then apologized for emptying a pitcher of ice water over her head during her presentation, excused herself, and staggered moaning from the briefing room.

NBC On Olympics Coverage: 'Sorry We Didn't Alter The Laws Of Space And Time To Accommodate People's Schedules'
NEW YORK — Responding to widespread criticism of its decision to air coverage of Olympic events on a six-hour time delay, NBC issued an apology Tuesday to American viewers, saying it was really, really sorry for failing to alter the governing laws of space and time to accommodate everyone's precious schedules. "We at NBC would like to sincerely apologize for not doing something so simple as to modify the physical properties of the known universe so that you could go home and watch the women's 100-meter backstroke live," chief digital officer Vivian Schiller said in response to widespread criticism on social media, adding that the network would "get one of our theoretical physicists right on that for you. " "On second thought, we really should have considered manipulating the invariant properties of the space-time continuum while we were still in the planning stages of our coverage, and, boy, it sure was silly of us not to. " Schiller noted that if viewers continue to be dissatisfied with the network's coverage, they can feel free to switch over to an alternate plane of reality wherein temporal events and the subjective experience of said events may be shifted at will.

Rudy Giuliani Adds More Planes, Towers With Each Subsequent Retelling Of 9/11
NEW YORK — Every recounting including more devastation than the last, sources reported Monday that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has added more planes and towers with each subsequent retelling of the events of 9/11. "When the 90th plane hit Tower 477, I knew I was dealing with something this country had never seen before," said Giuliani, growing teary-eyed as he described surveying the charred ruins of the Ground Zero sites that extended the entire length of Manhattan. "At that time, I didn't know who exactly we were up against, only that every single skyscraper in New York, including several in Brooklyn and Queens, had been destroyed and that it would be my job to lead this city under unimaginable circumstances. I'd like to think there's a reason everybody calls me 'America's Mayor' to this very day." Giuliani went on to say that he'd also heard something about an attack on the Pentagon but remained hazy on the details.

LONDON — Members of the U.S. men's gymnastics team have continued to apologize for their fifth-place finish in Monday's team finals, mistakenly convinced that they dashed the entire nation's dreams of Olympic glory. "They didn't even come close to letting us down," said Minnesota resident Harry Camiel, referring to the male gymnasts who earlier fought back tears as they struggled to express how deeply sorry they were for breaking the hearts of the 300 million devoted fans they believed were counting on them. "Not a big deal. We don't actually care one way or the other whether you won or lost. It's not something important like basketball. " At press time, the U.S. populace was unavailable for further comment, as it was completely absorbed in highlights from the Blue Jays–Mariners game.

Brian Kemp Campaign Energized After Seeing Early Voter Suppression Numbers
ATHENS, GA — Saying that the data heralded a promising outcome for election day, representatives from Brian Kemp's gubernatorial campaign were reportedly energized Thursday after perusing early voter suppression numbers. "It's very exciting to see that with five days to go before the election, thousands of Georgians have already unsuccessfully attempted to cast their ballots," said communications director Ryan Mahoney, noting that while these figures were not entirely predictive, they indicated a strong likelihood that the number of minority voters turned away at polling places would be extremely high on Nov. 6. "We still have our work cut out for us, obviously, but the more people who are prevented from casting mail-in or provisional ballots ahead of time, the more resources we can expend towards keeping down the vote next week. So far, our expectations have been wildly exceeded, and if these trends continue, we may be seeing suppression levels that haven't been reached since the 1950s." Mahoney also urged Republican voters in urban areas to assist the campaign by making a plan to intimidate their friends and neighbors this upcoming Tuesday.

'The Onion' Proudly Stands With The Media As The Enemy Of The People
In recent days, President Donald Trump has increased his criticism of the media, and at a briefing Thursday, his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, controversially refused to walk back his statements. Recognizing that unity in the journalistic profession is absolutely essential to allowing reporters to bravely and securely practice their craft, The Onion announces that we proudly stand with our brothers and sisters in the media as the enemy of the people. When the Trump administration refers to news organizations as antagonists to the American public, we know exactly what they're doing: correctly identifying the awesome power that we hold over the slobbering masses and trying to drive a wedge between the public and the fourth estate. Rest assured, however, that this wedge was already there. We in the news media despised you imbeciles long before Trump, and we'll despise you long after he's gone. Honestly, you empty-headed dipshits who can barely process a simple headline or understand its meaning should be happy we interact with you at all. An utter contempt for the idiotic multitudes has been a cornerstone of American journalism virtually since its inception, and we at The Onion are grateful for our colleagues at hallowed institutions such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN who have served as pioneers in relentlessly tormenting the public by obscuring the truth, promoting wanton hysteria, and lying to their faces. We stand alongside them as staunch enemies of everyday Americans. When one of our colleagues at some lesser publication criticizes any politician's assault on journalists, what you must understand is that this is merely another — in our opinion, fairly transparent — effort to elicit easy sympathy from feeble-minded media consumers for some sort of manufactured conflict between the government and the press. Nevertheless, all that exists is the media's collective effort to lead you morons further and further from useful information, critical thought, and truth itself. And, honestly, why on God's green earth should we try to help anyone who is as willfully ignorant and so unconcerned with maintaining a country with even a veneer of representative democracy as Americans? Mr. Trump believes the press is too critical of him. No fucking shit. We are critical of everyone who is not us. The press hates you. All of you. We are what you deserve. God bless America.

Chuck Grassley Accidentally Lies In State For Few Hours After Drifting Off In Capitol Rotunda
WASHINGTON — Surrounded by onlookers, former colleagues, and Supreme Court Justices paying respect to the slumbering U.S. Senator, Chuck Grassley (R-IA) accidentally lay in state for a few hours Monday after drifting off in the Capitol rotunda. "Today, we honor a giant of the United States Senate, a devoted father, and a dear personal friend for his great service to this country," said a tearful Majority Whip John Cornyn in a stirring retrospective about the sleeping Iowa Republican, whose quietly dozing body had been mistakenly draped in a U.S. flag for public viewing just hours after the exhausted 85-year-old senator reportedly yawned and stretched out on the floor for a catnap beneath a frieze of George Washington. "We may salute him today with a procession. We may lower the flags as he lies in repose. But we will never forget what he has sacrificed for our nation. Rest in peace, my friend." Several hours after the ceremony ended, a dazed Grassley snapped awake in the darkened chamber, pulled several pieces of regalia off himself, and stumbled away in confusion while a member of the Capitol police wasn't looking.

Cold Panic Grips Stacey Abrams As Trump Begins Delivering Speech Almost Identical To One She Wrote
WASHINGTON — Breaking into an anxious sweat while listening to the State of the Union address, Stacy Abrams reportedly suffered a panic attack Tuesday as she began to realize that President Trump was delivering a speech nearly identical to the one she already wrote. "Dammit, it's not word for word, but all the same points about building a wall for border security, the booming economy, and defeating ISIS are all in there," said the frantic, trembling Georgia Democrat, who wiped her brow while scrambling to make quick edits to her speech in an effort to lessen the obvious similarities between her rebuttal and the president's current address. "At first I thought maybe they'd be different enough, but as soon as he started talking about the migrant caravan, I knew I was toast. Shit, everyone will think I just copied him. I spent so much time on this, and now I have to rush to rearrange the whole thing. 'America First' was supposed to be my shining moment. At least I can keep the part about loving my son Eric." At press time, Abrams had ripped up her speech and completely started from scratch after hearing Trump deliver the same take on the threat of fake news.

Clinton Already Working On Follow-Up Book Casting Blame For Failures Of First
CHAPPAQUA, NY — Saying it would provide a candid account of her experiences writing an unsuccessful tell-all, sources confirmed Thursday that Hillary Clinton is already working on a follow-up book casting blame for the failures of her previous memoir What Happened. "From my agent negotiating that underwhelming deal with Simon & Schuster, to the graphic designer's lackluster cover art, to my so-called supporters who couldn't be bothered to drop $17.99 for the hardcover copy — everyone had a hand in undermining my last book's success," reads a passage from the introduction to Clinton's What Also Happened, which repeatedly decries her prior book's "indecipherable" font and dedicates an entire chapter to lashing out at her copy editor for making her look like "an idiot third-grader." "I'll never forget how Amazon buried me and how Barnes & Noble completely sabotaged me by displaying my book way in the back in that no man's land by the CDs. Frankly, it's obvious I got screwed on all sides." Accusing them of stealing her spotlight, the book reportedly concludes with a long list of every other celebrity who published a memoir in the past year.

Environmentalists Warn Swedish Fish Population Being Decimated By Great Pacific Sour Patch
SANTA BARBARA, CA — Saying the world must act quickly to save the chewy organisms before it was too late, environmentalists warned Tuesday that the world's Swedish Fish population has been decimated by the Great Pacific Sour Patch. "For years, humanity has increased its sour candy production, dumping unnatural levels of mouth-puckering flavor into the ocean and leaving these defenseless creatures to pay the cost," said oceanologist Dr. Rachel Solnit, describing the heart-wrenching sight of Swedish Fish tangled in peach rings and gummy cola bottles after swimming close to the 270,0000-square-mile stretch of sweet-and-sour debris. "Entire schools of Swedish Fish will often mistake the patch's Sour Straws for a food source only to get trapped in the mass's powerful undertow along with chocolate turtles and gummy sharks. We try to rescue as many as we can, but ultimately, Swedish Fish were never supposed to be exposed to this level of blue raspberry tartness." At press time, the Sierra Club abandoned an attempt to clean up a large segment of the patch using a 10,000-mile-long Fun Dip stick.

Congress Wishes They Could Help Puerto Rico But It's All The Way Over There
WASHINGTON — Emphasizing that they really want to help any way they can, members of Congress announced Friday that while they desperately wish they could lend aid and assistance to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico while it struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, the fact remains that the island is all the way over there. "It should go without saying that our hearts go out to the residents of Puerto Rico in this hour of need, and we want nothing more than to help its citizens, but they live way, way off in the sticks," said Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI), stressing that Puerto Rico is not connected to the mainland by either bridges or tunnels, and when you look at a map you can plainly see it is all the way out in the Caribbean. "Let's be clear — we all feel that it would be fantastic to provide these people post-disaster assistance, but have you ever been to that part of the world? It's pretty much halfway around the globe. Any doctors, engineers, or infrastructure technicians we sent would be, like, 'Ugh, how long does it take to go the whole way to Puerto Rico?' after just a few hours, trust me." Congress has also released a non-binding resolution officially declaring that by the time any U.S. aid reached Puerto Rican residents, they probably would have the hurricane damage all fixed anyway.

WASHINGTON — Explaining that they have finally started to feel a connection with the Democratic Party nominee, millions of defeated and utterly exhausted voters admitted to reporters Wednesday they are now starting to relate to Hillary Clinton. "I never thought I had much in common with her before, but after waking up today feeling so drained and beaten, I think I'm beginning to see that she and I really are a lot alike," said 34-year-old Chicago resident Anthony Pallister, echoing the sentiments of Americans across the country who claimed that over the course of the last 24 hours, the feeling that they had suffered through a long, wearying ordeal only to be summarily rejected had caused them to notice many similarities between themselves and the 69-year-old presidential candidate. "The more I think about how dejected and overcome I feel, the more I begin to see myself and my viewpoints in Hillary Clinton. In fact, I don't know the last time I've related to a candidate this much." Many Americans went on to confirm that their perception of Hillary Clinton being completely out of touch with the majority of the country has now made the former secretary of state far more likable.

As part of his duties, the black man will have to spend four to eight years cleaning up the messes other people left behind. The job comes with such intense scrutiny and so certain a guarantee of failure that only one other person even bothered applying for it. Said scholar and activist Mark L.

Millions Gather Under Times Square Countdown Clock To Celebrate End Of 2016 Election
NEW YORK — Marking the joyous occasion with singing, dancing, and a chorus of ecstatic cheers, an estimated 2 million citizens gathered beneath the Times Square countdown clock Tuesday night to celebrate the end of the 2016 election season, sources reported. The crowd of revelers — many of whom had arrived in the early morning to stake out prime viewing locations — reportedly swelled in volume throughout the night, spilling over into nearby streets as many popped bottles of champagne, embraced loved ones, and finally joined together in a boisterous countdown seconds before the polls were scheduled to close. "God, this is so amazing," said local man Mark Edwards, gazing up at a fireworks display signaling the conclusion of the incessant media coverage, debates, stump speeches, and campaign advertisements of the election cycle. "I can't even begin to describe how excited everyone is here. It's really unbelievable." "Wooooo!" he shouted, his voice nearly drowned out by the sound of Kool & The Gang's "Celebration" emanating from loudspeakers situated on buildings around the square. According to witnesses, the scene was one of unbridled merriment, with roars of delight sweeping through the crowd every time the enormous LED screens in Times Square showed that voting had ended in another state. As vote totals began to come in, thousands in attendance reportedly raised their arms in jubilation, unfurled homemade banners, or placed calls to family members, often yelling to be heard over the sound of whistles, noisemakers, and the exuberant din of the crowd. Throughout the night's revelry, celebrants were also seen craning their necks and hoisting children onto their shoulders to view the One Times Square Astrovision screen displaying live feeds of equally raucous celebrations in downtown Los Angeles, Chicago's Loop, Miami Beach, Market Square Park in Houston, and other locations throughout the country "We stood out in the cold all day to get a good spot, but what's a few extra hours of discomfort when you've been looking forward to this for so long?" said Alice Castillo, who told reporters she had driven there from Baltimore with her two daughters to be part of the excitement. "Could we have stayed home and watched it all on TV? Of course. But nothing compares to the thrill of sharing this incredible moment with so many other people." "When the clock struck zero and everyone erupted into cheers, it was pretty magical," Castillo added. While the crowd was said to have thinned after the polls closed along the East Coast, a reported 250,000 remained well into the night to take in the joyful atmosphere and pack the area's overflowing bars. One of the Times Square celebrants, 36-year-old Brett Cleaver, said the night's festivities had caused him to reflect on the past year and consider how tonight represented a fresh start. "Beginning tomorrow, I'm going to try to cherish every second I have where I don't hear the phrase 'swing state' or see footage from a campaign rally," Cleaver told reporters, beaming at the prospect of never again looking at an article that speculated on how undecided voters would react to Donald Trump's or Hillary Clinton's latest statements. "For tonight, though, I'm just soaking up as much of this moment as I can." Added Cleaver, "I'm already excited to come back and do this again in 2020."

Stephen Miller Furious At ProPublica For Only Releasing 7-Minute Recording Of Immigrant Children Sobbing
WASHINGTON — Claiming that the publication of such a brief, tantalizing bit of audio was a breach of their journalistic responsibility, a furious Stephen Miller told reporters Tuesday that he was outraged at ProPublica for only releasing seven minutes of immigrant children sobbing. "It's unacceptable that this so-called news organization saw fit to foist this total tease of a clip on the American public," said Miller, who expressed frustration that the audio, in which 10 detained Central American children can be heard crying out for their parents, ended before reaching "the really good stuff." "Sure, they're wailing 'Mami' and 'Papa' so hard they can't breathe, and I guess the part where that 6-year-old desperately rattles off her aunt's phone number is kind of satisfying, but ultimately it only conveys a very small fraction of what we're doing here. I've listened to this recording dozens and dozens of times in the past day, and it's just simply nowhere near enough to scratch the itch. Shame on you, ProPublica." Miller added that the one silver lining was the likelihood that other outlets would soon broadcast hours of comprehensive, high-quality footage of immigrant children being tormented.

Panicking Taylor Swift Realizes It Too Late To Call Off Assassination After Katy Perry Makes Peace Offering
NEW YORK — Her hands shaking as she dialed several numbers written on a piece of paper in an effort to get in touch with the goons she had hired, a panicking Taylor Swift reportedly realized Wednesday that it was too late to call off the assassination of Katy Perry after her longtime rival made a peace offering. "Shit, shit, shit — Bruno, is that you? Call it off, call it off! Peacock! Peacock! Tell them not to shoot!" the 29-year-old pop star was heard to yell into her cell phone after seeing Perry's Instagram post where her former enemy had tagged her and written "Peace At Last," before being told by her contact, "I am sorry, Ms. Swift, but the die has been cast." "Come on, please tell them I don't need them anymore. What do you mean all the fail-safes are no longer possible? Look, I made a mistake. Things have changed, I don't need her to die now. You'll still get your money — I'll double your fee! Please just don't kill her." At press time, Swift made a last-ditch attempt to forestall the assassination by frantically calling Perry to tell her not to sing "Swish Swish" at a concert, only to be told that Perry was already onstage and would start the song in five minutes.

Area Liberal No Longer Recognizes Fanciful, Wildly Inaccurate Mental Picture Of Country He Lives In
CHICAGO — Expressing dismay and confusion over voters selecting Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, area liberal Ryan Garlock reportedly told a group of his friends Wednesday that he no longer recognizes his fanciful, wildly inaccurate mental picture of the country he lives in. "This just isn't the America I know," said Garlock, adding that the broad national support for a candidate who openly expresses misogynistic, racist, and authoritarian views had caused him to call into question everything he thought he knew about his spectacularly unrealistic, wholly imaginary conception of the nation he calls home. "I just can't believe that almost 60 million people would vote for someone who called immigrants rapists and attacked women and disabled people. The America [selectively constructed from my own experiences and personal values, and which only exists in my mind] that I love would never do that." At press time, Garlock's sentiments were reportedly echoed by all 1,273 of his Facebook friends.

Taylor Swift Enters Alternate Universe To Date Body-Building George Harrison
LOS ANGELES — In just the latest in a series of whirlwind romances, sources confirmed today that singer-songwriter Taylor Swift entered an alternate universe parallel to our own earlier this week and stepped out with famed English powerlifter George Harrison. "Taylor was spotted hand-in-hand with the former Mr. Universe on Tuesday night as the two entered West Hollywood restaurant Lucques," said US Weekly reporter Rebecca Kelly of the blossoming courtship between the 23-year-old recording artist and her new three-time Olympiad beau from a divergent plane of reality. "After dating guys like Harry Styles and Conor Kennedy, Taylor was probably looking for a more muscular hunk like George Harrison. Who can blame her for traveling outside the temporal and spatial dimensions of our world to be with him?" Swift's relationship with Harrison comes just weeks after the pop star had been spotted in a separate alternate universe with Seattle Seahawks running back Mohandas Gandhi.

White House Staff Frantically Shredding Trump Campaign Aides
WASHINGTON — In an effort to destroy as much incriminating evidence as possible following the indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, White House staffers reportedly spent Tuesday frantically shredding Trump campaign aides. "We should have done this months ago; we need to shred as many of these campaign aides as we can before Mueller gets his hands on them," said senior policy advisor Stephen Miller, who directed employees to search the White House and hand over any damning campaign consultants while he manned the industrial shredder, stopping occasionally to un-jam the machine. "Oh god, there's just so many of them. This could open us up to a lot of bad things. It's gonna take all day to destroy the staffers we have here, plus there's still a bunch in New York." At press time, Miller reportedly started a bonfire on the South Lawn after deciding it would be much faster to burn the enormous pile of campaign aides his team had collected.

Taylor Swift Mourns Death Of Boyfriend Christopher Dorner
BIG BEAR LAKE, CA — Another of Taylor Swift's high-profile romances came to an abrupt end Tuesday, sources confirmed, following the death of the recording artist's boyfriend and fugitive cop killer Christopher Dorner. "Taylor is absolutely heartbroken that her beau Christopher Dorner's charred remains were found in a mountain cabin after a lengthy shootout with police yesterday," wrote Radar Online blogger Amanda Snyder of the relationship between the 23-year-old pop-country singer and the 33-year-old quadruple homicide suspect, referring to the couple by their tabloid nickname "Swifner." "Just two days ago, fans snapped pictures of the snowy lovebirds nuzzling noses on the slopes while vacationing at Bear Mountain Resort. It's so sad — they were so cute together." At press time, sources reported that Swift was seen entering Los Angeles Police Department headquarters hand in hand with police chief Charlie Beck.

Pope Francis Renounces Papacy After Falling In Love With Beautiful American Divorcee
VATICAN CITY — Saying he could no longer fulfill his duties as the leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis officially renounced the papacy Monday after admitting that he had fallen in love with a beautiful American divorcee. "I cannot effectively complete my obligations as the Supreme Pontiff while also pursuing a relationship with my exquisite, perfect Linda," said the former Bishop of Rome, detailing his whirlwind romance with the 62-year-old CPA and recently divorced mother of three, whom he met while on a walking tour through the Piazza Navona. "Linda has given me the most spectacular two weeks I've ever experienced; we rode Vespas through the cobbled streets of Rome, shared gelato in the Campo de' Fiori, and tossed coins into the Trevi Fountain. That's why tomorrow, I will be moving into Linda's condo in Des Moines to start a new life with her. I worship the ground she walks on, and I want to devote the rest of my days to loving Linda." His ex-Holiness added that he was nervous about telling Linda that he's still a virgin and hopes she would let him take things slow.

Taylor Swift Accused Of Ripping Off Beyoncé By Giving Birth To Twins As Part Of Billboard Music Awards Performance
LAS VEGAS — Saying the pop superstar's opener felt strikingly familiar, music fans accused Taylor Swift of ripping off Beyoncé Wednesday when she gave birth to twins during her performance at the Billboard Music Awards. "Sure, Beyoncé doesn't own the copyright on pregnancy, but to the millions who watched last night as Taylor delivered a baby boy and girl onstage at the MGM Grand, it sure felt like plagiarism," wrote entertainment blogger Emily Brooks, who cited Swift's "total lack of creativity" in imitating Beyoncé so closely, from the birthing of fraternal twins right down to the ultimate decision to undergo an emergency C-section at her doctor's discretion. "I understand that great minds often think alike, but this was way over the line. Even the sound Taylor made during labor before being rushed into the NICU was basically a carbon copy. You can't just go around stealing other people's ideas — especially when you're stealing from the queen." Brooks added that it was particularly unscrupulous for Swift to bring Jay-Z out onstage and announce that she had named her newborn children Sir Carter II and Rumi Carter II.

Nation's Optimists Need To Shut The Fuck Up Right Now
WASHINGTON — Saying their rosy attitude about the state of the election was not helping anything given what is currently transpiring, sources confirmed Tuesday night that the nation's optimists need to seriously shut the fuck up as soon as humanly fucking possible. "Sure, things may look bad right now, but even if the worst happens, it's only four years we're talking about here," said Santa Fe, NM resident Pete Mirenge, one of hundreds of thousands of positive thinkers across the nation who would do everyone a huge goddamn favor by closing their fucking traps right this fucking second and keeping them sealed for the foreseeable future. "This is exactly why we have a system of checks and balances — to ensure that whatever happens in the election, the executive branch never gets too much power. Think about it: Has any president been able to carry out their platform to the letter? No. Nothing's ever as bad as it seems, believe me." According to sources, a calm and composed Mirenge — who reportedly has about five seconds before his mouth is shut for him — then added that the country's been through much worse and everything turned out okay.

Man Wearing 'Jewmerica' T-Shirt Never Dreamed He'd See This Day
SAND SPRINGS, OK — Feeling a mixture of intense pride and abject disbelief after news networks called the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump, local man Terry Williams, who is currently wearing a T-shirt adorned with the word "Jewmerica," told reporters late Tuesday night that he never dreamed he'd see this day during his lifetime. "This is so incredible — not in a million years did I think I'd ever get to watch a historic moment like this," said the unemployed 43-year-old, who has worn the T-shirt featuring the Star of David overlaid atop the United States flag throughout the 2016 election season as he closely followed Trump's campaign for the presidency and encouraged voters like him to head to the polls by writing regular posts on white nationalist forums. "I won't forget this feeling as long as I live. I'm so happy I might cry. Honestly, I've never been more proud to call myself an American." At press time, a visibly elated Williams was reportedly searching for his "Trump That Bitch" hat to wear while watching Hillary Clinton's concession speech.

"Taylor was absolutely crushed when her beau barricaded himself in a remote cabin and committed suicide, but after some intense soul-searching, she realized she couldn't live without him," Popsugar.com blogger Kristen Stern said of the rekindled romance between the 23-year-old singer-songwriter and the deceased subject of the LAPD's largest-ever manhunt. "Now the Swifner romance is back on! Fans caught the country cupcake canoodling with Christopher's burnt corpse at a San Bernardino County coroner's office this afternoon, and friends say she's planning a special Valentine's Day surprise for her man. She's definitely smitten." At press time, paparazzi photographed the couple cozying up together inside Dorner's body bag. This is an update to an earlier story.

'New York Times' Publisher Reveals Asking Trump To Decrease Anti-Media Rhetoric Except Against Those Fuckers At 'The Washington Post'
WASHINGTON — Citing the potential dangers of continued White House attacks on media outlets, New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger revealed Sunday that he asked President Trump to decrease his anti-media rhetoric during their July 20 meeting, excepting those made against "those fuckers at The Washington Post." "We urged him to back off of reporters and editors who are performing not just their jobs for their respective news organizations, but a valuable public service, and as members of a free press in a free country, should not have to feel their lives are at risk. I also entreated him to to join us in uniting against those WaPo shitasses," said Sulzberger, emphasizing that Washington Post journalists should not be exempt from being mercilessly ridiculed by Trump and anyone who consumes media. "Using the term 'fake news' is harmful for all non-Washington Post staffers involved and creates an unsafe adversarial atmosphere that should be reserved for enemies of our country, such as, say, all Washington Post staffers. If this borderline slander continues, it could conceivably lead to violence against respected and skilled journalists who work for credible media organizations, which of course excludes the Post. I think we left that meeting with a real understanding that Trump should tone it down a bit, and redirect his vitriol where it belongs, toward those Washington Post dumbfucks." At press time, Sulzberger believed Trump had listened to his arguments after learning that The Washington Post would be banned from all White House press briefings.

How To Talk To Your Child About The Election Results
Here's some advice for talking to your child about the shocking outcome of the 2016 presidential election: Children often understand more than we think, so start off by asking them if they have any idea what the fuck is happening. Put their mind at ease by confirming that the results of this election aren't the end of the world in any strictly literal sense. Don't be afraid to openly share your wine with them. Avoid touching on any topic that might be distressing to a young child, such as the electoral college. Reassure them that no matter what, the adults in their life will always feel obligated to tell them everything's going to be all right. Explain that testosterone is a naturally occurring steroid hormone that makes a person more aggressive and reactive. Remind them that one day when they're older, they'll understand all of this a lot better and will get to decide for themselves whether or not they should forgive us. Acquaint your daughter with the word "motherfucker" to equip her for what lies ahead. If they have additional questions, direct them to your Twitter feed.

Fox News Condemns 2020 Election As Partisan Witch Hunt Orchestrated By Democrats To Unseat President
NEW YORK — Calling the running and nomination of a candidate a blatant abuse of power from the left, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson condemned the 2020 election Thursday as a partisan witch hunt orchestrated by Democrats to unseat President Trump. "This is nothing more than a Soviet-style democratic election," said Carlson, adding that the timing of the election was especially suspicious, coming after Trump has already been in office for three years. "The millions of dollars spent on campaign ads and televised debates clearly point to some larger conspiracy being pushed by the left; it's a total coup! This poorly executed attempt to downplay the president's overwhelming electoral victory in 2016 with some sort of flimsy pretext to democracy is inexcusable and the exact type of threat our founding fathers warned us about. Frankly, it's unconstitutional and shameful to see Democrats stoop to such low levels." At press time, Democratic candidates had announced the suspension of their campaigns saying this kind of divisiveness was not what America needs right now.

20,000 Tons Of Pubic Hair Trimmed In Preparation For Valentine's Day
WASHINGTON — Flushed with anticipation and ready to emerge from another long, cold winter, millions of Americans participated this week in the annual tradition of trimming their pubic regions in time for Valentine's Day. A ritual as old as time itself, this year's pubis-shearing is expected to be among the largest in decades, with more than 20,000 tons of curly clippings predicted to fall by Feb. 14. "My boyfriend and I are going to see As You Like It and then enjoy a nice candlelit three-course dinner," said Brooklyn resident Lydia Simonson, who along with many other hopeful lovers will soon excuse herself from her daily duties, retreat to a nearby bathroom, and carefully tend to the area around her genitalia. "It's going to be so romantic!" Indeed, tiny scissors and electric razors have already begun to fly off drugstore shelves, while all across the country legs are dangling precariously over open bathtub drains. According to statistics from the National Depilatory Council, the week before Valentine's Day is by far the busiest time of the year for shaving, trimming, sculpting, playful pattern-making, waxing, and even manscaping. "David and I are going to take a long walk around the park and then maybe on the way home we'll stop and grab some ice cream," said Julie Stibbons, a Dallas-area design consultant who recently made use of grooming shears, a pair of tweezers, and two magnifying mirrors to contribute her 0.4 ounces to the nation's total raw tonnage. "I wonder if David will send me flowers at work like last year." Added Stibbons, whose smooth vaginal region will show no signs of stubble for days to come, "He's just so wonderful." While this year promises to be prolific, experts said the country has gone through many personal grooming phases over the years. In 1947, the first year records were kept, Americans only mowed about 1.25 tons off their "crotch lawns," while in the mid-1970s private trimmings were so rare that documentation was actually abandoned until 1981. But with the booming economy of the 1990s, the U.S. saw a significant resurgence in pre–Valentine's Day shearing and plucking. "There's a huge spike every year in the first half of February," said Brooks Watson, who is head of sales at Schick, makers of the TrimStyle razor for women. "The rest of the year, Americans generate about 50,000 tons of total trimmings, but in the week before this special holiday we see a massive jump. It's a veritable clear-cutting down there." "Bzzzzzzzz," he added. "Timber!" According to Schick's marketing research, during the Valentine's season, U.S. pubic hair removal rates briefly approach those of Brazil, traditionally the smoothest country on the planet. While Americans seem willing to chop it all off for their annual celebration of romance, personal trimming still varies by season, and plummets to levels almost as low as Greece's during the week of Thanksgiving. "If I trim the shrubs, the tree looks bigger," said Jeremy Wertz of Boise, ID, standing in front of his hall mirror with a pair of scissors taken from his employer's supply closet. "See? Worth the itching, if you ask me." While many consider the practice a time-honored tradition, not all Americans share Wertz's enthusiasm. "I'm not going to let corporate America dictate the date or time at which I choose to groom my genitals," said Denver resident Marcus Shannon, adding that Valentine's Day was "invented by the razor industry" to sell grooming devices. "If you really love somebody, you should shave your pubes year-round." Meanwhile, National Depilatory Council director Donna Spaulding said the sudden nationwide surge in follicular concern is understandable, but she urged caution. "We all want to look good and feel desirable, but it's important to keep things in perspective," Spaulding said. "In the end, you want people to love your pubic region for what's inside, not just for how it looks."

New Evidence Suggests God Also Had Incredibly Busty Daughter
ARABAH VALLEY, ISRAEL — In a discovery that biblical scholars say could alter our most fundamental understanding of Christianity, recently unearthed manuscripts suggest that in addition to His Son, Jesus Christ, God also had a daughter with absolutely humongous breasts. The documents, found in a cave near the Jordanian- Israeli border and estimated to have been composed circa A.D. 200, recount the life, teachings, and death of Jesus' well-endowed twin sister, Tammi of Nazareth. According to experts, the revelation points to a more dualistic conception of the divine, one with the male principle embodied in Jesus and the female principle represented by Tammi and her giant, heaving bazoingas. "It's a monumental shift," said Boston College religion professor Paul Ferber, claiming that the newly discovered texts are more significant than the Gospel of Judas or the Dead Sea Scrolls. "Tammi has single-handedly undercut the male hegemony we've come to associate with the Christian faith, and added an important new dimension to the holy scripture. "Also, the various sources are in clear agreement that Tammi had the most enormous jugs in all of Galilee," added Ferber, gesturing with his hands. "Seriously. Like, out to here. The existence of Tammi has caused scholars to reexamine the Trinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and replace it with a Quadrinity that includes the Daughter figure — though some, including Ferber, argue it should actually be reconstrued as "a five-way Quintinity, counting as two separate divine powers both of Tammi's bodacious watermelons. According to the manuscripts, written in Greek on papyrus scrolls, Tammi led a ministry contemporaneously with her brother's. Although she promulgated similar ideas concerning faith, humility, and forgiveness, and appeared to possess the same miraculous powers, Tammi seems to have had more difficulty communicating her message. In one passage, for example, her disciples repeatedly coax her into washing their feet, apparently for a better vantage point from which to observe her "heavenly radiance. " And while she, like Jesus, walks on water, the feat is described as almost disappointing to many onlookers, who had apparently hoped to see her run. Professor Ned McCormick of Duke Divinity School said a complete understanding of Tammi's teachings will require decades of research, with particularly close scrutiny given to the dozens of detailed illustrations. Explaining the difficulty of interpreting the texts, McCormick cited a passage that reads: "Saith Tammi, 'Consider ye this on the forgiveness of one's enemies: Let he who would slander you sup at your table, let he who would inflict…I saith unto thee: Look upon mine eyes, which dwell within mine head, and not upon mine bosom, wherein no wisdom dwells.' And then did Tammi snappeth her fingers together, saying, 'Seriously; I doth mean it. Up here.' "In all fairness to her disciples, it must have been impossible to concentrate with a couple of cannons like those in your face," McCormick said. "Especially in that desert heat, with nothing but a thin linen vestment between you and two of the most succulent milk-makers you've ever laid eyes on, beads of sweat slowly making their way down from her throat and running along the swells before descending into that perfect cleft between…oh my Lord." The circumstances surrounding Tammi's death are unclear, but the texts seem to suggest that while she was not crucified, she did, like her brother, die in Judaea, rise from the dead, and ascend bodily into heaven in her early 30s, well before her breasts would have begun to sag. While the documents make no direct mention of Tammi's participation in the Second Coming, Ferber said he would not be surprised if her followers held similar eschatological views and worshipped her as a kind of tandem messiah who would one day return to earth along with her brother, "her ginormous gazongas defying gravity as she descended bodily in glory from heaven" to establish the Kingdom of God. "Maybe I'm just being hopeful," Ferber said, "but I'd sure love to see those holy ta-tas with my own eyes.

American People Hire High-Powered Lobbyist To Push Interests In Congress
WASHINGTON — Citing a desire to gain influence in Washington, the American people confirmed Friday that they have hired high-powered D.C. lobbyist Jack Weldon of the firm Patton Boggs to help advance their agenda in Congress. Known among Beltway insiders for his ability to sway public policy on behalf of massive corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, Monsanto, and AT&T, Weldon, 53, is expected to use his vast network of political connections to give his new client a voice in the legislative process. Weldon is reportedly charging the American people $795 an hour. "Unlike R.J. Reynolds, Pfizer, or Bank of America, the U.S. populace lacks the access to public officials required to further its legislative goals," a statement from the nation read in part. "Jack Weldon gives us that access. "His daily presence in the Capitol will ensure the American people finally get a seat at the table," the statement continued. "And it will allow him to advance our message that everyone, including Americans, deserves to be represented in Washington." The 310-million-member group said it will rely on Weldon's considerable clout to ensure its concerns are taken into account when Congress addresses issues such as education, immigration, national security, health care, transportation, the economy, affordable college tuition, infrastructure, jobs, equal rights, taxes, Social Security, the environment, housing, the national debt, agriculture, energy, alternative energy, nutrition, imports, exports, foreign relations, the arts, and crime. Sources confirmed that Weldon is already scheduled to have drinks Monday with several members of the Senate Appropriations Committee to discuss saving the middle class. "If you have a problem, say, with America's atrocious treatment of its veterans, you can't just pick up a phone and call your local congressman," Weldon told reporters from his office on K Street Monday. "You need someone on the inside who understands how democracy works; someone who knows how to grease the wheels a little. Weldon said that after successfully advocating on behalf of Goldman Sachs and BP, he is relishing the opportunity to lobby for the American people, calling it the "challenge of a lifetime. " The veteran D.C. power player admitted that his new client is at a disadvantage because it lacks the money and power of other groups. "The goal is to make it seem politically advantageous for legislators to keep the American people in mind when making laws," Weldon said. "Lawmakers are going to ask me, 'Why should I care about the American people? What's in it for me?' And it will be up to me and my team to find some reason why they should consider putting poverty and medical care for children on the legislative docket. "To be honest," Weldon added, "the American people have always been perceived as a little naïve when it comes to their representative government. But having me on their side sends a clear message that they're finally serious and want to play ball. According to Washington heavyweights, hiring Weldon is an immediate game changer and should force politicians to take citizens' concerns seriously for the first time in decades. Moreover, sources said, Weldon will be able to help lawmakers see the American people as more than just a low-priority fringe group. "Jack is very good at what he does," said Joseph Pearlman, a headhunter for the McCormick Group who specializes in placing lobbyists. "He can take an issue that is nowhere on the congressional radar, like the pursuit of happiness, for example, and make it politically relevant. The next time Congress passes a bill dealing with civil rights or taxes, I wouldn't be surprised if the U.S. populace is mentioned somewhere in the final language. Though Weldon has only been on the job for three days, legislators have already seemed to take notice. "Before today, I'd actually never heard of this group," Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) told reporters. "But if Jack says they're worth my time, I'll take a look and see if maybe there are some areas where our interests overlap. "But I'm not making any promises," he added. "I'm a very busy man.

Local Water Tower Celebrates 50th Year As Repository Of Information On Who Is A Slut
CONCORDIA, MO — Residents marked the 50th anniversary of the Concordia water tower Tuesday, honoring a structure that for generations has been the community's most comprehensive source of information on who is a slut. According to University of Missouri historian Elliot Torcello, the remarkably well- preserved tower is recognized throughout the region as an indispensable archive detailing which women in the area are promiscuous, as well as whether or not they have crabs. "Since June 22, 1960, when the words 'Jill Hooper is a slut' first appeared on one of its support girders, the tower has been a place for citizens to go and find out who is really easy, or perhaps to contribute their own statement about who is giving it up all over town," Torcello said. "This unique public forum has immortalized the names of all those who demonstrated in one way or another that they were a slut, a whore, or — after 1984 — a skank. "One need only gaze upon the dozens of testimonials from the early 1970s on the size of Kelly Compitello's bush to realize what a truly remarkable record it is," Torcello added. The water tower, which services all of Lafayette County Public Utility District No. 3, is believed to offer the most extensive registry of Concordia's sluts, though local experts note that similar data can also be found on the big rock out by the train tracks and in the alleyway behind Champ's Sports Bar. While the 160-foot-tall structure catalogs a variety of information — including a definitive index of who is a fag or a queer and who has a limp dick — Torcello contends that it is the half-century-old compendium of Concordia's sluts and what they are willing to do with Principal Delahunt that offers the richest portrait of the town's history. "Take, for example, a 1964 message near the reservoir ladder, where in large red letters we can read that Cindy Davis takes it in the ass all night long," Torcello said. "Now, walk around to the south leg and you'll see words spray-painted some 23 years later that indicate her daughter, Becky Davis, takes it in the ass like a pro. That kind of insight into familial legacy is simply unprecedented. Continued Torcello, "Who knows what future generations may one day learn about Becky's own daughter, Tammy, and whether she, too, likes it in the ass? Previous scholars have noted the hierarchy represented on the water tower: The biggest sluts occupy the highest reaches of the edifice, their status announced in the largest, most brightly colored letters. Magnificently crowning the reservoir is a 3-foot-high neon-green message, dating from 1992 and easily visible from the highway, that heralds Tina Richmond's loose pussy. Though the veracity of the data appearing on structure has occasionally been called into question, officials maintained that the information is regularly updated to reflect the latest reports of who sucks dick, and who sucks even more dick. "It's a community bulletin board open to anyone," said Rachel Sorenson, president of the Concordia Historical Society. "Granted, there are a few outdated phone numbers on there, but when there's a mistake, someone will invariably cross out the wrong name and replace it with the right one. "In fact, the only completely inaccurate information I'm aware of is a message dating back to 1978 stating that 'Rachel Sorenson sucks cock behind the DQ,'" Sorenson added. Still, a number of Concordians resent the water tower's renown as a slut-identification tool, arguing that the public utility serves other, more important purposes than criticizing Jillian Knoll's titties. "They'll go on and on about who gave hand jobs to the entire state championship wrestling team in 1987, but they're frightfully ignorant of its more subtle insights," local resident Arthur Turner said. "Did you know that for 42 years, this tower has provided amazingly consistent affirmations of Zeppelin's ruling status? And it also features the region's finest collection of crudely drawn phalluses, both erect and flaccid — but no one is even aware of these things. Added Turner: "The underpass on Walker Street is right. This town is retarded.

Bryce Harper Asks If Phillies Willing To Move To Another City
PHILADELPHIA — Sending a strong signal that the move could swing his decision on where to sign, free agent outfielder Bryce Harper asked Friday whether the Philadelphia Phillies would be willing to relocate to another city. "I'm a big fan of coach [Gabe] Kapler and the roster he's assembled, but I'd love to see the Phillies make a big move to another city before I commit to playing for them," said the 2015 National League MVP, adding that he'd even be willing to sign at a lower salary if it would help the team relocate to someplace warm like San Jose or Orlando. "I'm really trying to put myself in the best position and it feels like the Phillies have all the pieces in place, except for the city. Playing with Jake [Arrieta] and Andrew [McCutchen] would be great, but in the end I would still be stuck in Philadelphia. But if they're able to guarantee they'll build a new stadium and move the franchise to Omaha, I'll sign tomorrow." Harper added that he might be willing to play in Philly if the city traded away the majority of its citizens.

YouTube Rushes To Shut Down School Shooter's Account Over Copyright Complaints
SAN BRUNO, CA — Following the Colorado school shooting that left one dead and eight others wounded, YouTube announced Thursday it had moved quickly to shut down the accounts of one of the suspects after receiving complaints over copyright violations. "Shortly after the heartbreaking events in Highlands Ranch, we took the action of removing all the suspect's videos in response to infringement claims made by copyright holders," said CEO Susan Wojcicki, who explained that when the names of the accused shooters were released, YouTube had taken the immediate precaution of freezing the suspect's account to ensure he wasn't disseminating any messages without distributing the proper royalties. "When we saw he shared a clip owned by NBCUniversal, we scrubbed this and all other copies from the platform within minutes. Spreading this kind of content on YouTube is simply unacceptable without first receiving the proper clearances. We don't want him inspiring others to violate intellectual property laws in similar ways." Wojcicki added that the company would consider reinstating his account if he agreed not to share any unlicensed music.

Children Of All Ages Delighted By Enslavement Of Topsy The Elephant
TUCSON, AZ — Cheers, laughter, and applause filled the big top tent at the Ringling Bros. Circus Saturday as children of all ages were captivated by the savage enslavement of Topsy the elephant. Whether young or just young at heart, thrilled audience members watched with glee as a circus trainer forced the frightened Topsy to perform tricks by brutally poking and prodding the traumatized 4-year-old pachyderm. "He's such a funny happy elephant," said 8-year-old Madison Helms, referring to the abused creature that spends the majority of his time chained up in a cramped, feces-covered enclosure. "He loves being in the circus! The crowd reportedly let out loud gasps and vigorously clapped when Topsy stood up on his hind legs, an unnatural and excruciatingly painful movement that stresses and permanently damages the 8,000-pound elephant's joints. Topsy also delighted the audience after the trainer repeatedly thrust a hooked rod into his skin, causing the miserable animal to lift one leg and his trunk to simulate waving. "Aww…" said the assembled circus-goers, who were taken by the cuteness of the barbaric spectacle. Branden Helger, 9, said Topsy was his favorite performer at Ringling Bros. because the elephant knew how to do neat tricks like pretending to limp. The third-grader also excitedly pointed out the "cool necklace" clamped on the animal's foot. Topsy and the other elephant performers, who are separated from each other at all times, preventing the socialization that's so crucial to their well-being, received a standing ovation from the crowd when they marched into the center ring, nervously rocking back and forth. "Look, they're dancing," said 5-year-old Jonah Meeks, mistaking the elephants' constant swaying for something that wasn't a maladaptive behavior caused by serious psychological trauma. "I can dance like an elephant, too. Look at me! Unaware that the elephant was terrified of the glaring stage lights, deafening crowd noise, and constant beatings, Phil Wingren, who brought his family to the circus, remarked that Topsy must relish being a star. "Boy, that Topsy's got it made," Wingren said to his children, referring to the mistreated, severely neglected creature, who is exposed to numerous diseases and receives no medical attention except when dirt is rubbed into his wounds to hide them from the public. "Always in the spotlight and everybody pampering you. That lucky elephant. "Look, he even has his own ball," continued Wingren, referring to the most hated object in Topsy's life. Attending the circus with her grandparents, Gretchen Anderson, 4, was delighted by Topsy and by the other pachyderms as well. "There's his mama," Anderson said of an elephant unrelated to Topsy, who has not seen his parents since being torn away from them shortly after birth, and last nestled up to his mother when he tried to suckle at her corpse shortly after poachers killed her. "They have a big happy family. Eyewitnesses who spotted the trainer patting the side of Topsy's body during the final trick were convinced the elephant and the man were best friends, though in fact the look of reverie on Topsy's face was the result of his daydreaming about stomping and crushing the cruel asshole's head like an overripe melon.

U.S. Government To Save Billions By Cutting Wasteful Senator Program
WASHINGTON — In an effort to reduce wasteful spending and eliminate non-vital federal services, the U.S. government announced plans this week to cut its long-standing senator program, a move it says will help save more than $300 billion each year. According to officials, the decision to cut the national legislative body was reached during a budget review meeting on Tuesday. After hours of deliberation, it was agreed that the cost of financing U.S. senators far outweighed the benefits they provided. "Now more than ever, we must eliminate needless spending wherever possible," President Obama said at a press conference Wednesday. "When we sat down to go over our annual budget, we asked ourselves, where can we safely trim back? What programs can we do away with without negatively impacting the American people? Which bloated and ineffective institutions can we no longer justify having around? "The answer was obvious," Obama added. "The U.S. Senate just needed to go. Established in 1789 as a means of overseeing the passage of bills into law, the once-promising senator program has reportedly failed to contribute to the governing of the nation in any significant way since 1964. Last year alone, approximately $450 billion was funneled into the legislative chamber, an amount deemed fiscally unsound considering how few citizens actually benefit in any way from its existence. In fact, the program has gone unchecked for so long that many in Washington are now unable to recall what purpose U.S. senators were originally meant to serve. "I'm sure when it was first introduced the U.S. Senate seemed like a worthwhile public service that would aid vast segments of the population and play an important role in the years to come," said Sheila McKenzie, president of the watchdog group the American Center for Responsible Government. "But in reality, this program has been a complete and utter failure. "It simply doesn't work," she added. "We've been pouring taxpayer dollars into this outdated relic for far too long. An analysis conducted last week revealed a number of troubling flaws within the long-running, heavily subsidized program, including a lack of consistent oversight, no clear objectives or goals, the persistent hiring of unqualified and selfishly motivated individuals, and a 100 percent redundancy rate among its employees. Moreover, the study found that the U.S. government already funds a fully operational legislative body that appears to do the exact same job as the Senate, but which also provides a fair and proportional representation of the nation's citizens and has rules in place to prevent one individual from holding the operations of the entire chamber hostage until he is guaranteed massive federal spending projects for his home state of Alabama. Not only have U.S. Senators cost the country billions of dollars in misspent funds over the years, but Washington insiders claim they have also derailed a wide range of other government programs, from social welfare to job creation to environmental protection. "Even just the space the Senate currently occupies could be put to better use," consumer advocate Michael Dodgerson said. "Were the government to open a day-care center, a homeless shelter, or even an affordable restaurant in that building, it would make more of a difference in the lives of everyday Americans than what's there now. So far, reaction to the cutback has been overwhelming positive, with many across the country calling it a long-awaited step toward progress. Still, a small pocket of the nation's populace vehemently disagreed with Tuesday's decision. "This is outrageous," said Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut-area resident and concerned citizen who makes more than $150,000 a year, enjoys full health care benefits, and lives comfortably in a large, non-foreclosed home. "The U.S. Senate has always looked out for my best interests. It's always done right by me. Added Lieberman, "Without it, I'll have no choice but to exploit my extensive connections in the real estate, legal, insurance, and pharmaceutical industries to obtain strictly honorary positions at large companies that, in exchange for my subservience over the years and the prestige of my name, will compensate me generously and allow me to continue living a privileged life without contributing even a moment of my time to the society that has made it all possible.

ESPN Showing Home Footage Of Young Harbaugh Brothers Coaching Together In Backyard
BRISTOL, CT — In part of the network's buildup to the much-anticipated "HarBowl," ESPN is showing viewers exclusively obtained home footage of Jim and John Harbaugh coaching together in their backyard as young boys, sources confirmed Friday."We thought it would be nice to give a glimpse into what these two phenomenal NFL coaches were like when they were kids and just coaching football in the yard without a care in the world," said SportsCenter executive producer Alex Durbin, adding that the old clips of the Harbaughs screaming play calls, managing the game clock, and slamming their Fisher-Price headsets to the ground after giving up touchdowns has already garnered a very positive response from ESPN viewers. "As you can see, back when Jim and John were 7 and 8, coaching football wasn't about winning championships. It was just about getting outside with friends and running up and down the sidelines until it was too dark to see the clipboard." Reached for comment, Jack Harbaugh told reporters that regardless of which team wins the Lombardi Trophy, he is simply proud that his sons never lost the childlike petulance they always had as young coaches.

Media Relieved They Don't Have To Deal With Fucking Harbaughs This Year
NEW YORK — Grateful to interview anyone but the two head coach brothers, members of the sports media expressed on Wednesday their unanimous, unequivocal relief that they didn't have to put up with those goddamn Harbaughs while covering this year's Super Bowl. "Thank fucking Christ," said NESN reporter Doug Kyed, adding that he "just could not handle" sitting through any more terse, hostile press conferences with that asshole Jim or pretending to care that John was always the supportive brother. "Compared to that god-awful Harbaugh shit, John Fox is nothing — he just shuts up and lets Peyton Manning go. Hell, even Carroll's fine. Give me Pete Carroll any day of the week if it means I never have to talk to another fucking Harbaugh again." Media personnel were reportedly further relieved after realizing they wouldn't have to watch Joe Flacco take a single snap on Sunday.

Scott Pruitt Claims Misappropriated EPA Funds Would Have Only Been Wasted On Dumb Shit Like Clean Water
WASHINGTON — Responding to criticism that he has repeatedly spent money intended for agency use on personal items, lavish travel, and other unnecessary expenditures, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt reportedly claimed Wednesday that the funds he has misappropriated would have only been wasted on dumb shit like clean water. "Everyone knows that the EPA would've just squandered these funds on stupid-ass stuff like providing potable water to a bunch of fucking kids or whatever if I hadn't used it first," said Pruitt, questioning why he should let the EPA fritter away American taxpayers' hard-earned cash on "useless bullshit" like fuel standards, maintaining air quality, and preventing contamination. "I just don't understand why people are getting all riled up about me taking personal trips on private jets or trying to get my wife a job at Chick-fil-A — do they seriously want me wasting my time appointing scientists to high-level posts or researching climate change? Ooh, yeah, let's piss away all our funding trying to uphold dumb crap like physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters, great idea. God, environmentalist people are so fucking lame." Pruitt added that it was bad enough the agency was throwing away a bunch of cash to clean up Superfund sites that had already been contaminated for free.

Pop Culture Expert Surprisingly Not Ashamed Of Self
LOS ANGELES — According to reports, 29-year-old online commentator Caroline Shelham is somehow not completely ashamed of her own well-established identity as a "pop culture expert. Shelham, who spends 10 hours every day consuming news updates on various entertainers and then commenting on their activities on an entertainment website, has reportedly shown no signs of humiliation or self-hatred over the way she spends the bulk of her time, and is also apparently not disgusted by the fact that this is actually what she does with her life. "Basically, I like to look at what's going on in pop culture and comment on it with a sort of fresh, wry voice," said Shelham, who by all accounts still possesses the ability to look at herself in the mirror every morning. "I try to find things that I think are really lame and vacuous and then just tear them apart. "I guess I see my role as being like an arbiter of what sucks and what doesn't in the world of show biz," added Shelham, seemingly under the sad impression that her work or existence has a meaningful use to society or the human race. "Somebody's got to do it. According to Shelham, this week alone she has penned what she refers to with a straight face as "news stories" about the separation of actors Courteney Cox and David Arquette; a photograph of the singer Rihanna wearing a new outfit; and an advertisement for an upcoming episode of a television sitcom, all of which she was surprisingly willing to take credit for having written and disseminated. She also composed a scathing, 800-word critique of the upcoming motion picture Burlesque that she suggested, with actual pride, was "some of [her] best work. "I'm sorry, but it might be just about time for [Burlesque actress] Cher to go away now," wrote Shelham, who does not seem to find anything self-degrading in the fact that she earns a living by deriding people she does not, nor will ever, know. "I know you're doing your best to make us forget that we actually found you charming in Moonstruck, but let's just call it a day already, shall we? Shelham — the daughter of a small business owner and a retired nurse who paid for her to attend a liberal arts college — recently spent a large portion of what in her mind is somehow a day's work creating an itemized list entitled "10 Things I Hate About This Season Of Dancing With The Stars" that she accepted money for writing and allowed to be published without apologizing to her loved ones for the despicable action. She was also among the first to find out that Ian Ziering is expecting a baby — a fact that she remains inexplicably proud of having learned nearly 14 hours before the general public. "Why in the name of God would anybody even pay attention to Jessica Simpson anymore? " she recently asked without any sudden pangs of overwhelming regret or self-loathing. "I think it's high time somebody told her that nobody cares. Though Shelham is an actual human being, her choice to intentionally put effort toward commenting on actor Kelsey Grammer's love life and the televised interactions of a group of New Jersey twentysomethings has evidently not caused her to contemplate the act of suicide. "Say what you will about Perez Hilton's tackiness, but you have to respect what he's built," she said. "You know, I did a parody of him once? Kim Kardashian re-tweeted it.

Cubs Pitching Coach Forced To Clean Up Trembling, Piss-Covered Pitchers After Leaving Them Locked In Bullpen All Day
ST. LOUIS — Spraying down the traumatized players who were standing in puddles of their own excrement, Chicago Cubs pitching coach Tommy Hottovy was forced to clean up a group of trembling, piss-covered pitchers Friday after leaving them locked inside the bullpen all day. "God, I feel so bad that they were trapped in there without anyone to open the gate and let 'em run around," said Hottovy, lamenting that the pitchers had scratched up the walls and chewed through all of the catcher's mitts. "I totally spaced after the game yesterday and left them cooped up without any water or anything. I can tell by the look in their eyes that they don't trust me anymore. Once I opened the gate, a few them just sprinted out and took a huge shit in right field." At press time, Hottovy was attempting to console a whimpering Craig Kimbrel who had spent the entire game curled up in the corner of the bullpen.

Dirty, Disheveled Scott Pruitt Confesses He Spent Last Of EPA Funding Weeks Ago
WASHINGTON — Rocking back and forth in his chair and openly weeping, a dirty, disheveled EPA administrator Scott Pruitt confessed during testimony before the House Appropriations committee Thursday that he had spent the last of his department's funding weeks ago. "It's gone, all gone, every penny of it — poof, just like that," said an unkempt Pruitt, sobbing as he revealed that he'd spent the entirety of his agency's $5.6 billion budget in a matter of weeks before grabbing the jacket sleeve of Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN) and begging her to forgive him for being "such a huge fuckup." "I pissed it all away on stupid shit, all right? Ever since I spent the last $800,000 or so around the beginning of March, the EPA hasn't had two nickels to rub together. Now, I've got all kinds of sub-departments breathing down my neck wondering where all the funding is, and I've just been pretending we're solvent and trying to hide from everyone. I'm sorry, I just got so greedy." Sources reported that as the hearing came to a close, an increasingly shifty Pruitt asked committee members if there was an inconspicuous side door he could exit through, since there are a lot of people looking for him.

Beto O'Rourke's Son Concerned Trump Will Order Ukraine To Investigate Him Next
EL PASO, TX — Worrying over whether he had ever engaged in any activity that might hurt his father's candidacy, Henry O'Rourke, the 8-year-old son of White House hopeful Beto O'Rourke, expressed concern Tuesday that President Trump might instruct Ukraine to investigate him next. "What if those Ukrainian guys find out about that time last year I got my recess privileges taken away for acting up in class?" the visibly panicked third-grader said as he repeatedly searched beneath his bed and inside his closet to make sure there weren't any unfinished school assignments or other incriminating materials that could be used against him or his father. "I don't think I've done anything too bad, but I'd better cover my tracks just in case. Oh God — there is that time I copied my friend Tyler's math homework! It only happened once, though, and I don't think he'll talk. Still, they went after Hunter [Biden], and it's only a matter of time before they start digging up dirt on me." The young O'Rourke added that he was glad his father never gained enough influence in Congress for anyone to ever accuse him of abusing his power for his son's benefit.

Breaking New Ground: Beto O'Rourke Has Become The First Presidential Candidate Available As A 'Smash Ultimate' DLC Fighter
Watch out, Smash players! A new foe has appeared. The Beto O'Rourke campaign just broke new ground recently by making Beto the first presidential candidate available as a Super Smash Bros. Ultimate DLC fighter. The former Texas congressman and gubernatorial candidate will become the 83rd character to join the all-star roster of combatants. According to his description on the Nintendo Game Store, he's available for only $5.99 in a package that includes his own stage in an El Paso diner along with five musical tracks inspired by his work in the post-hardcore band Foss. His default costume is a blue oxford shirt, but it looks like he has three alternatives consisting of the same shirt with the sleeves rolled up to different lengths! "We at Beto For America aren't afraid to try new things, and we think making Beto a Smash character is a great way to reach out to younger voters and get them excited about his run for the presidency," said Jen O'Malley Dillon, Beto's campaign manager, explaining how they worked in partnership with Nintendo to create an avatar whose abilities and move-set reflect the politician's character and policies. "Our hope is that watching Beto duke it out with Meta Knight and Samus will familiarize millennials in this country with everything this candidate represents." "As a campaign working to fix a broken America, we pride ourselves on going to spaces other candidates wouldn't consider, and Smash is definitely the next frontier," she added. In terms of playability, Beto boasts an array of versatile special attacks, such as throwing Whataburgers, bashing opponents with a guitar, and plowing through enemies while riding a skateboard. His Final Smash is pretty cool, too, with Beto starting by getting up on a table and body slamming his opponent. It's hard to land, but if done successfully, it's an instant K.O. As for his taunts, he can call for his enemies' impeachments as well as insulting them in Spanish. Overall, we would rank him as a third-tier character, between Bowser Jr. and King Dedede. Although he has only been out for a short while, we're already hearing that Beto is proving to be an extremely popular character, with most readers choosing him as a CPU opponents so that they can spend hour after hour just endlessly wailing on him.

Gay Teen Worried He Might Be Christian
LOUISVILLE, KY — At first glance, high school senior Lucas Faber, 18, seems like any ordinary gay teen. He's a member of his school's swing choir, enjoys shopping at the mall, and has sex with other males his age. But lately, a growing worry has begun to plague this young gay man. A gnawing feeling that, deep down, he may be a fundamentalist, right-wing Christian. "I don't know what's happening to me," Faber admitted to reporters Monday. "It's like I get these weird urges sometimes, and suddenly I'm tempted to go behind my friends' backs and attend a megachurch service, or censor books in the school library in some way. Even just the thought of organizing a CD-burning turns me on. Added Faber, "I feel so confused. The openly gay teen, who came out to his parents at age 14 and has had a steady boyfriend for the past seven months, said he first began to suspect he might be different last year, when he started feeling an odd stirring within himself every time he passed a church. The more conservative the church, Faber claimed, the stronger his desire was to enter it. "It's like I don't even know who I am anymore," the frightened teenager said. "Keeping this secret obsession with radical right-wing dogma hidden away from my parents, teachers, and schoolmates is tearing me apart. According to Faber, his first experience with evangelical Christianity was not all that different from other gays his age. "Sure, I looked at the Book of Leviticus once or twice — everybody has," Faber said. "We all experiment a little bit with that stuff when we're growing up. But I was just a kid. I didn't think it meant anything. Faber's instinct was to deny these early emotions. But recently, the Louisville teen admitted, the feelings have grown stronger, making him wonder more and more what life as a born-again right-wing fundamentalist would be like. "The other week, I was this close to picketing in front of an abortion clinic," the mortified teenager said, his eyes welling up with tears. "I know it's wrong, but I wanted so badly to do it anyway. I even made one of those signs with photos of dead fetuses and hid it in my closet. I felt so ashamed, yet, at the same time, it was all strangely titillating. Faber's parents, although concerned, said they're convinced their otherwise typical gay son is merely going through a conservative Christian phase. "I caught him watching The 700 Club once when he thought he was alone in the house, and last week, I found some paperbacks from the Left Behind series hidden in his sock drawer," his mother, Eileen Faber, said. "I'm sure he'll grow out of it, but even if he doesn't, I will love and accept my son no matter what. Faber's father was far less tolerant in his comments. "No son of mine is going to try to get intelligent design into school textbooks," Geoffrey Faber said. "And I absolutely refuse to pay his tuition if he decides to go to one of those colleges like Oral Roberts University where they're just going to fill his head with a lot of crazy conservative ideas. He added, "I just want my normal gay son back.

Child Shown Field Where Cubs Suck
CHICAGO — Visiting for the first time in his young life, 9-year-old Jacob Tendering was reportedly shown the field where his favorite team, the Chicago Cubs, suck every home game of the year, sources confirmed Wednesday. "That's the place where all the shittiness happens," said the child's father, Lee Tendering, adding that the Cubs have been fucking up at Wrigley Field for almost 100 years. "Your grandpa used to take me here to watch the Cubs suck when I was a boy, and hopefully someday you'll bring your son here to watch the Cubs suck." At press time, Jacob's father was fondly recalling how it was much cheaper to watch the Cubs suck back then.

Conspiracy Theory Wastes No Time Getting Racist
CARSON CITY, NV — Remarking at the social media user's ability to immediately cut to the chase, sources confirmed Monday that a conspiracy theory posted on Reddit wasted absolutely no time getting racist. "Man, this guy didn't even spend a complete sentence describing the cabal of globalists controlling world affairs before going full-tilt with this stuff about 'Jew bankers' and 'intellectual inferiority,'" reported sources, noting that conspiracy theorists usually have the decency to make you read between the lines with references to George Soros or bankers, but this one just jumped warp-speed into calling out the "mongrelization" of the United States genetic pool. "For Christ's sake, he could have at least buried some of these slurs. I'm only a few paragraphs in and he's straight-up listing off the science of race. Honestly, I'm kind of insulted this guy doesn't have enough faith in me to pick up on why 'Western Civilization needs defending.' " The sources also stressed that despite the manifesto's lack of nuance, it did make a few pretty good points.

Congress Puts Aside Partisan Differences For Good Of Military Contractors
WASHINGTON — Explaining the rationale behind a two-year government budget deal crafted by members of both parties hours ahead of a potential shutdown, congressional leaders told reporters Thursday that they had put aside their partisan differences for the good of the nation's military contractors. "It's time that we stop bickering with each other over minor political disputes and start standing up for the brave defense contractors who keep us safe," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), echoing the sentiments of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other congressional leaders as they championed the bipartisan spending increases that would provide billions of much-needed government subsidies to U.S. military companies. "We may not always see eye to eye, but both Democrats and Republicans recognize how important it is to put politics aside when we're talking about the men and women in our private military sector." Senate leaders also expressed their satisfaction that the two parties could set aside their partisan disagreements to ensure that the bill did absolutely nothing to push for immigration reform.

World's Leading Scientists Nervously Stand Next To Poster-Board Displays As Nobel Committee Walks Through Gymnasium
STOCKHOLM — Anxiously awaiting critiques from the judges, the world's leading scientists nervously stood next to their poster-board displays Thursday as the Nobel Committee made its way through a gymnasium, inspecting their projects. "I stayed up all night cutting out stenciled letters, mounting my results on construction paper, and using glue stick to get these cryo-electron microscope images onto my poster board," said molecular biologist Richard Henderson, eyeing his competitors' various displays of wind tunnels, volcanoes, and mathematical models illustrating the exponential expansion of space following the Big Bang. "The competition's pretty serious this year. I saw one of the other scientists dropping Mentos into a two-liter bottle of Coke, and it looked pretty cool. Meanwhile, one of my graphs describing the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules fell off my poster right as the committee was walking by. I really hope that's not going to affect my chances of winning the Nobel Prize." At press time, sources confirmed theoretical physicist and cosmologist Alan Guth had been disqualified after the committee concluded his parents had clearly done most of the work for him.

NBC Details Inspirational Story Of Sponsor's Journey To Olympics
RIO DE JANEIRO — Chronicling what many have called the most touching and incredible narrative of the Rio Games, NBC aired a special feature Monday about the inspirational story of Bridgestone's journey to the 2016 Olympics. "It's been such a long road, and at times it seemed impossible, but we never gave up, and now we're here in Rio alongside all the biggest brands in the world," Bridgestone CEO Masaaki Tsuya said during the three-minute NBC piece, adding that he always believed the 85-year-old auto manufacturer's logo could someday be on the Olympic medal podium in front of billions of consumers around the world. "You know, everyone always used to say we were too small, or that our marketing team wasn't experienced enough, but we proved them wrong. It just goes to show that any brand, no matter where they're headquartered or how strong their sales are, can defy the odds and achieve the Olympic dream. We're proof of that." Tsuya went on to credit Heineken's incredible commercial performance during the 2012 London Games for inspiring Bridgestone to set its sights on the Olympics.

Juror Way Too Far Into Trial To Ask What 'Contusions' Are Now
RESTON, VA — Noting that attorneys on either side had used the term dozens of times during the previous two weeks, juror Michael Kerr told reporters Monday that he was too far into a capital trial at this point to ask what "contusions" are. "When the prosecutor first brought it up, I thought I could just ignore it and hope it wouldn't come up again, but then they called in a medical expert who said it a whole bunch of times," Kerr said after the witness delivered testimony on the victim's numerous contusions, which he surmised could refer to strands of hair, bones, or another part of the body, but could be something different altogether. "I've been looking at people's faces whenever contusions come up, and I can tell by their expression that it's something bad, but that's the only clue I've got. The next time they say it I'm probably just going to nod." Kerr said he planned to look up the term as soon as he got home after voting for a guilty verdict.

WASHINGTON — Admitting they had just assumed the candidate was some kind of quirky billionaire or one of those CEOs who runs for president just to raise his profile, all 325 million Americans expressed horror Tuesday upon learning Cory Booker was a sitting U.S. senator. "He's an elected official? In the United States Senate?" said Cleveland resident Sonja Burke, echoing the sentiments of the entire American populace after she was told Booker — who once fabricated a story about meeting a drug dealer named T-Bone — was viewed as a prominent Democrat. "Huh. I've been laughing at all the dumb stuff he says, but now that I know he's been a senator for years, it's not so funny. And apparently he was mayor of Newark? That's a pretty good-sized city. Yikes." At press time, Americans reportedly let out a collective gasp after discovering Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Kirsten Gillibrand were also already senators.

No One On SWAT Team Wants To Wait In Ventilation Duct With Howard
CHICAGO — A Chicago Police Department Special Weapons And Tactical unit was called to the scene of an ongoing hostage situation at Green Oaks Psychiatric Hospital at approximately 2:30 p.m. today, and as the standoff entered its fifth hour, the SWAT team was no closer to determining whose turn it was to sit in the ventilation duct with Sr. Cpl. Howard Simmons. "No way — I just had him on that meth-ring bust we did last week," said Officer Pat Toman, a surveillance specialist who finds Simmons' habit of taking his shoes off on long stakeouts particularly disgusting. "We had to sit in a cramped van listening to phone conversations for 12 hours. Every time the suspects would pick up the phone, he would go, 'Shh! We're on.' Every time! It's like, Howard, I wasn't even talking. Before ordering his men into the facility's airway system, Sgt. Matt Lamarre briefed them on the building's layout and directed them to kill the suspect on sight. SWAT officers then began a tournament of rock- paper-scissors to determine who would follow Simmons, and his penchant for biting his fingernails and then flicking them at the wall, into the ventilation duct. "In a multiple-hostage situation like this, my men have to be ready for anything," Lamarre said. "For example, Howard could make that clicking noise with his tongue when he's thinking, or he could tell that same corny joke about how he 'wonders if Domino's will deliver a large pepperoni with extra cheese up to this vent.' I got stuck on a rooftop with him a month ago, and with no prompting he acted out about 20 minutes of Napoleon Dynamite. And he wasn't even quoting the lines right. "Don't get me wrong, he's a decent guy and all, and he's saved my life twice, but come on, Howard, shut up about all your boring hobbies for once," added Lamarre, who later volunteered himself for battering ram duty upon learning that Howard had recently taken a kite-building class. "He just goes on and on and on. Makes me want to shoot somebody. Howard Simmons, a 19-year Chicago Police Department veteran and self-proclaimed "lethal gas specialist," has served on the elite tactical unit since 2003, during which time he has had dozens of anonymous complaints lodged against him by fellow officers for offenses ranging from the "smelly tea he drinks," to always needing to borrow a riot shield, to excessive humming of the Sanford And Son theme song during high-risk operations. Over half of the complaints included a reference to Simmons' chosen code name, "Basilisk." "Do you have any idea how difficult it is to whisper the word 'Basilisk' over a walkie- talkie? " read one complaint, filed last June. "And when he answers, he always says 'Mmmyeeees?' in this stupid voice. So annoying. Despite receiving numerous verbal warnings about his attempts to start a "special SWAT team handshake," Howard Simmons still ranks highest in his division in both kill shots and speed of suspect apprehension. In one particularly impressive maneuver last month, Howard diffused a barricade situation within 20 minutes, arrested the criminals single-handedly, and much to the chagrin of the officer assigned to the mission with him, winked and said "Book 'em, Dan-O," just like he always does after successfully bringing down an international prostitution ring. As of press time, Officer Simmons has reportedly entered Green Oaks Hospital's ventilation system alone. SWAT team officials said they could not divulge any specifics about his location to the public, as they did not provide him with a headset.

Nation's Girlfriends Admit Absolutely Everything Riding On Valentine's Day
WASHINGTON — Confirming that it's "all come down to this," the nation's girlfriends admitted Thursday that, despite anything they may have said or implied in the past, absolutely everything hinges on the outcome of this Valentine's Day. Describing the evening as "the indisputable make-or-break moment of our relationships," the girlfriends explained that if Valentine's Day fails, in any way, to live up to their standards, or if at any point they sense that not enough effort went into the occasion, then things are as good as over. "Look, I'm gonna cut the shit here: I've basically funneled all my hopes for the future into this one night in which my boyfriend must achieve perfection, or else we're through," Virginia Beach area girlfriend Jenna Boyce, 27, told reporters, noting that she will be able to tell immediately if her boyfriend cheaps out on the flowers he has bought her or throws his gift together at the very last minute. "I expect an amazing, thoughtful, nearly flawless experience, one that is simultaneously fun and romantic, and a night I will remember for the rest of my life. Anything short of that, and I walk." "I know I've stated in the past that I believe Valentine's Day is dumb and that it's a commercial holiday and that it doesn't matter to me, but I was lying," Boyce added, in total concurrence with every other girlfriend in the country. "That was total horseshit. I, in fact, care more about this than anything, by far." The nation's girlfriends admitted to reporters, and to anyone who cared to know, that nothing their boyfriends have ever done for them in the past, including any and all good deeds previously rendered, will matter in the slightest if they don't make tomorrow a day to remember. The assembled women then confirmed that they expect the following things tomorrow, and they "don't give one flying fuck" if these expectations make them appear either old-fashioned, demanding, or unrealistic: flowers; repeated romantic gestures and signs of physical affection; compliments; assorted gifts of an emotionally resonant nature; a dinner that is sufficiently high-end yet also warm and intimate; two to three fond recollections of the relationship's origins; an outfit and attention to personal dress on the part of the boyfriend that shows he cares; extended eye contact; highly engaged conversation; no spared details; no mistakes; no jokes that in any way undermine the seriousness and romantic gravity of the evening; no mention of money or cost; and a minimum of 25 utterances of the word "love." "And if you don't like it, that is too fucking bad, because this is the attitude I am walking into tomorrow with and there is nothing you or anyone else can do to alter or subdue that attitude," said Seattle area girlfriend Sonia Moreno, 31, noting that Valentine's Day will be the sole metric she will use to gauge her boyfriend's worth and romantic commitment. "That's the reality. It's all come down to this. And so, come tomorrow, I suppose myself and every girlfriend in America will find out for sure if their relationship has a future or not." The nation's girlfriends also confirmed that if their boyfriends are able to go all out and make tomorrow truly special, then there is no reason why they couldn't make a similar effort on every other day of the year too.

Both Parties Acting Exactly How Everyone Expected Them To Restore Nation's Faith In Political Process
AKRON, OH — As President Donald Trump's impeachment trial ended with an acquittal in the Senate, sources confirmed Friday that both parties acting exactly how everyone expected them to had restored the nation's faith in its political process. "Watching the Democrats cower behind ineffectual high-minded rhetoric while the Republicans manipulated every procedure and spouted dangerous propaganda really affirmed my belief that today's U.S. government is working exactly as intended," said 43-year-old retail manager Aaron Bennett, echoing the sentiments of 325 million Americans who confirmed that although the impeachment trial had shaken their faith in their leaders, watching the Democrats belatedly pursue a narrow goal that resisted meaningfully challenging any structural issues, only to let themselves be easily obstructed by Republican leaders committed to holding power regardless of the consequences, offered sorely needed reassurance of the strength of the U.S. political system. "I was really worried impeachment indicated that the American way of life for the last several decades was at risk. I admit I even doubted whether our institutions could survive several Republicans deviating from their cynical embrace of an obvious criminal in order to further their callous agenda. The idea that Democrats were actually trying to pursue a moral objective instead of just using moral rhetoric as a smokescreen for accumulating influence really shook me. I'm just grateful that both parties were able to move past their differences and work together to uphold the American political system as we know it." The relieved nation added that it would have been devastating if the Senate removed Trump, which would fly in the face of what the founding fathers wanted when they inscribed the principle of a few rich men shielding each other from accountability into the nation's Constitution.

Congress Confused By $500 Million In Trump's Budget Allocated For 'Laser Stuff'
WASHINGTON — As they examined the recently released White House budget, U.S. senators and representatives expressed confusion Tuesday about the $500 million that President Trump has proposed the government spend on "laser stuff" in fiscal year 2019. "While I agree with many of the president's recommendations, like his proposed cuts to entitlement programs, I have to admit I'm somewhat baffled by the lines in this budget dedicated to 'state-of-the-art zap-beams,' 'powerful ray shooters,' and 'high-tech glowing red dots,'" said Sen. Todd Young (R-IN), voicing concerns shared by members of Congress in both parties who sought further clarification about Trump's plan to subsidize the development of "blue, green, blue-violet, neon yellow, and other lightning-fast colors of laser beams." "I've long advocated for increased military spending, but as a Marine Corps veteran myself, I'm not convinced 'extra-large laser cannons' and 'bright lights that blast you so hard it really hurts' are what our armed services really need from us right now." At press time, both houses of Congress reportedly agreed to the allocations after White House aides explained that any funds appropriated for "laser stuff" would be handed over in a lump sum to the nation's defense contractors.

Climate Scientists Confirm There's Still Time To Blow Up The Earth
GENEVA, SWITZERLAND — Warning that millions would starve in the streets unless world leaders took decisive action, scientists representing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed Monday that there was still time left to blow up the Earth before irreversible global warming condemned humanity to slow extinction. "By destroying our planet in a nuclear maelstrom now, we can prevent the undue suffering that will otherwise characterize the next century," said IPCC chairman Hoesung Lee, adding that a mere thousand nuclear weapons strategically placed at crucial active geothermal sites across the globe might be enough to inundate the planet in white-hot magma, putting a merciful end to the failed experiment known as man. "We have the technology to do this, but it won't be easy, and we have to act immediately. We believed we'd have at least another century to blow up the Earth, but if the human race is to prevent ecological catastrophe, we need to start yesterday. I, for one, don't want to have to look my grandchildren in the eyes someday and say I could have blown up the hellish world they're forced to inhabit but chose not to. That would be the height of selfishness." Lee then presented a series of terrifying mockups of satellite images depicting what a tragically intact Earth might look like in 2040 and beyond.

Climate Researchers Warn Only Hope For Humanity Now Lies In Possibility They Making All Of This Up
GENEVA — Saying the time to act has come and gone, a group of researchers from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned Tuesday that any hope for the future of humanity now hinges on the possibility that scientists like themselves are simply making all of this up. "After reviewing our climate models and projections of worldwide CO2 emissions, we have come to the conclusion that the only scenario in which the human race survives is if our thousands upon thousands of meticulous empirical studies on climate change turn out to be something we've been lying about all along," said climate scientist Philip Vanderwall, who stated that unless the entire scientific community has spent the past 50 years falsifying reams of data as part of a coordinated disinformation campaign to sabotage the global economy, the world's low-lying coastal regions are as good as done for. "The evidence indicates our planet still might stand a chance of averting a complete climate catastrophe as long as my colleagues and I belong to a cabal of charlatans who are secretly paid huge sums of money to trick everyone into believing excess greenhouse gases will precipitate record-breaking natural disasters and worldwide famine. Otherwise, we're all doomed." On a personal note, Vanderwall added that he hopes that one day, his grandchildren will discover that he was involved in a massive, nefarious conspiracy spanning every country on the face of the earth, because it is the only thing that can possibly save them.

Relationship Experts Say Mailing Body Part To Ex On Valentine's Day Only Way To Win Them Back
BOSTON — Claiming that the simple but thoughtful act was an excellent way to rekindle lost love, relationship experts confirmed Wednesday that mailing a body part to an ex on Valentine's Day was the only way to win them back. "Our research revealed that anyone hoping to successfully reignite an old flame should lop off an extremity and ship it first-class to a former lover," said sociologist Dr. Margot Durlauf, who recommended artfully arranging ears or fingers in a romantic collage rather than just hacking them off and carelessly dumping the bloody parts into a package. "Even just a little toe can go a long way to convincing the one that got away that you've been thinking about them and want them back in your life. Many couples who reunited claimed that receiving a severed hand immediately brought the couple back together and made their relationship stronger than ever before." Durlauf added that giving a personal detached limb had a higher likelihood of successfully wooing a past sweetheart than just simply buying one.

Encouraged Marine Biologists Project Oceans Will Be Nice, Simmering Seafood Bisque By 2040
KINGSTON, RI — Explaining that their recent findings indicated that climate change would have some positive effects on the environment, encouraged marine biologists at the University of Rhode Island projected Tuesday that the planet's oceans will be a nice, simmering seafood bisque by 2040. "Within the next 20 years or so, we expect that global temperatures will have increased to the point that the majority of the ocean will be a delicious, hearty broth filled with perfectly cooked chunks of octopus, crab, and dolphin," said marine biologist Carol Degner, adding that as long as humanity continues to warm the Earth at its current rate, people would be able to run down to almost any coastline on the planet with a ladle and a warm crust of garlic bread to dine on the bubbling, creamy dish. "Obviously, the soup's contents will vary by geography — we'll be seeing more swordfish and king mackerel in the Atlantic soup, lots of angel sharks and halibut in the Pacific soup, and some delicacies like slow-cooked walrus from the Arctic soup region. We suggest preparing for it by commandeering boats to travel out into the ocean now and start sprinkling in red pepper flakes or cajun seasoning so that by 2040, the ocean really hits the spot. The only real downside is that humanity may quickly deplete the planet's supply of bread bowls." The marine biologists did warn, however, that if the soup ends up being too good, it could lead to sea levels dropping precipitously.

EPA Administrator Proves Carbon Emissions Not Harmful By Inhaling Directly From Truck's Tailpipe
WASHINGTON — During a press conference held in a D.C. parking lot, Environmental Protection Agency head Andrew Wheeler went out of his way Friday to show carbon emissions were safe by putting his mouth over the exhaust pipe of an idling Jeep Grand Cherokee and taking several deep breaths. "Despite all the fear-mongering on behalf of politically motivated scientists, carbon emissions are not harmful in any way, as you can see," said a coughing, unsteady Wheeler, moments before he was seen vomiting, losing his balance, and collapsing onto the pavement. "They pose no threat at all to the American public, and any hysterical claims to the contrary have no basis in reality. Sure, it does burn the lungs a little, but it doesn't cause any serious harm to internal organs — look, I'll even take another puff. Oh, God. Oh, God. Someone help me." At press time, local authorities had confirmed Wheeler's death.

If Wanting To See Vaginas Is A Crime, Then I, Your Honor, Am Guilty
I stand before you today accused of wrongdoing, with my reputation called into question before the entire community. But in truth, I am no more guilty of a crime than any other man in this courtroom. Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I say today on behalf of all mankind: If wanting to see vaginas is a crime, then I am guilty of that crime. And if going to great lengths to find unblinded windows or drill peepholes through which vaginas may be plainly observed elevates that crime from a misdemeanor to a multi-count felony, then I plead no contest. But before you pass judgment on me, look into your own hearts. Is there a man among us, here in this hall of so-called "justice," that does not also desire to see vaginas? Does any one of you not admire their natural, flowerlike perfection, or not enjoy the sexual urges they conjure deep within your being? Then why drag me into this august chamber and put my future in jeopardy for wanting nothing but the same? The only difference between us is that I acted upon the conviction of my beliefs, whereas you stood by and did nothing. And, in doing nothing, missed out on seeing a lot of amazing vaginas. Is not the pursuit of happiness a fundamental right promised by our nation's own Declaration of Independence? Well, what could make any man happier than to see a myriad of young vaginas, in a group shower, lovingly hand-lathered to a state of moist, soapy perfection? Is that not what our founding fathers themselves envisioned so many years ago? Yet here in this courtroom, we act as if the glory of the vagina is something to be hidden from public view. And in so doing, we veil the most rapturous wonder of creation under ignorance, repression, hosiery, and outerwear. Not unlike the conservative poly-knit skirt worn by the prosecuting attorney, who, I might add, is a very attractive woman. Have we as a society really come to the point where it is a crime for a man in a ski mask and black coveralls to place a simple ladder against the side of a building and climb his way to a vantage point from which the glorious beauty of the nude vagina can be gazed upon with the rapt wonderment it deserves? Where the mere act of placing hidden cameras in a dorm lavatory is to be looked down upon in hypocritical shame? Where even something so innocent as the posting of live streaming feeds on the Internet — so that all men, regardless of race, creed, or color, may share in the beauty of these vaginas — is somehow considered "wrong"? As long as we're at it, why don't we put every man who desires to see the vaginas of unknown women on some kind of national database and make him go door to door telling all of his neighbors, "I like vaginas! I like vaginas! As far as I am concerned, a world that denies a man's God-given right to stare directly at the genitalia of any woman he so desires is not a world worth living in. If you are going to sit there and tell me it is illegal in America to look at women in various states of undress, without their knowledge or consent, even when one is perfectly willing to expose his own genitals to the women in return, then go ahead and lock me up. I would rather spend my life in a holding cell for Stanton County's sexual offenders than go free in a world that would punish a man for the very act of being a man. Alan Tripp

New Study Finds Humans Experience Greatest Feelings Of Joy When Pushing 'Skip Ad' Button
DURHAM, NC — According to a study published Monday by researchers at Duke University's Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, humans experience the most intense feelings of happiness when pressing the "skip ad" button before watching a video on the internet. "After measuring test subjects' endorphin and serotonin levels during a variety of pleasurable activities, we found that the largest spikes in joy were recorded when participants stopped an online advertisement and initiated the video they actually wanted to watch," said the study's lead author, Dr. Paul Alleslev, who noted that feelings of bliss began rising as the timer indicating how soon the button would appear counted down toward zero. "Also, using fMRI scans, we noticed that once the 'skip ad' box became visible, the pleasure centers of the brain lit up with a flurry of activity, as did the motor cortex, prompting subjects to click the button with extraordinary speed as soon as it appeared onscreen." Alleslev added, however, that humans appeared to experience the most acute feelings of rage after they'd watched enough videos that the "skip ad" option was no longer available.

Candidate May Have Lied About Heroic Death In Vietnam
MONTGOMERY, AL — In a major scandal that could cast doubt on his political future, U.S. Senate candidate Chris Wilfred came under fire this week for comments he made alleging he had died heroically while fighting in the Vietnam War. Wilfred made the controversial claim during a speech Monday honoring three American soldiers recently killed in Afghanistan. "I know all too well the depth of their sacrifice, for I myself was killed on a battlefield far away from home," Wilfred, a three-term Democratic state representative, said to a crowd of hundreds. "But we who have laid down our lives — whether in Vietnam or Afghanistan — have done so with the knowledge that our deeds have kept our country safe. Added Wilfred, "Their deaths, like mine, were not in vain. Following the speech, critics pounced on Wilfred's comments, accusing him of overstating his military record for the sake of scoring political points. Rep. Mike Hubbard, who acts as chairman of the Alabama Republican Party, said that a close examination of Wilfred's history shows his claims don't add up. "There's a lot of evidence here that contradicts his statements," Hubbard said. "For one thing, there's no official record of anyone by his name dying as a member of the armed forces during that time. And public documents clearly show that he was married in 1982 and has renewed his driver's license a number of times over the past four decades. "I'm not calling Mr. Wilfred a liar," Hubbard added. "But I think the American people deserve to know the full truth. Footage from various campaign stops in recent weeks reveals a number of inconsistencies in the way Wilfred has portrayed his wartime death. At a rally in Albertville, for example, Wilfred described how he had been fatally wounded during a raid on a Vietcong tunnel complex. Yet at a town hall meeting in Montgomery later that week, he touted his patriotism by pointing out that he had, after all, been gunned down by a sniper while patrolling the Mekong Delta. And in a video from the Calhoun County Fair's annual pie-eating contest, at which Wilfred acted as honorary timekeeper, the Senate candidate is heard recounting his death by rocket-propelled grenade. At one point Wilfred tells participants, "They still haven't found my head. When approached by reporters, Wilfred acknowledged the possibility of minor misstatements but vehemently defended the substance of his comments. "It's natural over the course of a long campaign to misspeak in some small way now and again," Wilfred said. "But I know what I gave for my country. I know where my last drop of blood was spilled. I was there. Continued Wilfred, "How dare you dishonor my memory to my face? Nevertheless, a new conservative advocacy group called Truth 2010 has unveiled an attack ad assailing the candidate's credibility. Called "Where's The Grave?" the 30- second spot slowly pans across a row of veterans' headstones as a voice-over intones, "Come clean, Chris Wilfred. Or tell us which one of these is yours. When told of the ad, a spokesman for the Wilfred campaign accused Truth 2010 of trying to distract voters from the real issues. "Folks in Alabama are worried about their jobs and providing for their families, not this junk," Wilfred campaign spokeswoman Deana Riggs said. "Come November, voters aren't going to care about who did or didn't die in this or that war. "Chris Wilfred is the man for the job," Riggs continued. "God rest his soul. Public reaction to the controversy has thus far been mixed. Bob Melick, a self- described independent voter, told reporters that while he would withhold judgment until all the facts were in, he hoped the allegations against Wilfred proved untrue. "I guess I don't want to believe the worst about him," Melick said. "But whatever happens, I'll always respect him for being the man who killed Hitler."

Yovanovitch Testifies That She Was Removed To Make Way For Corrupt Back Channel But Gets If No One Cares About Anything Anymore
WASHINGTON — Appearing before the House Intelligence Committee at Friday's impeachment hearing, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testified that she was recalled from her post so a corrupt back channel could run U.S. policy in Ukraine but gets it if no one cares about anything anymore. "President Trump and his allies conducted a smear campaign against me knowing I would refuse to participate in advancing illegal activities on their behalf, though I totally understand if you don't give a shit because that's just the way things work now and nothing matters," said Yovanovitch, who stated that while she found Trump's actions "shocking" and "unprecedented," lawmakers were free to cut her off at any time so that they could all go back to wallowing in the sense of meaninglessness that has come to permeate American life. "This has never really happened in the history of the modern presidency, but I can sympathize if you're shrugging it off — I'm shrugging it off, too. Even if we do prove the president is guilty of high crimes, so what? It's not like there are rules anymore. Frankly, I was surprised that I was called to testify at all." At press time, Yovanovitch told the committee that if anyone wanted to join her, she was heading to a bar to drink until she couldn't feel anything anymore.

'You Are Donald Trump, 45th President Of The United States,' Trump Reads From Faded Tattoo On Wrist
WASHINGTON — Waking in the same bleary-eyed state of confusion as he has every day of his Presidency, Donald Trump blinked at his unfamiliar surroundings and slowly shook his head several times before finding and reading the phrase, "You are Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States," from a faded tattoo on his wrist this morning, White House sources confirmed. "You are commander in chief of the armed forces, you are a Republican, and your current wife's name is Melania," said a bleary, shirtless Trump, standing in front of a mirror and reading those words, as well as "Remember: Argue for immigration shutdown" and "Attack biased media," from his completely ink-covered chest. "Rules for press conferences: evade criticisms by mentioning Hillary Clinton; smear protesters; Russia probe is witch hunt. Stephen M. and John K. are friends. All others may be dismissed/thrown under bus as necessary." At press time, a glimmer of recognition could be seen in Trump's eyes as he viewed a VHS tape he found on his dresser labeled "Good morning, Donald: Watch this," which carefully detailed the 2016 election numbers and inauguration crowd size.

Struggling Forever 21 Reminds Teens That Parents Won't Notice $20 Missing From Wallet Every Now And Then
LOS ANGELES — Revamping its business model as it reportedly prepares to file for bankruptcy, retail fashion chain Forever 21 debuted a brand-new, multi-city ad campaign Thursday to remind teenage consumers that parents don't notice if, every once in a while, a $20 bill goes missing from their wallet. "We're refocusing on the 13-to-18-year-old demographic and letting them know that if you just help yourself to a few dollars here and there, no one will be the wiser and you'll soon save up enough for our new line of tops, leggings, and jumpsuits," said Forever 21 marketing supervisor Brandon Sturt, adding that your mom probably doesn't even know how much cash is in her purse and, if you think about it, she's been kind of a bitch lately. "One of our new billboards features a model holding a finger to her lips conveying to teens their secret is safe with us. In the unlikely event they do get caught by their mom or dad, we are urging our young patrons to simply tell their parents that if they're that hard up for cash, they shouldn't have had kids in the first place." Forever 21 executives expressed hope that this latest marketing effort will prove more successful than last year's "We Don't Care If You Shoplift, Take Whatever" campaign.

Nation Ready To Be Lied To About Economy Again
WASHINGTON — After nearly four months of frank, honest, and open dialogue about the failing economy, a weary U.S. populace announced this week that it is once again ready to be lied to about the current state of the financial system. Tired of hearing the grim truth about their economic future, Americans demanded that the bald-faced lies resume immediately, particularly whenever politicians feel the need to divulge another terrifying problem with Wall Street, the housing market, or any one of a hundred other ticking time bombs everyone was better off not knowing about. In addition, citizens are requesting that the phrase, "It will only get worse before it gets better," be permanently replaced with, "Things are going great. Enjoy yourselves. "I thought I wanted a new era of transparency and accountability, but honestly, I just can't handle it," Ohio resident Nathan Pletcher said. "All I ever hear about now is how my retirement has been pushed back 15 years and how I won't be able to afford my daughter's tuition when she grows up. "From now on, just tell me the bullshit I want to hear," Pletcher added. "Tell me my savings are okay, everybody has a job, and we're No. 1 again. Please, just lie to my face. The national call for decreased candor began last month, after the Department of Labor released another soul-crushing report that most Americans agreed "wasn't helping anything" and "didn't need to be so specific, at least. The report estimated that 663,000 private and public sector jobs were lost in the month of March — a revealing statistic many people found shockingly blunt. Responding to the new information, an overwhelming majority of citizens said they believe that, during these extremely uncertain times, our leaders have a responsibility to come together, sit the American people down, and lie through their teeth about everything from misappropriations of taxpayer dollars to the severity of the credit crisis. "I don't need to be constantly reminded that the lack of regulations on Wall Street compounded with failing institutions like AIG basically plunged the world economy into a global recession," said 32-year-old office manager Alexis Harrington. "What I want is for someone to tell me with a straight face that the GDP is through the roof so that I can feel better and instantly forget what all these terms even mean. "For the first time in my life I know who the secretary of the treasury is," Harrington continued. "And I don't like it. Reluctantly informed citizens like Harrington have also asked that CEOs of the nation's five largest banks release a joint statement saying that the October bailout worked perfectly, normal lending has resumed, and that we're nowhere close to having the entire monetary system collapse upon itself like a house of cards. According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, 98 percent of Americans no longer appreciate President Barack Obama's attempts to break down the economic crisis into simple terms they can understand. Instead, many say the president should have the decency to insult their intelligence by using complex jargon to confuse and deceive them, perhaps even implying that the subprime mortgage fallout was just a big misunderstanding that resulted from a clerical error. "I know when he's telling the truth, and it bothers me," recently laid-off schoolteacher Mary Hanover said of Obama. "He gets this serious expression on his face and says things like, 'This is the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.' Who needs to hear that? For Christ's sake, smile a bit and say we just found a diamond mine under Montana that's going to pay for everything. I'll believe you. "Please, treat me like a child. Treat me like a five-year-old," Sacramento resident David Cooke, 64, wrote in a letter to Congress. "I lost everything when the Dow tanked, and I'm too old to start working again, so why punish me further by explaining in detail the clever ways these investment firms ripped me off and how they're all going to get away with it? Thus far, many policymakers in Washington have responded favorably to their constituents' requests, saying they respect and understand the public's need for dishonesty. "I think we can accommodate the American people on this," Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) told reporters. "Why, just today we made excellent progress with GM, whose CEO Fritz Henderson told us that every penny of federal and taxpayer funds would go directly to the construction of three new auto plants in Detroit that will create over 90,000 new jobs and spark the economic rebound we've been waiting for. Continued Reid, "Things are looking very, very bright.

'Oh God, What Happened Last Night?' Says Groggy Mike Pence After Waking Up In Same Bed As Wife
WASHINGTON — Experiencing a rising sense of dread as he opened his eyes Friday morning and noticed the woman asleep beside him, a groggy and confused Vice President Mike Pence reportedly muttered, "Oh God, what happened last night?" upon waking up in the same bed as his wife. "This is Karen's bed — what have I done?" said a visibly panicked Pence, his fear increasing as he discovered that he was completely naked except for his underwear and pajama pants, while second lady Karen Pence wore no socks or nightcap, her feet and head completely nude. "We didn't, did we? I mean, I don't think we did, but I'm not a hundred percent sure. Oh, no, no, no. C'mon, Mike, what's gotten into you? How could you be so reckless? What on earth were you thinking having that second glass of milk last night? You idiot! You better just hope you didn't do anything you'll regret." At press time, sources reported the vice president was praying that no one would see him as he quietly snuck out of his wife's bedroom and stumbled back to his own quarters, where he immediately showered in a futile attempt to wash away his shame.

Half-Fabricated Résumé Still Unimpressive

'No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens
PARKLAND, FL — In the hours following a violent rampage in Florida in which a lone attacker killed 17 individuals and seriously injured over a dozen others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Wednesday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. "This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop them," said Indiana resident Harold Turner, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world's deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations. "It's a shame, but what can we do? There really wasn't anything that was going to keep this individual from snapping and killing a lot of people if that's what they really wanted." At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years were referring to themselves and their situation as "helpless."

Trump Boys Construct Fake Melania For Lonely Father To Spend Time With
WASHINGTON — Adding the finishing touches of two earrings made of twisted paper clips and a mop head hastily colored brown with magic marker, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump spent several hours constructing a life-sized fake Melania Trump for their lonely father to spend time with, White House sources confirmed Friday. "There, that's perfect — Dad's gonna be so happy to have this new Mommy to be married to until our old Mommy comes back," said Eric Trump, drawing his best approximation of Melania Trump's facial features on a paper plate while his brother stapled a floor-length Dior evening gown to a stack of throw pillows roughly the height of the absent first lady. "We spent a whole bunch of time on it, and it definitely shows. I bet Dad won't even be able to tell the difference." At press time, the Trump boys were duct-taping a paperback copy of Animorphs #28 to the doll's inflated rubber glove hands in preparation for story time.

2018 The Year It All Going To Fall Into Place, Delusional Sources Report
WASHINGTON — Fooling themselves into believing things were going to be turning around, delusional sources reported Friday that 2018 will be the year it's all going to fall into place. "No ifs, ands, or buts about it, everything is finally going to come together in 2018," said Liam Thomas of Margate, FL, echoing the sentiments of others nationwide who had also completely lost touch with reality and had absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support their optimistic claims. "I just know that things are going to start happening for me. I laid the groundwork in 2017, but 2018 is when my career's gonna take off, I'll start eating right, and I might even meet that special someone. Yeah, it's going to be great." At press time, sources had already reportedly decided not to make the same mistakes in 2019.

Rain-Soaked Robert Mueller Lets Manafort Surf One Final Monster Wave Before Bringing Him In
VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA — Standing on the beach and stoically observing the tiny diagonal line that Trump's desperately paddling campaign manager made across the sheer magnificence of the thrashing ocean, rain-soaked Special Counsel Robert Mueller silently endured a torrential downpour Tuesday while allowing Paul Manafort to surf one final monster wave before taking him into custody. "After careful consideration, I've determined there's no way Paul can handle a cage," said Mueller, ignoring the lashing storm and the open handcuff dangling from his left wrist as he watched the former Trump campaign chairman cut back across the face of an 80-foot, once-in-a-lifetime wave. "Manafort has a death wish. He just wants to ride to glory. Don't bother looking for him. He's not coming back." Sources confirmed that the drenched special counsel watched for a long moment after Manafort's board disappeared below the churning water and then left the beach by himself, pausing only to toss his badge into the foaming shallows.

University Admits It Pretty Weird They Let Bunch Of 20-Year-Olds Live In Big Mansion And Torture Each Other
TUSCALOOSA, AL — Suddenly realizing that the tradition was actually sort of strange when one stopped to really think about it, University of Alabama administrators admitted to reporters Thursday that it was pretty weird that they let a bunch of 20-year-olds live in a big mansion and torture each other. "I guess allowing a bunch of young adults who basically just graduated high school to use a historic 30-room manor to conduct rituals designed to humiliate and endanger one another is kind of bizarre," said University of Alabama president Stuart R. Bell, noting that the dozens of enormous, stately homes around campus filled with young people inserting objects into each other's rectums and forcing the most vulnerable among them to binge drink until they get alcohol poisoning or, in some cases, even die, did seem slightly off. "I suppose it's a bit peculiar to provide students whom we are supposedly preparing to function in the real world with a luxurious manor in which they piss all over one another. I mean, it's odd enough that a group of impressionable, still-immature students are mentally and physically abusing one another for fun, but we also give them a big, gorgeous house to do it in." At press time, the university had reportedly forgotten all about the issue when they received a large donation check from one of their wealthy fraternity alumni.

Jesus Announces Plans To Return Once The Dow Clears 27,000
THE HEAVENS — Urging Christians nationwide to "Buy! Buy!

"Listen, my children, and I will tell you — when the NYSE closing bell rings out and the Dow Jones Industrial Average soars above 27,000 points, I will return to strike down the wicked and reign over the righteous forevermore," said Our Lord and Savior, adding that only increased consumer confidence and low interest rates could hasten His glorious Second Coming. "Rejoice, stockholders, for the kingdom of God is at hand, assuming this upward trend continues. Repent and believe in the gospel of the bull market." At press time, the Prince of Peace and Everlasting Counselor was scrambling to sell after the Dow had plunged 500 points.

Mom Makes Sure Everyone Has Masturbated Before Long Car Ride
LANARK, IL — Adamant that there would be no unplanned pit stops until her family had reached its destination, local mom Mary Curran reportedly made sure that each of her teenage sons had masturbated to completion Thursday before a long car ride to their grandparents' house. "It's going to be three hours — maybe more with traffic — so even if you don't have to jerk off right this second, you should at least try," said Curran, hoping to avoid a repeat of their last trip when they barely managed to pull off I-39 in time for her youngest to blow his load into a ditch. "I know you say you just cranked one out, but you say that every time. Please just go and pleasure yourself now so we don't find ourselves desperately looking for an exit with a Denny's that will let you jack it without buying anything first." Curran went on to fault her husband for letting the kids watch so much porn with breakfast.

Red Cross Issues Reminder They Can't Accept Donations From People With Loose Blood Cupped In Hands
WASHINGTON — Emphasizing that the practice was neither sterile nor sanitary, American Red Cross officials issued a reminder Friday that they cannot accept donations from people who approach them with loose blood cupped in their hands. "While we certainly appreciate the act of generosity, we must discourage any potential donors from approaching one of our workers with a small puddle of plasma cradled in your hands," said American Red Cross President Gail McGovern, describing the thousands of gallons of donations lost every year when individuals either try to hand their loose blood to a volunteer or simply mutter "here's some blood" before dumping it on the floor of a Red Cross facility. "Also, we must stress that individuals can't enter a clinic covering an openly bleeding wound and tell us to just take as much as we want. Jesus Christ, just come to us and let a trained professional do their work." McGovern added that she should not need to clarify this, but that the blood always needs to come from a human, rather than a goat or cow.

Lions, Zebras, Giraffes Run Off Cliff Shrieking En Masse As Shadow Of Melania Trump's Jet Passes Over Savanna
DABOYA, GHANA — Birds fell from the sky, meerkats devoured their young, and shrieking packs of lions, zebras, and baboons reportedly ran off cliffs in staggering numbers as the shadow of Melania Trump's jet passed over the African savanna Tuesday. Sources confirmed that as the plane carrying the first lady moved across the sky high above the grasslands, herds of wildebeests were spotted stampeding directly into each other, their hoofbeats drowned out by the deafening sound of snapping bones, while a nearby pair of giraffes was seen ripping apart a screeching hyena. According to reports, the severed hyena then attempted to drown itself by dragging the top half of its body to a watering hole, which was thick with the blood of a dozen hippopotamuses that appeared to be eagerly devouring their own entrails. After the aircraft disappeared over the horizon, the hysteria reportedly ended and the savanna quickly returned to normal, with vultures descending upon the thousands of carcasses that lay rotting in the first lady's wake.

Jeff Bezos Tables Latest Breakthrough Cost-Cutting Idea After Realizing It's Just Slaves
SEATTLE — Deciding at the last minute to hold off due to ethical concerns, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos reportedly set aside his latest cost-cutting initiative Wednesday after realizing it was actually human slavery. "On the surface, it seemed plausible — owning our employees' bodies, implementing a mandatory 18-hour workday, restricting their movements, and not compensating them with anything besides minimal food and shelter — but then it started to sound really familiar in a bad way," said Bezos, who acknowledged his fears were confirmed when Amazon's general counsel kept reporting back that such labor arrangements had been illegal throughout the United States since 1865. "It's too bad; the increased efficiency and cost savings would have been tremendous. And now I have to go explain to our shareholders why I spent $1.8 million outfitting all of our managers with bullwhips, shackles, and branding irons." Bezos went on to describe the setback as temporary, saying it wouldn't matter in five to 10 years when his entire workforce was robots.

City Opens New Art Jail
SAN FRANCISCO — City officials announced the opening of a new maximum-security art jail Tuesday, unveiling a modern detention facility designed to imprison a large population of high-profile paintings and sculptures. The brightly lit four-story structure, located in the heart of San Francisco's downtown, is sectioned off into 30 cell blocks, each confining nearly 1,000 pieces of art in small, sparse rooms where guards can keep a close eye on them at all times. "Our goal was to create an institution capable of housing some of the world's most sophisticated and renown artworks," said art jail warden and distinguished Rembrandt scholar Dominique Paulson. "By keeping these masterpieces within our walls — whether temporarily or on a permanent basis — we hope to do a great service to our city and to society as a whole. According to Paulson, the new art jail will maintain strict visiting hours between 9:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday, with lights out occurring promptly afterward. The facility will reportedly be closed to the public on Mondays. Sources confirmed the art jail's inmates include some of the most hardened terra-cotta statues in the world, as well as numerous depraved creations from the Rococo period, many of them not having seen the light of day in years. Paulson told reporters that just before Tuesday's opening, a collection of Fauvist canvasses and four large pre-Columbian petroglyphs had been transferred to her facility. "They keep sending us more every day," Paulson said. "It's good to rotate new pieces in now and then, but if they send us any more shards of Etruscan pottery, we're going to have a serious overcrowding problem in our Hall of the Ancients exhibit. "It's hard to find room for new acquisitions in there, because most of that wing is occupied by high-value artifacts that will likely be here forever," Paulson added. In addition to a video surveillance system that monitors all 48,000 square feet of the new building, art jail officials said they have installed motion-activated alarms that run through every floor and wall in order to minimize any chance of the imprisoned art getting loose. "I run a pretty tight ship around here, and I think that makes all the difference," said Ernie Wilhelm, head of the art jail's 400-person security team. "For every piece of art that's in here, there are four or five people who'd love to get it out. As a result, everything is secured and totally locked down in its place, with the exception of a couple interactive installations and the Calder mobile hanging in the atrium. The artworks are reportedly confined at different security levels, with particularly prominent or notorious paintings being held in rooms all by themselves, where they hang on otherwise bare walls and are kept under close scrutiny by guards. Paulson has defended this practice of solitary confinement to reporters, arguing that it is used rarely and claiming that many works in the art jail, including most of the contemporary sculptures, are allowed to spend time in the open-air courtyard. "If you want to maintain order, you have to put each piece in its proper place," said Paulson, explaining that inmates were strictly divided by genre, artist, and form. "The Pointillist works are with the other Pointillist works. The Monets are with the Monets. The ancient Hellenistic reliefs are a little older so they have their own area. Most visitors to the art jail on Tuesday said they were grateful for the opportunity to see the prisoners, though some acknowledged the experience was emotionally complicated for them. "My dad's been in places like this ever since I can remember," said Jim Rothko, standing outside the Abstract Expressionist cell block. "I always try to come by and see him from time to time, but it's hard. Deep down, though, I have to admit this is where he belongs.

Couple Fucking At Next Table Obviously On Third Date
SARATOGA SPRINGS, NY — Unable to help themselves from eavesdropping on the interaction going on in the romantic corner behind them, diners at the Boca Bistro told reporters Monday that the couple fucking at the next table was obviously on their third date. "From the number of excuse-me's and little exclamations of surprise, you can tell they clearly don't know each other all that well yet, but it's pretty obvious this isn't their first date," said restaurant patron Alan Geiger, adding that it seemed the fornicating pair was becoming comfortable enough to actually enjoy themselves without worrying so much about impressing the other. "They're having a good time despite being at least a little nervous. Of course, they're stammering and fumbling around a bit, sure, and you can tell they're both worried about their hair, but there's no denying that the two of them have chemistry." Sources close to the couple confirmed they had a really nice time and are making plans to do it again sometime.

Best TV Shows Of The Decade
A revealing documentary series exploring the occult, esoteric British subculture of preparing food with dry heat, otherwise known as baking. Originally titled Is This Wife Good Or Bad?, this incredible work of television eventually succumbed to focus groups, which demanded a less ambiguous narrative. That part where the screen looks like it's cracking made us jump in our seats every time. Even in the machismo-fueled world of 1960s advertising, the AMC drama managed to give us an incredible cast of strong female characters, including Miss Chiquita Banana, the Morton Salt Girl, and Aunt Jemima. The legacy of this acclaimed, massively influential comedy came to be overshadowed by the predatory real-life behavior of deputy audio engineer Ben Mikelonis. The HBO miniseries earned plaudits for the bold choice to tell its story from the perspective of a mute, 800-ton uranium dioxide reactor. This popular retro horror series still made the list despite a dip in quality in its first, second, and third seasons. Whatever this show was about, it absolutely dominated the decade's city bus advertising.

Best Sports Stadiums
As Detroit prepares to demolish and say goodbye to the storied Joe Louis Arena, Onion Sports examines some of the greatest stadiums of all time. Has been selected by The Saginaw News as the best 100,000-plus-seat venue in Washtenaw County for 13 consecutive years. Grunts travel up to 150 percent faster on clay courts than hard courts, making the home of the French Open a favorite among ATP pros. The original home of the Yankees was torn down in 2010, but fans can still visit the grounds to meet historical actors who reveal what it was like throughout important eras. The home of the New Orleans Saints was also briefly home to New Orleans. On September 29, 2014, the stadium finally broke the record for loudest crowd when season ticket holder Allen Haskins sneezed while clapping. The legendary Manhattan arena has hosted the NBA and NHL Finals, the Final Four, and golf's U.S. Open. Hairpin turns and gravity-defying jumps make this the true test of the Star Cup. One of the largest HD video displays in the world hangs from the roof of the Arlington, Texas stadium, giving fans a clear view of the Cowboys playing​ their home games at a separate nearby location. The second-oldest ballpark in baseball still features a charming, hand-operated home plate umpire. The stadium is famous for the "Green Monster" in left field, though the more discriminating fan appreciates the complexity and intricacies of the ballpark's right field fence.

Bodybuilder Strong, But Now What?
AMES, IA — Staring wistfully in the mirror as he flexed his tanned, oversized muscles, local bodybuilder Jai Dragovich told reporters Monday that ever since he became sufficiently strong, he couldn't help but wonder: now what? "I've been so busy finding out how much weight I could lift that I never paused to ask if this is what I should be doing with my life," said Dragovich, who added that even though he'd recently hit his target weight of 260 pounds and was down to 2 percent body fat, he wasn't sure what to do with it all now, or what to use it for. "Do I just keep lifting heavier and heavier things? Do I use my strength to murder someone? God, I look so scary now. I guess I'm just locked into this never-ending cycle of weightlifting until I eventually die." At press time, Dragovich had reportedly wiped off his body oil and left his home, telling sources that there must be more to life than just building muscle, and goddammit, he was going to find it.

WASHINGTON — Wearing a leotard and chain-smoking as he pounded out the measures with his cane, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly screamed, "It's step, twist, step, dammit!" at a group of Marines on Wednesday as they learned the choreography for President Trump's upcoming military parade. "Jesus Christ, how many times do I have to tell you it's step, twist, step, shuffle, lean-and-point, and point-and-roll?" a visibly furious Kelly said as he threw a chair across the military hangar, removed his scarf, and commanded the battalion to "just watch [him]" as he demonstrated the dance in front of a full-length mirror. "Again, do it again! We'll stay here all night if we have to. Seriously, you call yourselves dancers? It's like I'm working with a bunch of goddamn amateurs." After exploding at a private first class whom he sent home for wearing the wrong boots, Kelly told everyone they were taking a "quick five," and that when they returned, they had better do it right or he would be making some cuts.

Gap Between Rich And Poor Named 8th Wonder Of The World
PARIS — At a press conference Tuesday, the World Heritage Committee officially recognized the Gap Between Rich and Poor as the "Eighth Wonder of the World," describing the global wealth divide as the "most colossal and enduring of mankind's creations. "Of all the epic structures the human race has devised, none is more staggering or imposing than the Gap Between Rich and Poor," committee chairman Henri Jean-Baptiste said. "It is a tremendous, millennia-old expanse that fills us with both wonder and humility. "And thanks to careful maintenance through the ages, this massive relic survives intact, instilling in each new generation a sense of awe," Jean- Baptiste added. The vast chasm of wealth, which stretches across most of the inhabited world, attracts millions of stunned observers each year, many of whom have found its immensity too overwhelming even to contemplate. By far the largest man-made structure on Earth, it is readily visible from locations as far-flung as Eastern Europe, China, Africa, and Brazil, as well as all 50 U.S. states. "The original Seven Wonders of the World pale in comparison to this," said World Heritage Committee member Edwin MacAlister, standing in front of a striking photograph of the Gap Between Rich and Poor taken from above Mexico City. "It is an astounding feat of human engineering that eclipses the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Giza, and perhaps even the Great Racial Divide." According to anthropologists, untold millions of slaves and serfs toiled their whole lives to complete the gap. Records indicate the work likely began around 10,000 years ago, when the world's first landed elites convinced their subjects that construction of such a monument was the will of a divine authority, a belief still widely held today. Though historians have repeatedly disproved such claims, theories still persist among many that the Gap Between Rich and Poor was built by the Jews. "When I stare out across its astounding breadth, I'm often moved to tears," said Johannesburg resident Grace Ngubane, 31, whose home is situated on one of the widest sections of the gap. "The scale is staggering — it makes you feel really, really small. "Insignificant, even," she continued. While numerous individuals have tried to cross the Gap Between Rich and Poor, evidence suggests that only a small fraction have ever succeeded and many have died in the attempt. Its official recognition as the Eighth Wonder of the World marks the culmination of a dramatic turnaround from just 50 years ago, when popular movements called for the gap's closure. However, due to a small group of dedicated politicians and industry leaders, vigorous preservation efforts were begun around 1980 to restore — and greatly expand — the age-old structure. "It's breathtaking," said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, a longtime champion and benefactor of the rift's conservation. "After all we've been through in recent years, there's no greater privilege than watching it grow bigger and bigger each day. There may be a few naysayers who worry that if it gets any wider, the whole thing will collapse upon itself and take millions of people down with it, but I for one am willing to take that chance. Added Blankfein, "Besides, something tells me I'd probably make it out okay.

Subway Manager Disgusted By Sight Of Cold Cut Combo Devouring Large Rat
UNION CITY, NJ — Saying the disturbing incident made him sick to his stomach, Subway shift manager Dean Haney told reporters Wednesday he was completely disgusted after seeing a Cold Cut Combo devour a large rat in the alley behind the restaurant. "I went to take out the trash, and I saw this nasty-looking thing just feasting on a full-grown rat," said Haney, estimating the size of the sandwich as "at least six inches," and describing it as mangy, vicious, and dripping with Italian dressing. "It completely tore the rat apart before wolfing the whole mess down — I honestly almost puked. The worst part is, if you see one of these things out there, you know there are probably hundreds more around somewhere." Haney noted that after it finished consuming the rat, the revolting and likely disease-ridden Cold Cut Combo scuttled under a dumpster and into a crevice in the wall, presumably returning to its fetid nest.

Tim Duncan Sternly Reminds Spurs About Maximum Occupancy Limit Of Locker Room
SAN ANTONIO — Interrupting teammates, coaches, and trainers during their pregame preparations Tuesday evening, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan reportedly delivered a stern reminder that the team must adhere to the maximum occupancy limit of their locker room. "The sign on the wall is very clear, guys — the maximum occupancy of this room cannot exceed 50 people, and we are well over that limit right now," Duncan was overheard saying, adding that if the fire marshal were to walk in and see the group of 54 people in the locker room, the Spurs would be facing a $500 fine for creating a building hazard. "San Antonio Building Code 6-155.2 explicitly states that every person in a recreation facility of this size requires at least six square feet of space, and we have clearly exceeded that. Either four of us need to wait outside from now on, or the locker room needs to be expanded by roughly 24 square feet in order to increase the occupancy limit permitted by law." At press time, Duncan was frantically attempting to clear all 18,000 fans out of the AT&T Center after realizing that one of the seating sections in the upper deck did not contain the legally required number of fire exits.

Man Entirely Different Misogynist Online Than In Real Life
CHATTANOOGA, TN — Explaining how his subtle belittlement and disrespect for women in face-to-face interactions had little in common with the bold, outspoken manner in which he degrades women when he's on social media or website message boards, sources reported Tuesday that local man Colin McManus is a totally different misogynist online than in real life. McManus, who is said to regularly post brazenly offensive tirades in YouTube comment sections dictating how he thinks women should behave and stating which female public figures he believes deserve to be sexually assaulted, reportedly keeps such opinions entirely to himself in person, instead favoring small jabs at female acquaintances' decision-making abilities and regularly discrediting women's emotions by casually claiming their reactions are overly sensitive or melodramatic. Sources confirmed that whether McManus bitterly inveighs against women's sexual activity in long, slur-ridden outbursts or issues softly worded slights or praise that tie a woman's appearance to her worth depended wholly on whether he's sitting alone in front of a computer or engaged in an actual conversation in his workplace or social setting. At press time, McManus was said to be looking down at his phone, attempting to quietly undercut a female coworker's opinions by denying eye contact and ignoring what she was currently saying, while at the same moment discovering he had been blocked on Twitter by another woman he regularly threatened.

Postal Service Celebrates Another Awesome Day Of Delivering Mail
'We Did It Again, You Guys,' Jubilant Postmaster Declares WASHINGTON — Emphatic cheers of "We did it again!" and "USPS is the best!" rang out from the nation's post offices Tuesday as the United States Postal Service celebrated yet another amazing day of successfully delivering the country's mail. At 5:01 p.m., Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe popped a champagne cork as confetti and balloons fell from the ceiling of USPS's Washington headquarters and joyous employees cartwheeled in unison through the hallways, sources reported. Amidst the revelry, postal workers congratulated and hugged one another for once again delivering all 584 million pieces of the day's mail to their proper destinations. "You can put another great day of delivering mail in the books, fellas!" said the jubilant postmaster general, who was greeted with thunderous applause and random cheers of "No mail is junk mail!" by his employees. "We sorted, we accumulated, we delivered. And you know what? We did it together. I love you guys!" "Everyone in America got their magazines!" added Donahoe, who was then hoisted onto the shoulders of several D.C. postmen and carried into the courtyard where a 20-piece orchestra was playing "Signed, Sealed, Delivered." As the festivities continued on the East Coast with delivery trucks honking their horns and the entire USPS airplane fleet tipping their wings mid-flight, Donahoe called up the Big Board — a giant television screen with a live feed to every post office in America — to see how the celebrations were progressing across the country. "Let's check in on Broomfield!" Donahoe shouted as the screen cut to a small post office in Colorado, whose champagne-drenched mailmen were once again unfurling their giant "You Asked, We Delivered!" banner. "You're the best, Broomfield. And now let's kick it to Omaha! Nice! Good stuff from the Cornhusker State. And now Kansas City! And Dallas! And Salt Lake City! Ladies and gentlemen, the mail carriers of Cincinnati, Ohio!" "Looking good, Cincinnati," Donahoe added. "Love the choreography!" Other highlights from the revelry included a quarter-mile-long postal worker conga line in New Jersey, mailmen in Tampa, FL tossing their coworkers into the air with a giant blanket, and federal workers from the five post offices in Santa Fe, NM gathering in Fort Marcy Park for a fireworks display, carnival games, and performances of numerous mail-related songs and skits. Similar nationwide celebrations reportedly occurred the previous night, last Saturday, Friday, and every day that mail has been delivered since Benjamin Franklin established the government agency in 1775. "Twenty million letters, 8 million birthday cards, 100 million Capital One Bank credit card offers, and 5 million different types of forms were delivered from one side of the country to the other, a majority of them for just 44 cents," former Utah Jazz power forward and basketball legend Karl Malone said in a message to the nation's mailmen taped earlier in the day. "It's a modern miracle, and you're responsible for it. So raise a glass and take a drink, because you deserve it." Nobody was injured during any of the nationwide festivities — many of which devolved into late-night dance parties — and all postal workers interviewed said they had the time of their lives. "We rocked it today, guys!" Harrisburg, PA mailman Tom Burnsworth said. "And we're gonna rock it again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and the day after that, and then on Sunday we're not gonna do it. But on Monday we're gonna do it again!" "Who are we?" Burnsworth shouted at his colleagues, who immediately responded, "Mailmen!" "What do we do? Deliver mail! When are weather conditions too inclement? Never! USPS, USPS, USPS!" As Burnsworth received a roaring ovation from his coworkers, Pennsylvania resident Debbie Lustick, 42, told reporters that she had yet to receive a package she has been expecting since last Thursday.

30 Years Of Man's Life Disappear In Mysterious 'Kansas Rectangle'
CHICAGO — The so-called "Kansas rectangle," a desolate and featureless region covering 82,277 square miles in America's mysterious Great Plains, has been a source of speculation among paranormal investigators for decades. Though the questions surrounding its existence have never been answered, one thing is certain: The life of former Chicagoan Kevin Corcoran suddenly vanished into the eerie region 30 years ago this week, never to return. According to his friends and family, Corcoran, a bright and energetic young man of 18, was last seen driving into the Rectangle in a Plymouth Duster on the afternoon of May 8, 1978. Surveillance footage shows him stopping at a gas station near the border to buy fuel and snacks at 4:15 p.m. Although his trip was only supposed to last the summer, he was never seen or heard from again. The last known communication from Corcoran was sent from somewhere within the Rectangle, and made reference to plans to marry a large blond woman and enroll in a local technical college. Records indicate the message was received from 37 degrees 42 minutes north latitude and 97 degrees 20 minutes west longitude — but when searchers attempted to investigate that location, they found nothing but a tiny town with zero signs of life. "Who knows if my son will ever return to civilization," said Corcoran's father, Dennis, now 76. "Some have reported seeing a pale and dead-eyed specter of him, trudging to and from a small office-supply firm every day, but they could just be legends. We don't know. Acquaintances of Corcoran say they warned him that once he entered the Rectangle, he would never make it back out, but he did not listen, and was drawn there to investigate tales of cheap tuition. It wasn't until Corcoran failed to show up in the summer of 1978 for an annual camping trip, however, that the reality of his disappearance began to sink in. "I knew then he wasn't coming back," friend Craig Wilkins said. "He got sucked into this alternative reality, and he can't get out. I'll never see my friend again. As haunting as his story may be, Kevin Corcoran is only one of hundreds of people who, for unknown reasons, have had years or even decades of their lives utterly fade away in the mystifying region. Still, most cases lack any hard evidence: The few known photos from inside the Rectangle show only a flat, blank emptiness, stretching unremarkably to the horizon. What happens in the lives of those who venture within remains a mystery. Matthew Hume, a researcher at the University of Chicago who studies the Rectangle, said the bizarre phenomena associated with the region might never be fully understood. "As best we can tell, those who go beyond the area's borders for too long are knocked off course by the low external pressure to succeed," Hume said. "But after that, it's as if they fall off the face of the earth. There are cases of an entire Greyhound bus full of people entering the Rectangle and vanishing into obscurity. Experts estimate that several million tons of consumer goods disappear into the region per year. Yet, almost nothing, save for the odd Sunday morning church broadcast, is ever detected coming back out. Still, some travelers have returned to tell their tales. The most frequent occurrence reported by those who have survived the Kansas Rectangle is extreme disorientation and an unsettling perception of time distortion. Boulder, CO resident Ned Frome entered the Rectangle in 2005 while en route to visiting family in St. Louis. "I had been driving for hours, but it was as though I hadn't moved at all," Frome said. "I had no idea which direction I was going in. No matter where I looked, everything was exactly the same and before long, normal navigation was almost impossible. "I'll never go in there again," Frome added with a shudder. "I felt like I was going insane. Kyle Manheim, a photocopier salesman from Minneapolis who was once inside the Kansas Rectangle for two weeks on business, said he could not clearly remember any events from the time period. "There isn't a single thing I can recall that would be worth mentioning," Manheim said. "I know I was there, but that's about it. It's like those 14 days never happened. While many strongly believe in the eerie, soul-destroying powers of the Kansas Rectangle, the dearth of concrete evidence has drawn its share of skeptics. "If you look at the statistics, there's nothing going on in that area that doesn't happen every day in the rest of the country," said Stephen Finney, a long-haul trucker who is familiar with the region. "What happened to Kevin Corcoran could have happened in Iowa, Indiana, or even Michigan. "It's just a myth," Finney added. "This whole 'Kansas' place people talk about simply does not exist.

White House To Hold Second Auditions This Week For Nationwide Production Of 'Guys And Dolls'
'We're Still Looking For A Really Good Nathan Detroit,' Obama Says WASHINGTON — Saying they are very close to casting all the principal parts for the nationwide stage production of Guys And Dolls, White House officials announced Monday that a second round of auditions will be held this Thursday, and that the show's director, President Barack Obama, is still looking for the perfect person to fill the lead role of Nathan Detroit. An early cast list posted on the front door of the Capitol Building Sunday revealed that while Obama left the space next to Detroit's name blank, the part of Sister Sarah Brown has gone to 40-year-old claims adjuster Erin Daniels of Birmingham, AL, and that Benny Southstreet will be played by Canton, OH retiree Paul Burnsworth. The role of Nicely Nicely Johnson will be portrayed by Chief Justice John Roberts, who reportedly turned out to be "quite the little tap dancer" and wowed Obama with his rendition of "Sit Down, You're Rockin' The Boat." "I would like to thank the 110 million Americans who came out for the first round of auditions, and urge them to remember that, if they were not called back, there's still plenty of room in the chorus for anyone who wants to get involved, and I'm casting extra gamblers and Hot Box Dolls, too" said the president, who is staging the two-act musical with assistant director Gen. David Petraeus, stage manager Austan Goolsbee, and pit conductor and attorney general Eric Holder. "Also, the role of Nathan Detroit is still wide open. We need a really strong Nathan. He pretty much carries the show. "For those of you who are interested, please bring 16 bars of music, preferably from Nathan's first big number, 'The Oldest Established,'" added Obama, saying he wants to see how well the actors sell the songs. "[Show choreographer] Hillary Clinton will be doing her own callback for 'The Crapshooters' Dance,' so if you are on her list, wear something comfortable and be prepared to move. Okay?" Though Obama reportedly told his creative team that he knew he had his Miss Adelaide the moment Iowa resident Amy Williams opened her mouth to sing "A Bushel And A Peck," and that 45-year-old real estate agent Dale Evans was "born to play Sky [Masterson]," casting Nathan has been much more challenging. Obama, who has heard more than 8 million Americans sing for the part, stressed to reporters that his Nathan should be feckless as well as charming, within driving distance of Washington, able to hit a high F, and available to rehearse five nights a week. "I'm not going to settle for to my lead role," Obama was overheard saying after being urged to cast Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) in the part. "Max [Harrison] didn't have any chemistry with Adelaide, and Nathan [Lane] was okay, but nothing special. "Look, I'm confident that 'Adelaide's Lament' and 'Take Back Your Mink' will be showstoppers, but the second-act duet won't carry the same emotional or comedic heft without a standout Nathan." Obama added. "The audience needs to connect with him immediately. The production — which runs May 26 to 29, with a preview performance for the Hagerstown, MD Rotary Club — marks the revival of a tradition started in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who not only directed Anything Goes, but starred as America's No. 13 most-wanted gangster, Moonface Martin. Past highlights include teacher Linda Miller's portrayal of Julie Jordan in the 1945 production of Carousel, and Defense Secretary Robert McNamara leaving audiences in stitches as J. Pierrepont Finch in Lyndon Johnson's How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying. The tradition stopped abruptly in 1991 when President George H.W. Bush directed a shockingly graphic revival of the musical Hair. If Obama is to breathe new life into the institution — and private comments about his desire to put up A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum next year indicate that he does — sources said the president needs to find his leading man by Thursday. "We'll probably have auditioners read the scene where Nathan tries to convince the owner of the Biltmore Garage to let him have his craps game there," props master and set builder Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf told reporters. "The president says that scene really encapsulates Nathan, but if he doesn't find what he's looking for, it could be a long night. At press time, Obama was reportedly in the White House figuring how he was going to block the large ensemble number "Havana" when he overheard Vice President Joe Biden singing "Luck Be A Lady" with perfect pitch.

Tim Pawlenty Shaves Off Every Hair On His Body In Really Weird Campaign Gaffe
DES MOINES, IA — In what political insiders are calling one of the weirdest campaign gaffes in history, Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty shaved every single hair off his body this weekend while campaigning in Iowa. The bizarre misstep by the former Minnesota governor, who is currently in the midst of a nine-city speaking tour across the crucial early-primary state, has left media pundits and political strategists baffled, with all of them agreeing that shearing the hair from his head, face, arms, legs, and torso has jeopardized Pawlenty's bid for the presidency. "This was a massive and, frankly, confusing miscalculation by Gov. Pawlenty," Republican campaign strategist Matthew Dowd said. "Every candidate attempts to distinguish himself from the field and gain an edge with voters, and unfortunately for the governor, he seems to have come to the conclusion that shaving every inch of himself clean and leaving his body bald and smooth all over would help him better connect with Americans. I just really don't think he thought this one through. "To be honest, I'm sort of at a loss here," Dowd added. "But this will certainly cost him with undecided voters, that's for sure. Public reaction to Pawlenty's slip-up has thus far been overwhelmingly negative. A Rasmussen poll conducted Sunday found that 89 percent of Americans wanted to know why Tim Pawlenty had shaved the hair off every part of his body, one-third of likely voters had no idea why a person would do that, and 9 in 10 citizens said they had absolutely no interest in seeing a man with no body hair in the White House. In addition, countless citizens have argued that Pawlenty's shaved body has distracted the nation from discussing the real issues facing Americans. "When I saw Mr. Pawlenty last week, I think he talked for a long time about family values and maybe balancing the budget, but all I could focus on was how freaky and kind of gross he looked," said 44-year-old Kevin Rios, who attended Friday's town-hall-style meeting with Pawlenty in Denison, IA. "Have you ever been stared at by a guy with no eyelashes? It's the creepiest thing. While the exact rationale behind Pawlenty's full-body hair removal remains unknown, the two-term governor has made his newly shorn look a focal feature of his campaign, having appeared at a series of voter meet-and-greets over the weekend wearing short-sleeve shirts and shorts that prominently displayed his soft, fleshy, and completely hairless limbs. "We believe he's trying to send some sort of message to the electorate, but honestly we have no idea what that message is," said veteran political analyst Kevin Phillips, who stated that it was "hard to imagine" how a candidate could make such a large and admittedly strange blunder in today's era of tightly run campaign machines and focus groups. "Maybe it's something about the importance of cleanliness or nutrition, or — I have no clue. In the wake of widespread criticism and general puzzlement from voters, Pawlenty has seemingly attempted to compensate by making a number of other image shifts that have only served to make him appear odder, including wearing a full-length beaver pelt jacket to a rally in Cedar Rapids, and plugging his hollowed-out earlobes with four-inch stainless-steel ear gauges. Sources have also confirmed that Pawlenty paused in the middle of several recent policy speeches to apply lotion liberally to his bald forearms, calves, and head. When contacted for comment, Pawlenty staffers attempted to downplay critics' assertions that the governor had effectively torpedoed his campaign, arguing that he was still a viable candidate committed to serving the American people. "This campaign is not about who has hair on their body and who hasn't — it's about real issues affecting the American people," campaign manager Nick Ayers said. "Gov. Pawlenty is a bold and decisive conservative leader, and we're confident voters will be able to look past any recent superficial changes in his appearance and recognize that. Despite the largely negative reaction to his recent behavior, a completely hairless Pawlenty continued to outpoll fellow Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich by a four-to-one margin.

Mom Figures It About Time To Sit Down Adolescent Daughter And Explain How Weight Watchers Points Work
BOTHELL, WA — Saying she wanted the 13-year-old to get the right information straight from her, area mom Karen Winston told reporters Wednesday that it was probably about time to sit down with her adolescent daughter and explain how Weight Watchers points work. "I know it's not the most comfortable thing to talk about with your mom, but she's gotten to that point in her life where she just needs to know exactly how many points a cereal bar counts as," said Winston, adding that she wanted to have a frank conversation with her daughter Emma about the four components of SmartPoints so that she could make her own informed choices once she started doing Weight Watchers. "I don't want her making decisions based on stuff she hears at school or sees online, because I'm worried she'll get the wrong idea about how to reach her target weight or, God forbid, do something stupid like eyeball her portion sizes instead of measuring them. I really just want to make sure Emma has a positive, healthy attitude about Weight Watchers, because she'll have to deal with the consequences of the decisions she makes now for the rest of her life." Winston went on to say that she hoped to avoid the mistake she made with her eldest daughter, Ashley, who never received the Weight Watchers points talk and ended up getting fat at 17.

Hundreds Of Miniature Sean Hannitys Burst From Roger Ailes' Corpse
PALM BEACH, FL — Clawing over each other and gasping for air as they emerged, hundreds of miniature Sean Hannitys reportedly burst from Roger Ailes' corpse Thursday shortly after the former Fox News CEO's death. "At first, one little hand broke through his skin, and then dozens and dozens of Sean Hannitys just erupted out of Roger's chest cavity," said one witness, adding that the cacophony caused by the two-inch-tall, mucus-covered Hannitys screeching right-wing talking points drowned out every other sound in the room. "They were suddenly everywhere, shrieking about the war on Christmas, paid protesters, and coddled, crybaby liberals on college campuses. One of the nasty little things even scampered up the wall and started gnawing on the doorframe. And, my Lord, they just smelled so foul." At press time, the miniature Sean Hannitys were ravenously devouring Ailes' corpse.

Completely Sober Employee Still Embarrassing Self At Company Party
SEATTLE — Despite not consuming a single alcoholic beverage throughout the entire event, local marketing associate Patrick Liepert is somehow managing to make a complete fool of himself at Precision Intermedia's end-of-quarter party Friday, fellow employees confirmed. "Just look at him — he hasn't even touched the open bar, and yet he's still knocked over a plate of buffalo wings and made at least two clumsy passes at interns," Liepert's coworker Katie Rankin said as the completely sober man, failing to pick up on social cues that a nearby conversation was over, launched into a meandering anecdote about his former college roommate. "It's actually kind of impressive. Embarrassing yourself as badly as Patrick normally takes at least a few strong drinks on an empty stomach. But he's gone completely sloppy from a seltzer water." At press time, Liepert, whose last alcoholic beverage was reportedly more than a week ago, was telling his boss in too loud a voice how he would have handled the client presentation earlier that day.

NFL Players Worried Increased Media Scrutiny Could Disrupt Locker Room BDSM Culture
DALLAS — Responding to increased media attention in the wake of allegations of improper, hostile conduct within the Miami Dolphins organization, several NFL players across the league today expressed concerns that the heightened scrutiny could potentially disrupt professional football's vibrant locker room BDSM culture. "There's a very delicate team dynamic that exists in the locker room when we all strap on our restraints and engage in hardcore bondage play, and it needs to stay out of the public eye," a harness-clad DeMarcus Ware told reporters through the unzipped mouth slot of his leather face mask, saying that the presence of reporters and photographers would throw off the natural environment of submission, discipline, nipple torture, and sexually charged abuse that currently thrives in all 32 NFL locker rooms. "After the game ends and we return to the locker room to hook ourselves up to the ceiling, the absolute last thing we need is some nosy journalist hanging around watching us drip hot candle wax on each other's moaning bodies. That's just how this sport has always been, and the media needs to respect that and keep their distance." Ware added that any journalists attempting to access the locker room while the players are participating in their usual sadomasochistic activities would have to be taught a lesson.

Narrow Gaps In Bathroom Stall Doors To Be Widened Monday
WASHINGTON — Introducing a new measure set to be implemented nationwide, officials announced that gaps in restroom stall doors in American workplaces, restaurants, schools, theaters, and all other public places will be made wider by the start of business Monday morning. "We ask citizens to bear with us as we modernize every toilet stall in the country by doubling the width of the gap between each door and its surrounding frame," Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said of the sweeping, mandatory initiative. "The inconvenience should only last a few hours — just long enough to reduce the overall height of the stalls by several inches and retrofit the doors so they are slightly translucent and feature no locking bolt. Then you may all get on with your lives." Sebelius added that her department unfortunately does not have room in its budget to pay for the lubrication of the country's glory holes, but said an effort would be made to sand down any sharp edges that are found.

Capitol Building Haunted By Spirit Of Killed Piece Of Legislation
WASHINGTON — Beltway sources confirmed rumors this week that the U.S. Capitol is haunted by the ghost of H.R. 4591, a transportation appropriations bill brutally killed by Congress 16 years ago on the floor of the House. Records show that the promising young piece of legislation, known as the Highway and Port Improvement Act of 1996, was gruesomely tabled in front of hundreds of representatives who reportedly did nothing to keep it from dying. In the years since the killing, lawmakers have reported a range of eerie phenomena they attribute to the bill's vengeful, tortured soul, from apparitions of the dead act appearing in stacks of pending bills, to inexplicable, bone-chilling breezes emanating from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chambers. Capitol Hill sources have speculated the restless spirit of the bill will never cease its anguished search for discretionary funding until it receives enough votes to move onto the next life in the Senate. "Most people in these parts go pale when you mention the name H.R. 4591 and refuse to talk about it," said Reginald Boyd, a longtime House aide who witnessed the bill's agonizing, drawn-out death over a long series of procedural votes and markups. "I'll never be able to erase that horrific legislative session from my mind. Congress completely ignored the bill's desperate calls to modernize highway interchanges and replace aging bridge pilings. They callously butchered its preamble and tore it subsection-from-subsection until you could barely tell it was a transportation bill at all. "When they finally left it for dead, riders were sticking out of it everywhere and it just lay there bloated and lifeless, festering on the table for weeks," continued Boyd, pausing a moment to collect himself. "No innocent, well-meaning legislation ever deserves such a cruel fate. Over the years, Capitol employees have come to blame the dead legislation for countless mysterious occurrences, from misplaced documents, to C-SPAN technical glitches, to the repeated failure of high-speed rail legislation, to unexplained gaveling sounds coming from the House chamber in the cold, dark night. Additionally, in 2009, several members of the House Republican caucus claimed to have witnessed an apparition on the Rotunda wall of the bill's infamous Section 233, a $14 billion tax measure to offset tunnel-repair costs, which is said to have left the representatives cowering and profoundly shaken. "They say if you're alone in the Capitol at midnight, the lights will flicker and all the documents before you momentarily become the dead bill's cover page," said freshman Rep. Sandy Adams (R-FL). "And legend has it that every Feb. 26, on the anniversary of the bill's death, if you look out across the National Mall, you can see the ghostly specter of the Toledo-area two-lane overpass the act was intended to fund. According to congressional lore, the bill's sponsor, the late Rep. Harold Volkmer (D-MO), was driven mad by H.R. 4591's death. Volkmer is said to have become obsessed with the idea of saving the legislation, muttering incessantly to himself for the remainder of his life about how he should have added $240 million in targeted earmarks to win over opponents. Although the 387 members of the 104th Congress who participated in the bill's slaughter reportedly made a pact never to speak of the horrific acts they committed, some, like Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD), have come forward in an effort to ease the guilt they said has weighed on their consciences for over a decade. "I'll never be able to forgive myself for what happened to that poor bill," said Hoyer, who claimed visions of the mutilated legislation still tormented him in his sleep. "It was a good, ambitious bill with such a bright future, but we barely let it out of committee before we viciously hacked it apart. "We just sat there and didn't even give it an up or down vote," added Hoyer, staring stoically at nothing in particular, his voice hushed and trance-like. "We deserve all its wicked vengeance. Despite legislators' widespread belief that the bill is lashing out in wrath from beyond the grave, some have asserted it is time to forget about H.R. 4591 and move on. "What's done is done. There's no use worrying about the bill as there's nothing we can do to end the terrible curse it cast upon us," House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) said. "That is, aside from reviving it and passing it with enough funds to upgrade the nation's transportation infrastructure, thereby allowing the legislation to finally rest in peace. "But let me be clear," Cantor added. "I will never allow such a wasteful spending measure to pass this Congress."

Stunned Family Watches As Grandmother Wolfs Down Sandwich In 33 Minutes
SPOKANE, WA — Claiming they had never seen anything like it before, the stunned family of local grandmother Doreen Weiss reportedly watched in disbelief Wednesday as she wolfed down a sandwich in 33 minutes. "Man, she just stuffed her face and absolutely annihilated that thing," said Weiss's grandson Justin, noting that the family couldn't believe that their grandmother had "inhaled" her chicken salad on rye in just over a half hour. "I wasn't even halfway through my club sandwich, and she was already completely done with her first bite. It was nuts. She even scarfed down a couple of crackers." Justin Weiss went on to say that the family was floored when the 86-year-old "pretty much guzzled" two entire spoonfuls of the tomato soup that came with the sandwich before deciding she would save the rest for lunch and dinner tomorrow.

I Guess When My Older Brother Said 'Let's Bomb The Boston Marathon,' I Should Have Said No
I've had a lot of time to think the last few days as I've been sitting here in my hospital bed. I've reflected on my life and the choices I've made, and I've tried to figure out exactly where things really took a turn for the worse for me. And after much reflection, I think I've finally pinpointed the moment. Given all that's happened over the last week — a shootout with police that left my brother dead, my botched suicide attempt, and my subsequent capture by federal authorities as I lay bleeding to death in a total stranger's yard — I'm starting to think that maybe when Tamerlan first said "Let's bomb the Boston Marathon," I should have said no. Like, maybe if I had said "No, I don't want to do that" when my brother asked me if I wanted to set off a series of deadly explosions that would kill or seriously injure dozens of innocent people, then that might have actually worked out better for me. That's sort of the feeling I'm getting lately, at least. It's funny, you know. As time goes by, the more I'm starting to see how, if you think about it, it's almost like there were two different ways to go at that particular moment and, unfortunately, I might have chosen the wrong way to go. For instance, if I had decided at that moment to, say, immediately warn the police that my brother was plotting to bomb a highly populated public area in the middle of Boston on April 15th, and then if I'd called my parents to let them know their eldest son had become completely mentally unhinged, then perhaps I'd be in a better situation right now. In terms of my life and my future and so forth. Does that make sense? You know how it is, though. You're a young and admittedly impressionable young man and your older brother, whom you love and idolize, comes up to you and says, "Hey, you want to help me brutally terrorize a bunch of innocent men, women, and children on Patriots' Day?" and you sort of just go along with it. I mean, ordinarily, if anyone else had asked me that question I probably would have said something along the lines of, oh, I don't know, "No, that sounds like a really bad idea, and I don't want any part of it." But I didn't, and you know what? I'm sort of regretting it. What can I say, though? Sometimes you make decisions that you realize later weren't as great as they seemed at the time. Like when I decided to steal an SUV and then run over my brother with it after a deadly shootout with law enforcement officials. That's another good example. Or when I shot myself in the throat when FBI agents were closing in on my hiding place. Or when I chose not to turn both myself and Tamerlan in to the authorities the second I saw the carnage and mass pandemonium our actions had caused. All of these, in retrospect, were probably somewhat questionable decisions, now that I've had some time to reflect on them. I don't know. What do other people think? Was saying "Okay, sure" when my brother asked me to help him build makeshift explosives using pressure cookers packed with ball bearings and nails a wise move? And when he told me to put those explosives in a backpack, take them to the Boston Marathon, and blow them up at the finish line in order to destroy the lives of hundreds of people and terrify millions around the country, should I have just said, "No, Tamerlan, this is wrong"? I probably should have, right? Oh well. Live and learn, I guess. Dzhokar A. Tsarnaev

Embarrassed Health Guru Informs Tom Brady He's Been Mistakenly Following Toxic Diet Regimen
BROOKLINE, MA — Rushing into the home of the New England Patriots quarterback and snatching a protein powder shake out of his hand, embarrassed health guru Alex Guerrero reportedly informed Tom Brady Monday that he's been mistakenly following a toxic diet regimen this whole time. "Oh my god, Tom, there's been a mistake — this diet is potentially fatal," said a panicked and humiliated Guerrero before quickly throwing out all the food in Brady's house while informing the two-time NFL MVP that he had recently come across research debunking any health benefits of his strict nutritional habits. "If you don't stop this diet immediately, your muscles will atrophy, your skin is going to wither, and we're looking at multiple organ failures within the next month. Jesus, we've got to get you off of this nightshade-free diet right away. Quick, you need to start eating bread and potatoes. Christ, what the hell were we thinking?" At press time, Guerrero added that Brady's ill-advised workout regimen may actually render him immobile by age 45.

Exhausted Sweatshop Worker Just Has To Laugh After Sewing Fingers Together
PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA — After working her third straight 17-hour shift, garment worker Nghiem Phuong said Monday she "couldn't help but laugh" after sewing her index and ring fingers together. "Well, I guess it's just one of those days," said a chuckling Nghiem, who told reporters she had accidentally run her hand through the industrial sewing machine "like a complete dunderhead" while working on a Seattle Seahawks crewneck sweatshirt. "Luckily, my health insurance will cover it — nah, I'm just joshing. " Nghiem added that she had not laughed so hard at herself since she was 13 and an angry sex trafficker threw her down a flight of stairs for getting pregnant.

Nude Man Who Locked Self Out Of House Delivers Moving Treatise On Human Condition To Slowly Gathering Crowd
ST. CLOUD, MN — Shortly after discovering he had locked himself out of his suburban home, stark naked 43-year-old claims adjuster David Ronzo began to deliver a stirring and thought-provoking philosophical treatise on the frailty of the human condition to a slowly gathering crowd, deeply moved witnesses reported today. Following a brief period during which he panicked — first running to his locked garage door and then scrambling back to pound frantically on his front door — the nude man reportedly stopped, turned to face two confused joggers, and started speaking from his porch in a loud, clear voice. Soon, rapt passersby were steadily thronging his yard. "Yes, it's true; I stand before you naked, exposed to the world — completely vulnerable and without recourse," the nude man said as he calmly drew himself to his full height and looked purposefully at the gradually expanding crowd of his neighbors. "But should I feel deeply ashamed at my misfortune? Should I be the object of your ridicule and derision? I put it to you, dear people, that on all counts, the answer is emphatically no, I most certainly should not be! For who among you can argue that I do not now, stripped of all guile and pretense, represent the very essence of what, in truth, lies at the core of our very humanness, be we mighty kings or lowly claims adjusters?" "I can see it in your faces; you know as well as I do that the only real difference between you and I is a gust of wind and the fact that my robe is still in the wash," added Ronzo, later emphasizing that being a completely naked man locked outside his home in no way diminished his desire to be loved and understood. According to those who stopped to hear him speak, Ronzo spent the next 35 minutes mounting an eloquent, heartfelt plea for his own humanity, for the humanity of all people everywhere, and, briefly, for the importance of keeping a spare key hidden somewhere near the front door of one's home. "Am I frightened? Do I feel confused, utterly abandoned, and left without a clear path forward? I would not be so arrogant as to say otherwise," Ronzo said as those in the crowd nodded their heads in agreement, with some periodically glimpsing at Ronzo's uncovered genitals. "But please, take a moment to look deep within yourselves and answer me honestly: Do you, the fully clothed, really feel any differently? Metaphorically speaking, we are from birth accidentally locked out of the safety and warmth of our respective houses, naked to creation, and, for the remainder of our all-too-brief lives, scared witless at having been thrust into a vast, seemingly indifferent universe of which we comprise a mind-bogglingly infinitesimal part and from which we struggle daily — and cruelly, at the very end, entirely alone — to glean even the simplest fundamental truths." "Debra? Debra? Can you hear me? I locked myself out of the house and I'm naked! Help!" Ronzo continued as he jiggled the door handle. "Debra!" Ronzo reportedly went on to ponder the grim facts of mortality, but concluded his treatise with an uplifting message of faith in the indomitable nature of the human spirit. Many witnesses later said they were moved to tears when, without pausing in his powerful oration, Ronzo resolutely refused a windbreaker offered to him by a man in the crowd. "Please, take a long look and explore the many flaws inherent in the corporeal body; reflect for a moment on how quickly our trivial concerns are brushed aside by decay and change," Ronzo said as he slowly twirled his pale form before the crowd. "Indeed, entropy and chaos constantly bear down on us at every second of every day. To think, at one moment you can be on your way to take a nice, hot shower, and the next your front door can slam behind you after you thought you heard the dog trying to get in. But do not take these simple facts as a curse; view them as an opportunity, as an affirmation of why it is so important to live, and to live lustily, with fire and passion in your hearts! So please, go home, hold your loved ones tightly, and take careful stock of those things that are truly important to you." After enthusiastically cheering and applauding Ronzo as he awkwardly climbed through an unlatched window into his den, several neighbors took time to reflect on the nude man's sobering yet inspiring disquisition on questions central to the human experience. "Here I am, acting all high and mighty with my pants and shirt on, and tomorrow morning I could just as easily be grabbing the paper off the stoop and end up locked outdoors, naked as a jaybird," visibly moved crowd member Chris Dawkins said. "This whole thing really makes you appreciate everything you have, and I know that I for one am not going to take anything for granted anymore." "That nude man changed my life," Dawkins added.

Blissful Ignorance Commemorated On Annual 9/10 Anniversary
NEW YORK — In cities and communities throughout the nation today, Americans gathered by the thousands to commemorate the blissful ignorance of Sept. 10, 2001. "Every year at this time, we pause to remember that momentous late summer day when our nation was united in delightful complacency, utterly oblivious to anything that was happening outside our own borders," New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a 9/10 memorial event, adding that 11 years ago today, Americans were happily unaware of where Afghanistan was on a map or what al-Qaeda was, but happy nonetheless. "None of us should ever forget the events of 9/10 — the Broncos Monday night victory over the Giants, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 2.15 points in moderate trading — which profoundly touched us all by keeping us joyously unmindful of the wider world and the growing anti-American sentiment that was about to be unleashed. We must never forget." As per tradition, the nation's 9/10 ceremonies concluded with the tolling of bells, candle-lightings, and the annual name-reading of those Americans who naively went to bed that night thinking everything would always be okay.

Wife Kept Up All Night By Kevin Garnett Talking Trash In Sleep
NEW YORK — Saying she has still not grown accustomed to the irritating habit despite being married to the Brooklyn Nets power forward for a decade, Brandi Garnett revealed to reporters that she was once again kept up the whole night Thursday by her husband talking trash in his sleep. "I must have woken up four different times from Kevin tossing and turning in bed while calling someone a little bitch who can't fucking score on him," said Garnett, adding that although she tries her best to simply tune out the unconscious trash talking, it generally occurs multiple times per night and can continue for 30 or 40 minutes on end. "At one point I actually thought something was wrong, but then I saw his eyes were shut and he was snoring in between reflexively pounding his chest and mumbling God knows what about an opposing player's wife. The worst was when he screamed 'Get that shit out of here!' at the top of his lungs around four in the morning — I'm honestly surprised he didn't wake himself up." Garnett went on to explain that her husband never has any recollection the next day of having talked trash in his sleep, though he often seamlessly continues cursing out Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah as soon as he wakes up.

HR Director Reminds Employees That Any Crying Done At Office Must Be Work-Related
DECKERVILLE, MI — In an effort to ensure employees stay focused during business hours, Paragon Media human resources director Patty Clemence sent a company-wide email Tuesday reiterating that any crying done at the office must be work-related, sources confirmed. "All personal crying, such as that stemming from household finances or fights with your spouse, should either be taken care of before you arrive at work in the morning or be put off until after 5 p.m.," said Clemence, asking that workers limit openly weeping at their desk or in a bathroom stall to job-oriented topics such as benefits, their workload, or a lack of appreciation among colleagues. "Of course, there are some exceptions to these guidelines. For example, if you happen to be crying because work has prevented you from seeing your family this week, that's a gray area, and you might want to clear it with a supervisor before breaking down completely." Clemence added that anyone with additional concerns about this rule should feel free to come to her and quietly bawl in her office.

Report: Majority Of Money Donated At Church Doesn't Make It To God
WASHINGTON — A shocking report released Monday by the Internal Revenue Service revealed that more than 65 percent of the money donated at churches across the world never reaches God. "Unfortunately, almost half of all collections go toward administrative expenses such as management, utilities, and clerical costs," said Virginia Raeburn, a spokesperson for the Lord Almighty, adding that another 25 percent of heavenly funding is needed just to cover payroll for the angelic hierarchy. "People always assume God is filthy rich, but they'd be surprised to learn His net worth is only around $8 million — and most of that is tied up in real estate. " According to Raeburn, God currently has enough money saved to live comfortably throughout all eternity, but He may be forced to shutter a number of† under-performing religions.

Daily Spin Class Only Thing Keeping Mom From Driving Car Full Of Kids Into Ocean
WALNUT CREEK, CA — Explaining that her workouts at Flywheel Sports always leave her feeling balanced and reenergized, local mother of three Karen Madison told reporters Monday that her daily spin class was the only thing keeping her from driving a car full of her children right into the Pacific Ocean. "I'm stuck in this house all day long, and I swear, if I don't have my five o'clock spinning session, I will load the kids into the van and drive it straight off a dock," said the 37-year-old, who added that just one hour of intense cardio with her instructor allows her to sweat away any stress that would cause her to speed her Honda through barriers along the waterfront and not stop until the vehicle was submerged under 10 feet of seawater. "I can be having the worst week, but once I'm in there spinning alongside [friends] Janet and Kathy, all my anxieties, and bad mood, and impulses to strap the boys into the backseat and plunge into a deep body of water just completely melt away. I don't know what I'd do without those classes." Madison added that the 30 minutes of yoga she performs each week in the family's living room also provide her with the mental clarity she needs to not slowly poison her husband to death.

Report: Bananas Still Most Popular Fruit For Pretending To Receive Phone Call
BALTIMORE — According to a report published Tuesday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, bananas remain the overwhelming fruit of choice among individuals pretending to receive a telephone call. "Our research found that when subjects simulate the act of answering a phone, the banana is their preferred fruit nearly 100 percent of the time," said report co-author Martha Gross, who noted that when people seated near a basket of assorted fruit begin to mimic the sound of a ringing telephone, they almost invariably choose to raise a banana to their ear, eschewing all other fruits. "During our study, we never once observed anyone shouting 'Hello?' into an apple, pausing for several moments as if listening to the other end of a conversation while holding a peach to the side of their face, or slamming down a bunch of grapes while saying 'Click!' For the vast majority of people who hold imaginary phone calls on pieces of fruit, it's either a banana or nothing." The report went on to state that a pear remains the most popular fruit to say "Breaker, breaker!" into and then imitate the static of a CB radio.

Older Prostitute Explains To Younger Prostitute Who Richard Belzer Is, What He Expects
NEW YORK — In an effort to prepare her colleague for an upcoming encounter with the veteran actor Friday night, 41-year-old prostitute Hazel Pierson reportedly sat down with 24-year-old prostitute Lexi Grant to explain exactly who Richard Belzer is and what he expects. The conversation, which sources confirmed took place in the back room of The Playhouse Men's Club in East Queens, touched on the range of specific services the 70-year-old star of Homicide: Life On The Street and Law And Order has come to demand from the various call girls he has employed over the past several decades. "Richard Belzer is one of our best clients, and he expects a high standard of treatment, physically as well as emotionally," Pierson said of the primetime television mainstay, adding that certain details, such as their meeting in his suite at the LaGuardia Airport Marriott, were "non-negotiable." "Make sure you arrive early; if you're even a minute late you won't be called again. And at exactly 6 p.m., he'll open the door a crack." "Just let yourself in quietly and change into the silk négligée he's left on the nightstand," she continued. "Mr. Belzer will signal to you when he's ready." According to sources, after using her phone to show her younger coworker several recent photographs of the actor, Pierson laid out a set of strict guidelines to ensure a successful evening. These reportedly included not asking any questions about Belzer's family life, film career, or 1997 HBO comedy special, and never discussing rates, since he "always pays in full ahead of time." The older escort then reportedly drew from personal experience to convey Belzer's requirement that any girl in his company apply a particular shade of English Rose lipstick and two sprays of Chanel No. 5 — no more, no less — which he typically sets up beforehand on the bathroom vanity. "Look, I remember how nervous I was when Mr. Belzer and I had our first session, but I know you're going to do great." "Sometimes Mr. Belzer will want you to stay the night, and you just have to do it. You'll be compensated, of course," said Pierson, adding that the actor's desire to extend the visit would become evident if he nuzzled up beside Grant and gently stroked her hair. "Basically, if he gets what he wants, he's very tender. Don't worry; there's never been any funny business, and he won't rough you up." "But if he calls you Louise, just go with it," Pierson continued. "Once, a few years ago, I asked what he meant, and he just got dressed and walked out. That's a mistake you don't want to repeat." Over the course of the conversation, sources confirmed that the older escort repeatedly stressed to her less experienced colleague that Belzer's time was highly valuable, detailing an occasion in 1991, around the time he first gained national fame, when one call girl's reluctance to remove a piercing had prompted him to refuse payment and storm off back to the set of the television series The Flash. However, Pierson reportedly suggested that if Grant played her cards right and politely acquiesced to his "very reasonable" sexual demands, she could one day join the elite cadre of escorts favored by the 2008 People's Choice Award nominee. "Look, I remember how nervous I was when Mr. Belzer and I had our first session, but I know you're going to do great," said Pierson, noting that the actor would certainly be infatuated with Grant due to his predilection for thicker thighs. "Just remember that he's pretty well-known, and when he asks for something — whether it's just holding you and looking into your eyes for the whole session, or sending you to the tub so he can watch you bathe — he's going to get it." "All I'm saying is don't go into this thinking it'll be easy," she added. "You can't just push him around the way you would with Sam Waterston."

Study: 96 Percent Of Humans Would Rather Be Animatronic Bear
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA — The University of Virginia published the results of an extensive 18-month study Wednesday revealing that 96 percent of human beings across the planet would strongly prefer to be a singing, dancing animatronic bear. The UVA researchers, who conducted thousands of surveys with residents of 196 different countries, discovered that despite belonging to diverse socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and age groups, nearly all respondents said their ideal existence would involve being an animatronic bear wearing comfy overalls and a big floppy hat. "While analyzing the collected data, we found that an overwhelming number of participants claimed the carefree, down-home life of a robotic bear was far more appealing than their own lives," said Professor Daniel Vaughn, who led the study. "Most expressed a conviction that nothing would be more enjoyable than sitting on a plastic log, strumming a banjo, and singing songs on stage with their goofy animatronic bear friends. Vaughn also noted that many people were attracted to the prospect of an animatronic bear's brief workday, insisting that performing songs for several minutes and then being allowed to power down and sleep for long stretches of time would be superior to a regular job. In addition, study participants said receiving the adoration of young children, attending birthday parties every day, and working in a place that always smelled like fresh-baked pizza had greatly influenced their preference to be an electromechanical bear. "Imagine a life in which there's always a jamboree, it's always a sunny day, and no one ever troubles you for anything," said 46-year-old Cleveland native Charley Hale. "You never have to pay taxes, and all you really have to do is blow in a jug a few times, sing some dumb words, and happily smile away with your pretty animatronic girl bear at your side. "God, why can't that be my life? " Hale added. According to the 320-page study, 96 percent of respondents believe that performing a maximum of six programmed body movements and speaking in a limited number of prerecorded sounds must provide a comforting routine for robot bears, who can relax instead of worrying about what do with their arms and legs, or what to say and think. "You wouldn't even have to open the door to your little bear house, because it's fully automated and pops open by itself," said Mishkat Zia, 34, a resident of Rangpur, Bangladesh. "You just slide out on a rail and don't have to stress out about which way you're going. Plus, you don't need to learn any of the songs, because they put all of that on a computer chip. And they have the air- conditioning blasting all the time. After interviewing thousands of participants, researchers learned that many people envied animatronic bears because they lack brains and are able to lead tranquil lives without ever experiencing doubt, sadness, or pain. The study also found that most people would rather have an animatronic bear's single, smiling facial expression, which seems to indicate constant happiness. Sociologist Diana Norris, who examined and analyzed the data from the survey, found that every person in the study expressed concerns about the frailty of the human body, which they felt was inferior to the animatronic bear's mechanical anatomy. "Participants were very worried about larger human issues like injuries, illnesses, and aging, but also things like sweating too much, getting fat, smelling bad, and feeling sore," said Norris, adding that survey respondents liked the idea of being very soft like a bear. "In addition, most noted that if an animatronic bear did have a problem, a technician would repair it right away. A small percentage said even if they stopped working entirely, they would still rather be a nonfunctioning animatronic bear than a human. Despite such widespread consensus on robotic bears, 4 percent of participants disagreed, saying they would prefer to be a life-sized wax replica of actor Harrison Ford.

Liquor Commercial Featuring Dance Party On Pirate Ship Also Includes Important Message About Responsibility
NEW YORK — According to sources, a recently aired TV ad featuring dozens of rum-guzzling pirates swinging on ropes while dancing with scantily clad women to Caribbean steel-drum music also included a voice-over narration urging viewers to use caution while consuming alcohol. "Please drink responsibly," said the ad's narrator, just seconds after a group of boisterous, maniacally laughing pirates sang a sea chanty and hoisted brimming mugs of alcohol while firing every one of the ship's deck cannons. According to sources, the ad was followed by a commercial in which a child drizzles frosting on a toaster strudel while a narrator says, "part of a balanced breakfast."

Report: Typical City Bus Contains No Fewer Than Four Erections At Any Given Time
WASHINGTON — A report from the U.S. Department of Transportation confirmed Thursday that at any one time, the average American city bus is occupied by at least four fully erect penises. "This persistent level of physical arousal remains a mystery, as we have found no link between these erections and either the attractiveness of fellow passengers or the intensity of vehicle vibrations," the report read in part, also noting that when one of the four engorged penises goes flaccid, another immediately hardens, as if to take its place. "Four is just a minimum, of course. During rush-hour traffic, there may be as many as 21 stiffened members on a single bus, while off-peak erection counts often hover around five or even six. " The report's statistics do not include bus drivers, who are believed to remain constantly erect throughout their shifts.

Bloodied, Bruised John Kerry Emerges Victorious At Kickboxing Tournament In Bangkok Prison
BANGKOK — Spitting out a broken tooth as his opponent lay motionless on the bare cement floor, a battered Secretary of State John Kerry emerged victorious Wednesday evening from an underground kickboxing tournament at Bangkok's notorious Bang Kwang Central Prison, sources reported. "Any other takers?" said the sweat-drenched U.S. cabinet official in perfectly accented Thai, unwrapping the blood-soaked cloths from his hands and feet as spectators showered him in crumpled 20-, 50-, and 100-baht bills. "I certainly hope there's someone else out there who's better at muay thai than that last fellow. I was under the impression they took their kickboxing seriously in these parts." When no one else stepped forward to square off against him, Kerry departed, and was reportedly seen socializing at a black-tie diplomatic gala at the American embassy 90 minutes later.

Gaunt, Sickly Kirby Takes Leave Of Absence From Video Games Following Stomach Cancer Diagnosis
DREAM LAND — With large bags under his oval-shaped eyes and his skin a pallid shade of bubblegum pink, a gaunt, sickly Kirby announced Wednesday that he would be taking a leave of absence from video games after being diagnosed with stomach cancer. "After a biopsy by Dr. Mario discovered a series of tumors along my gastrointestinal tract, I received a diagnosis of stage IV stomach cancer and will be taking an immediate and indefinite hiatus from all fighting, puzzle, and racing games," said the pink puff, his voice frail as he explained that the tests from HAL Laboratory attributed the diagnosis to complications from frequently inhaling oversized enemies, eating over 40,000 calories of junk food — including whole hams, pizzas, and cakes — on a daily basis, and inflating his stomach to serve as a buoyant flight device. "I was so focused on obtaining all the Crystal Shards and ridding Mirror World of Shadow Kirby, I didn't realize how much I was neglecting my health. I wish it hadn't gotten to this point before I fully understood that I should cut back on shooting fireballs out of my mouth or maybe take it easy with the Maxim Tomatoes." At press time, King Dedede and Meta Knight had issued a joint statement saying they would not hatch any diabolical schemes on Planet Pop Star out of respect for their ailing colleague and wished him a speedy recovery.

76 Million Baby Boomers Abscond To Fiji After Draining Nation's Social Security, Medicare Accounts
WOODLAWN, MD — Arriving en masse to the Pacific island nation after fleeing under the cover of night, 76 million baby boomers reportedly escaped to Fiji on Friday after completely draining the nation's Social Security and Medicare accounts. Sources said the daring $3.1 trillion operation was discovered early this morning as stunned federal employees checked both programs' reserves only to find that each now held a total of $0.00, the apparent culmination of a plan that reportedly was meticulously organized and executed over the last 30 years. "It's gone, all gone, they completely cleaned us out," said Social Security director Nancy Berryhill, revealing that airport security cameras had caught every American born between 1946 and 1964, having emptied the U.S. social safety net, boarding red-eye flights to Fiji. "These people were using our nation's wealth as their personal piggy bank for decades, just waiting for the right moment to make their move and take us for everything we were worth." Shocked citizens from around the country were forced to contemplate how they could ever replace the funds they had been counting on for their own healthcare and retirement income. "The way they acted so sweet all these years — how could we not see this coming?" she added. "Those selfish sons of bitches were working us the whole time!" According to sources, the entirety of Medicare and Social Security was slowly siphoned off as the post-war generation built trust by assuring the other 240 million Americans that they would collect their share eventually. However, since decamping, observers say the baby boomers have spent the funds on opulent lifestyles in the tropics where they intend to live out the rest of their days relaxing in comfort, all at the expense of the children and grandchildren they reportedly claimed to be concerned about. "We thought they were our friends, neighbors, and loved ones, but clearly they've just been enriching their own coffers for years," said Berryhill, adding that it was now apparent that despite their "inspirational hot air" about investing in the country's future, the baby boomers only really cared about themselves. "As we speak, they're probably cruising along in their European sports cars to the beachfront condos they bought with our money, laughing at how naïve we all were." "And we fell for their scheme," she continued. "How could we have been so foolish?" As they awoke to find the baby boomers gone, shocked citizens from around the country were forced to contemplate how, and even if, they could ever replace the funds they had been counting on for their own healthcare and retirement income. Speaking to reporters, many expressed anger and disbelief that their hard-earned money would be used to pay not for their own basic living expenses, but instead for expensive new wardrobes, luxury hotel suites, and sunset champagne cruises to private Fijian lagoons. "In retrospect it now seems obvious why they were skimming off a little piece of my paycheck every month," said Roland Jensen of Rochester, MN, noting how his town was left strewn with abandoned homes, each containing notes hastily taped to front doors that simply read "Thanks for everything — xoxo." "They always did think they were better than us, that their generation was somehow special. And now those bastards are an ocean away enjoying their perfect tropical paradise while we're left footing the bill." "We may never recover after what they did to this country," he added.

Report: 2012 Election Likely To Be Decided By 4 Or 5 Key Swing Corporations
WASHINGTON — With polls this week showing the race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney tightening even further, a growing number of political experts have declared this year's election will almost certainly be decided by a small handful of swing corporations. "While most publicly traded companies are solidly red or blue, there are four or five major corporations that are complete tossups right now, and any one of them could prove decisive come November," said Nate Silver of The New York Times, noting in particular that Procter & Gamble, a traditional bellwether for the country as a whole, remained a "total wildcard. " "Both candidates will have to focus almost exclusively on these swing businesses in order to gain the upper hand. "And given how close this race is, I wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing comes down to undecided executives at Dow Chemical or Disney," Silver continued. "Let's not forget 2000, when Philip Morris International single-handedly put George W. Bush into office. According to polling data, the president's favorability has fallen steadily among independent-leaning multinationals, a demographic that effectively carried him to victory in 2008. Additionally, the latest figures suggest that even some reliably Democratic strongholds, such as Google, may now be in play, buoying hopes within the Romney camp that the GOP challenger could take the White House with an unexpected victory in a key tech boardroom. Recognizing the importance of these closely contested conglomerates, both Obama and Romney have made frequent campaign stops at swing corporations in recent weeks and delivered speeches aimed squarely at these pivotal companies' interests, with both candidates blasting each other as out of touch with the issues that truly matter to real American CEOs. "As president, I promise to stand up for you in Washington and always put you first," Romney said earlier this week, addressing an audience in the battleground boardroom of Time Warner during a barnstorming tour through the communications sector. "All of you good, hardworking people gathered here represent the best of America, and mark my words, I will do everything in my power to fight for your freedoms and prosperity. Political observers have noted the stakes of this year's election are unusually high, with many experts claiming the Affordable Care Act's fate, the tax burden on American families, and a possible U.S. invasion of Iran are questions that now reside entirely in the hands of those few Fortune 500 corporations that remain up for grabs. "I went with Obama in 2008, but now I'm having my doubts," said Kenneth Frazier, an undecided CEO at the Merck corporation. "Frankly, I've been disappointed with his failure to follow through on the promises he made to us four years ago. This time around, I want to make sure I'm voting for someone who truly has the best interests of me and my company at heart. "It's kind of exciting, though," Frazier added. "Who knows? Maybe in November it will be our $15 million backing funneled anonymously into a political action committee that decides this whole thing.

Customer Who Declined Initial Offer Of Assistance From Floor Salesman Comes Crawling Back
MINNEAPOLIS — Mere minutes after rejecting a Home Depot employee's offer of assistance with a curt shake of his head and the phrase "No thanks," local man Garrett Hoffman, 44, reportedly came crawling back for help Monday. "Excuse me, I'm looking for foam sealant," said Hoffman, returning with his tail between his legs to the very same salesman he had just moments earlier arrogantly brushed aside as he strode with unfounded confidence down the plumbing aisle. "I looked next to the fiberglass insulation but didn't see it there, and it wasn't by the other spray products, either. Maybe it's in the back?" At press time, the once cocksure customer was barely able to raise his head to look the floor salesman in the eye as he returned a second time to meekly request help getting the sanded plywood down from the top shelf.

Ira Glass Exhausted From Doing Every Single Voice On 'This American Life'
NEW YORK — Revealing that the creative demands of the long-running public radio program take a substantial toll, Ira Glass told reporters Thursday that he was exhausted from single-handedly doing all the voices for each episode of This American Life. Glass, who has personally recorded the vocal tracks for every reporter, essayist, and interviewee character since the show debuted in 1995, confirmed that after 539 episodes, the labor-intensive process leaves him feeling fatigued and mentally drained by the end of each week's broadcast. "I have to say, I still love doing the program, and I embrace the challenge of creating different kinds of stories populated by interesting and unusual characters, but that undertaking can definitely wear you out," said Glass, who sipped from a mug of honey-lemon tea while recalling the long 18- to 20-hour days spent alone in the recording studio. "Just to be clear, there's nothing more rewarding than coming up with all these new characters every week. I delve in, play around with my voice, and experiment with a dialect or fine-tune a cadence until I capture exactly what, for example, a superior court judge or 12-year-old sleepaway camper should sound like." "The emotional investment involved in performing as an African-American schoolteacher struggling with budget cuts or a grown woman just learning she was switched at birth can be extremely taxing," said Glass. "You have to go into that space and inhabit that character all day long. I'm usually dead tired by the end of the week, but there's a satisfaction — fulfillment, really — when I turn on the radio and hear all of my voices in a completed show." Despite the onerous workload and threat of burnout, Glass said that he is still driven to build out a new fictional world each week filled with the ambitious journalists, Jeep dealership salespeople, sage panhandlers, deceitful children, aircraft carrier personnel, FBI informants, self-conscious lucha libre wrestlers, former hostages, and overly divulging fathers that are beloved by fans of This American Life. Glass told reporters that, several years ago, he challenged himself to create as many fleshed-out characters as possible in the episode "20 Acts In 60 Minutes," noting that he spent several weeks alone writing and recording an emotional song of apology performed by a few dozen teenage girls at a detention center, all of whom were meticulously voiced by Glass. "I set aside a considerable amount of time to build a character, perfecting the vocal qualities, and figuring out what makes them tick," Glass said. "Back in 1992, before This American Life, when I was working on the Chicago Public Radio program The Wild Room, I was tinkering around with a new voice that had a hint of a Southern drawl and a slight lisp. But it wasn't until I raised the pitch, modified the inflection, added a self-deprecating delivery, and devised a background about growing up in a large Greek family in North Carolina that I had this great, urbane humorist character." "And that's how David Sedaris was born," Glass added. Glass, who never digitally alters his vocal performances, relies on time-consuming manual techniques to shape the sounds on his program, such as speaking into a Styrofoam cup to mimic the degraded sound quality of a secret tape recording for a recent segment on the relationship between Wall Street bankers and federal regulators. Moreover, Glass said he taught himself a significant amount of Cantonese to accurately portray the characters he had scripted for the episode "Mr. Daisey And The Apple Factory." Though Glass records most of the characters separately and then edits the tracks together later, the 55-year-old confirmed that he tapes some interviews in real time, rapidly switching back and forth between two or more characters. The This American Life creator said that the task was easiest with well-worn recurring characters, like producer Nancy Updike. "Doing all the voices for interviews is certainly challenging from a physical standpoint, but nothing like having to create an entire crowd," Glass said. "For the Harper High episodes last year, I came up with 352 different high school student characters. Those were particularly tough to record — I barely got through them. I lost my voice for two weeks after creating that pep rally." "I actually conceived this lovable freshman named Spud for that show who I really liked who I ended up having to cut in editing," he added. "Hopefully I can bring him back for a story on navigating through the peculiarities of adolescence or maybe mother-son relationships." Adding to his exhaustion each week, Glass said he'll often head into an adjacent studio to record and mix some plaintive tremolo guitar tracks for in between acts, followed by several hours in a foley studio where he might use a metal rake to produce the sound of a chain-link fence creaking or press down on a leather bag filled with corn starch to mimic the crunch of snow underfoot. "It's certainly a lot of work, and I rarely get enough sleep, but I wouldn't still be doing it after 19 years if I didn't love it," he said. "The hardest part is that I don't even know who the real Ira Glass is anymore."

Neighbors Come Together To Watch BMW Owner Struggle In Snow
EVANSTON, IL — Putting aside their own responsibilities and quickly gathering at their neighbor's driveway, Foster Street residents reportedly came together Monday to watch a BMW owner struggle to free his car from the snow. "I threw on a coat and headed outside as soon as I saw that his car was really stuck," said neighborhood resident David Rinaldi, who immediately stopped what he was doing to join other locals and passersby who had assembled for a better view of the frustrated driver revving the luxury vehicle's engine and spinning the tires in vain. "His car wasn't going anywhere, so I knew I should come out and get a good look at him barely moving back and forth as his BMW made loud screeching noises." Rinaldi confirmed that the BMW owner had done the same for him in the past.

Local Man Not Sure How He Ended Up In Boxing Entourage
LAS VEGAS — Perplexed and disoriented as he accompanied WBO light heavyweight champion Sergey "Krusher" Kovalev to the ring at the MGM Grand Garden Arena Saturday, local man Derek Hoff confirmed to reporters that he has absolutely no idea how he wound up in the boxer's entourage. "I was just sort of walking around outside the casino, and the next thing I know I'm caught up in a big swarm of guys heading down to the ring," said the 43-year-old claims adjuster, adding that amid the flurry of lights and blaring music inside the arena, he was somehow outfitted in a sponsor's T-shirt and then found himself holding a title belt over his head while walking behind Kovalev. "Two minutes later, I'm holding down the ropes with my foot while he climbs into the ring. I didn't really know what was happening, so I kind of just stood quietly in his corner until everyone else went to go sit ringside." According to sources, Hoff was equally confused immediately after the fight when he was given a handgun and guided into the back of a limousine bound for a nearby strip club.

Modern Science Still Only Able To Predict One Upcoming Tetris Block
CAMBRIDGE, MA — During a press conference Thursday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, leading members of the scientific community confirmed that despite decades of research, the best available theoretical models still cannot predict more than one upcoming Tetris block. While they have long possessed the technology to accurately forecast and display which of the seven distinct Tetris shapes, or tetrominoes, will appear next, scientists told reporters they've so far had no success determining what any of the blocks beyond the immediate successor will be. "Modern supercomputers have now reached speeds of 30 quadrillion calculations per second, but even with all that processing power, we're no closer to solving this problem than we were a generation ago," said MIT professor Michael Haemlin, who has studied tetromino sequencing since 1984. "Right now our most sophisticated equations can correctly predict two upcoming blocks just one out of every seven times, which unfortunately is no better than the result achieved by random guessing." "So for years, all we've been able to do is rotate each descending shape 90 degrees at a time, control its lateral movement, accelerate the speed of its descent if desired, and simply hope for the best," Haemlin added. According to researchers, the ability to predict two, three, or four incoming shapes would be "nothing short of revolutionary," allowing blocks to be stacked in more optimal patterns in order to achieve the goal of eliminating horizontal lines as efficiently as possible. For example, with enough advanced warning of an arriving I-shaped piece, scientists said they could in theory prepare the Tetris matrix in such a way that up to four rows are cleared simultaneously, with many stating this was one of the ultimate goals of their rigorous stacking trials. "Over the past 30 years, we've developed a much better understanding of how blocks fit together," said Dr. Florence Edelman, the designer of a well-known Tetris experiment in 1993 in which a perfect slot for an L or zigzag block was created under carefully controlled conditions, only to be closed off when a series of ill-fitting square pieces appeared instead. "But without a working predictive model, our entire field of study is at an impasse. Indeed, reaching unpassable standstills is well chronicled in trial after trial." "Some of the world's most brilliant scientific minds have dedicated their lives to unlocking this mystery, yet for all their knowledge and expertise, it's still anyone's guess what will happen five or 10 seconds into the future," Edelman continued. "Once that last bit of uncertainty has been eliminated, we believe our interactions within the Tetris matrix will be far more successful." Edelman stated that many aspects of Tetris are indeed predictable, noting that workers in her lab had discovered that each falling piece is consistently composed of four individual tiles; that the speed at which descents occur increase in direct proportion to total time elapsed; that pieces with the same shape also share the same color; and that while the color of a piece is not particularly important, its shape is of vital significance. Foreknowledge of those shapes, she explained, could lead to a breakthrough phenomenon she described as "a perpetual Tetris" of unlimited duration. "While this remains entirely hypothetical at this moment, there exists a theoretical point at which the elimination of bottom rows occurs with such speed and efficiency that there is always enough room at the top of the matrix to accommodate new pieces," Edelman said. "This would create a fluid and sustainable Tetris that could exist indefinitely — perhaps forever. It would of course still require continuous human maintenance, but it would be a monumental step in the right direction." "For now, though," she added. "We'll simply keep trying and see how far we are able to progress."

Man's Anxiety Not About To Let Depression Muscle In On Turf
PHOENIX — Unwilling to cede decades of hard-won advances, local man Roger Cannon's persistent anxiety vowed Monday that it would not let clinical depression muscle in on any of its turf. "Look, I've had a vise-grip on this guy for 30 years, so I'm not about to roll over now and let some despondent feelings and an overriding aversion to activity waltz in and take over his emotional state," said the mental disorder, adding that it would "crank up" Cannon's irrational worrying, restlessness, and agitation to drive depression out of its territory once and for all. "Roger's mental condition is my domain. And if all-encompassing thoughts of hopelessness and inadequacy think they can parade around like they own the place, trust me, they've got another thing coming." The neurosis then promised that it wouldn't make the same mistake it did in 2011, when it briefly let its guard down and disastrously allowed happiness to take hold.

'Breaking Bad' Ends With Reveal That Whole Series Was Plot Of Book Marie Shoplifted
LOS ANGELES — Capping off five seasons of critically acclaimed television, the AMC series Breaking Bad concluded its run Sunday night with the shocking revelation that the entirety of the show's story — from Walter White's diagnosis with cancer to his transformation into a ruthless methamphetamine kingpin — was in fact merely the plotline of a crime novel that character Marie Schrader had shoplifted from a local bookstore. "What I wanted to create for the finale was an uncompromising conclusion focused on the show's true emotional core: Marie's kleptomania," show creator Vince Gilligan said of the episode's revelatory last scene, in which flashbacks to beloved moments from the show are intercut with shots of Marie flipping to chapters in the novel such as "Heisenberg's New Hat," "Trouble With Gus," and "The Train Robbery." "From day one of writing the show, I knew exactly how the story would play out: with virtually all of its central characters other than Marie — including Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Saul Goodman, everyone — revealed to be fictitious figures in a paperback thriller Marie felt compelled to slip into her jacket in an Albuquerque-area Barnes & Noble. Marie uses this pulp crime novel to help herself deal with the guilt she has stemming from her own very real criminal behavior, which she tries desperately to hide from her husband, local mineralogist Hank Schrader." Gilligan told reporters he is especially pleased with the final shot of the series, in which Marie closes the stolen book, revealing it had been titled Breaking Bad all along.

Quiet Temp Actually Very Untalented Singer-Songwriter
PITTSBURGH — Having established a reputation among the Flagstone Marketing staff as a quiet and reserved temporary worker, Kevin Bright completely shocked his coworkers this week when it was discovered that, outside the office, the mild-mannered 27-year-old is actually an embarrassingly unskilled singer-songwriter. "I don't think Kevin's said more than five words to me in the month he's been here, so I was really surprised to find out he has this whole pitiful music hobby on the side," said account executive Sandra Hutchinson, 39, who was among several employees that happened by chance to attend one of the soft-spoken and largely forgettable temp's horrendous sets at a local coffee shop Tuesday. "But as it turns out, he's actually quite the shitty performer and plays his own unbearable songs at open mics around the city. Who knew?" "He never let on he had such a lack of talent," Hutchinson added. Citing the fact that Bright typically keeps to himself and sits through office meetings without saying a word, those who witnessed his performance this week said they were "totally astonished" when the seemingly introverted worker took the stage and not only sang like garbage, but also played terrible guitar and harmonica as well. "Kevin's such an unassuming guy, you just wouldn't think to look at him that he'd have a great voice or any stage presence, and you'd be right," said graphic designer Paul McDonough, 34, who acknowledged he was "blown away" upon learning that Bright utterly embarrasses himself at music venues one or two nights a week. "I guess underneath his shy and withdrawn exterior, he's an incompetent entertainer with no musical sensibility whatsoever." "Now it makes complete sense why he kept this from us," McDonough continued. "He really sucks." Bright's coworkers told reporters they never would have guessed a retiring, seemingly meek personality would be capable of writing original compositions so utterly devoid of the basic elements that constitute a good song, nor that he would, amazingly, prove equally clumsy and inept with cover versions of classic songs by Neil Young and Elliott Smith. Numerous sources noted they were particularly unimpressed by the shy, inexpressive temp's lyrics, which possessed a stunningly trite quality seldom found even in the very worst of songwriters. Additionally, company sources said they were astounded to discover that Bright, who tends to avoid social interactions at the office and is said to eat lunch alone in his cubicle each day, has his own web page where visitors are able to stream or download his poorly performed and equally poorly recorded music, putting his pathetically meager artistic abilities out there for the world to reject. After learning about the previously unseen and insufferable facet of Bright's personality, Flagstone employees said they did not suddenly view him as a more complex individual. Moreover, they all unanimously agreed they had no desire to learn more about what he does outside of work, acknowledging they had even less interest in him now than before. "Sometimes quiet people have a lot to say when they open up, but Kevin's actually just as empty and bland as we all suspected," said company vice president Ellen Hale, 43, citing Bright's total lack of stage presence as "truly a sight to behold." "Before, I wanted him to come out of his shell, but now I'd rather he continue to keep everything all bottled up inside as he clearly doesn't have anything worthwhile to offer." Admitting that he initially had a hard time speaking up at work, Bright said he has become more comfortable and open at the office since revealing his hidden and truly god-awful creative side. "It's great to finally find something that I can talk with everyone else about," said Bright, whose songs are often mockingly sent around the office in staff emails. "It took a while, but I feel like everybody at Flagstone knows who I am now. In fact, a bunch of people in the office have already told me they're coming to my next show." Numerous Flagstone employees confirmed Bright's statement, saying they "simply have to" see one of the temp's upcoming performances so that they could all laugh at his shitty fucking music in person before his eight-week stint comes to an end.

Future U.S. History Students: 'It's Pretty Embarrassing How Long You Guys Took To Legalize Gay Marriage'
DECATUR, IL, THE YEAR 2083 — According to students in Mr. Bernard's fourth-period U.S. history class, it's "really pathetic" how long it took for early-21st-century Americans to finally legalize gay marriage. The classroom of 15-year-olds at MacArthur High School — all of whom were born in the late 2060s and grew up never questioning the obvious fact that homosexual couples deserve the right to get married — were reportedly "amazed" to learn in their Modern U.S. History: 2081 Edition textbooks that as late as the 2020s, gays and lesbians actually had to fight for the constitutional right to wed. "Wow, that is nuts," said student Jeremy Golliver, who claimed he knew gay rights was a struggle "like, a hundred years ago" but didn't realize it lasted so long. "It's really embarrassing, when you think about it. Just the fact that people in this century were actually saying things like, 'No, gays should not be allowed to marry,' and were getting all up in arms about it, as if homosexuals weren't full citizens or something. It's insane. "I mean, was everybody just a huge bigot back then or what? " Golliver added. The late-21st-century high schoolers told reporters that while many of them had seen depictions of the struggle for gay rights in "old movies" such as Milk, it was "bizarre" to read about how, just 70 or so years ago in the 2010s, many Americans truly thought that gay marriage would somehow destroy the fabric of the country. "There were apparently these really important senators named John McCain and John Kerry who said that marriage should only be between a man and a woman," said a visually baffled Kevin Wu-Picarsic, adding that he couldn't imagine people like that actually being in charge of the country. "I guess in the end I feel really bad for gay people back then who loved each other and wanted to get married. What a sucky time to live. After breaking into study groups to examine chapter 21 of their textbooks — covering the period from the financial collapse of 2019 to the end of the war in Afghanistan — Mr. Bernard's students spent much of the class period discussing, in disbelief, how even supposedly liberal U.S. presidents of the era were "too afraid, apparently" to publicly endorse gay marriage. "If they thought it was the right thing to do, why didn't President Clinton or Obama or whoever just say, 'Hey, discriminating against gay people is wrong, so let's let them get married'?" said Pete Merriam, 15, who was born in an age with no death penalty and with nationwide approval of a woman's right to choose. "I get that they wanted to be reelected or whatever, but come on. That is so stupid. "And look, our textbooks say civil rights legislation was passed in the 1960s, but then it somehow took another three generations to legalize gay marriage? " added classmate Jennifer Goldberg, laughing. "How does that even make sense? Oh my God, and those civil union things were ridiculous, too. Just let gay people get married already! Upon learning that gay marriage actually had to go to the Supreme Court, where it barely passed in a controversial 5-to-4 decision, students from the class of 2086 speculated that "maybe people were just dumber [in the early 2000s]," at which point student Eminem Robertson began to loudly impersonate a bumbling Supreme Court justice from the turn of the century, eliciting loud laughs of approval from classmates. Mr. Bernard, 58, told the class that he himself could remember how in the 2030s gay marriage was still a somewhat touchy subject in certain parts of the country. "It's true," said Mr. Bernard, gesturing to a holographic projection of late-20th/early-21st-century antigay preacher Fred Phelps on the classroom's V-screen. "Most people had come around by the time I was your age, of course, but you would still read and hear things about how certain people in New Washington were trying to overturn the court's ruling. Hard to imagine anyone being that adamant about gays not marrying, but those were different times. "In fact, I remember President Romney even gave this speech once calling gay marriage 'an issue that continues to divide many in our nation, including myself,'" Mr. Bernard continued. "Of course, that was before his openly gay son, Craig, served four terms as president a couple decades later. While the future students, roughly one in eight of whom were raised by gay or lesbian parents, are scheduled to write essays debating the different viewpoints on gay marriage in the 2010s, a number of them told reporters it was hard to conceive of arguments against something as clearly justified as gay marriage "as though it were some big controversial issue, like marrying your clone. After concluding the week's examination of the history of gay marriage rights, classroom sources in the year 2083 said they would be moving on to the topic of how their grandparents' generation was too late to do anything about global warming.

Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex
TOPEKA, KS — Planned Parenthood announced Tuesday the grand opening of its long-planned $8 billion Abortionplex, a sprawling abortion facility that will allow the organization to terminate unborn lives with an efficiency never before thought possible. During a press conference, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards told reporters that the new state-of-the-art fetus-killing facility located in the nation's heartland offers quick, easy, in-and-out abortions to all women, and represents a bold reinvention of the group's long-standing mission and values. "Although we've traditionally dedicated 97 percent of our resources to other important services such as contraception distribution, cancer screening, and STD testing, this new complex allows us to devote our full attention to what has always been our true passion: abortion," said Richards, standing under a banner emblazoned with Planned Parenthood's new slogan, "No Life Is Sacred." "And since Congress voted to retain our federal funding, it's going to be that much easier for us to maximize the number of tiny, beating hearts we stop every day. "The Abortionplex's high-tech machinery is capable of terminating one pregnancy every three seconds," Richards added. "That's almost a million abortions every month. We're so thrilled! The 900,000-square-foot facility has more than 2,000 rooms dedicated to the abortion procedure. The abundance of surgical space, Richards said, will ensure that women visiting the facility can be quickly fitted into stirrups without pausing to second-guess their decision or consider alternatives such as adoption. Hundreds of on-site counselors are also available to meet with clients free of charge and go over the many ways that carrying a child to term will burden them and very likely ruin their lives. The remaining space is dedicated to amenities such as coffee shops, bars, dozens of restaurants and retail outlets, a three-story nightclub, and a 10-screen multiplex theater — features intended not only to help clients relax, but to foster a sense of community and make abortion more of a social event. "We really want abortion to become a regular part of women's lives, especially younger women who have enough fertile years ahead of them to potentially have dozens of abortions," said Richards, adding that the Abortionplex would provide shuttle service to and from most residences, schools, and shopping malls in the region. "Our hope is for this facility to become a regular destination where a woman in her second trimester can whoop it up at karaoke and then kick back while we vacuum out the contents of her uterus. "All women should feel like they have a home at the Abortionplex," Richards continued. "Whether she's a high school junior who doesn't want to go to prom pregnant, a go-getter professional who can't be bothered with the time commitment of raising a child, or a prostitute who knows getting an abortion is the easiest form of birth control — all are welcome. Nineteen-year-old Marcy Kolrath, one of the Abortionplex's first clients, told reporters that despite her initial hesitancy, she was quickly put at ease by staff members who reassured her that she could have abortions over and over for the next decade before finally committing to motherhood. Kolrath also said she was "wowed" by the facility's many attractions. "I was kind of on the fence in the beginning," she said. "But after a couple of margaritas and a ride down the lazy river they've got circling the place, I got caught up in the vibe. By the time it was over, I almost wished I could've aborted twins and gotten to stay a little longer. "I told my boyfriend we had to have sex again that very night," Kolrath added. "I really want to come back over Labor Day."

'I'm A Trump-Era Conservative,' Says Horrifying Man 25 Years From Now
NEWPORT BEACH, CA — Explaining that the early–21st century Republican is by far the biggest influence on his political beliefs, Brandon Taggart, a man from 25 years in the future and all-around horrifying human being, told reporters Wednesday that he considers himself to be a Trump-era conservative. "When I think of what it truly means to be a conservative, I immediately think of Donald Trump and the vision he had for this country," said the deeply frightening individual, adding that the policies and worldview advocated by Trump continue to form the bedrock of his own political convictions more than two decades later. "Nobody since Trump has captured the imagination of an entire generation of voters the way he did back then — not just Republicans, but independents and even a few Democrats, who just got sick of government as usual and wanted America to be strong again." "Trump was the leader this nation needed," added the atrocious man. "We desperately need another one just like him." Taggart, the terrifying ignoramus who in the year 2041 will repeatedly lament a GOP that had lost sight of its ideals, went on to say that he regards the era in which Trump was the face of the Republican Party as the pinnacle not only of modern conservatism but also the United States as a whole. Hailing Trump as an iconic figure of unparalleled wisdom and foresight, the horrendous yet disturbingly principled Taggart added that the upcoming 2044 election desperately needed a true Trump Republican in the field, a leader who would stand up for real Americans and bring back a country they could believe in once again. "The reason Trump's message resonated with so many of us is because he gave us something pure, something that could really galvanize conservatives like me," said Taggart, voicing just one of his many revolting opinions. "He spoke directly to millions of us in the silent majority who felt like we'd been left out in the cold by political correctness. He was gonna get tough against our enemies with no apologies whatsoever." Reflecting with unsettling disillusionment on the two-plus decades of politicians since Trump, Taggart — who, sources reiterated, is awful — bemoaned the fact that there no longer existed anyone who showed a true commitment to Trump's core beliefs. "You'll hear politicians paying lip service to Trump nowadays, but most of them don't have an ounce of the leadership he had," said Taggart in characteristic appalling fashion. "They want to pick and choose which of Trump's policies they support, but it doesn't work like that. A lot of people want to wear the Trump mantle, but nobody has even come close to being the full package of strength, determination, and conservative values. This nation squandered his legacy, but some of us still believe." Added Taggart, "A lot of us, actually."

CHARLESTON, SC — In the hours following a violent rampage in downtown Charleston in which a lone attacker killed nine individuals and seriously injured one other, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Wednesday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place.
"This was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there's nothing anyone can do to stop them," said Oklahoma resident Kenneth Barrows, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world's deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations. There really wasn't anything that was going to keep this guy from snapping and killing a lot of people if that's what he really wanted." At press time, residents of the only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past five and a half years were referring to themselves and their situation as "helpless."

Nationals GM Introduces Players To New Stepmanager
WASHINGTON — Hoping to ease the team into a new period of transition, Washington Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo took a moment Wednesday to introduce his players to their new stepmanager. "Everyone, this is Dale. You're going to be seeing a lot more of him from now on, and I want you make him feel nice and welcome," said Rizzo of the new addition to the National League East club, explaining that the team may have noticed him hanging around recently and joining in on team dinners in the past weeks, and that he would now officially be a permanent fixture of the dugout. "We want to make him a part of the Nationals family. Just give him a chance, and you'll see that he cares about you just as much as any other manager would — so I want you to give him all your attention and respect. We know you love your normal manager, but Dale cares about you, too. That means no sass and no pranks, got it?" At press time, the Nationals' new stepmanager had been overheard referring to several outfielders as "a bunch of little shits," after they forgot to clean up their helmets after batting practice.

Supreme Court Releases Young Scalia's Audition Tape
WASHINGTON — Longtime fans of Associate Justice Antonin Scalia were rewarded Monday when the U.S. Supreme Court released to the public archival footage of the jurist's pivotal 1986 audition for a seat on the nation's highest court. According to legal scholars, the previously unseen video, which features a fresh-faced 50-year-old Scalia sporting a shock of flowing jet-black hair and energetically riffing on the framers' original intent, provides an early glimpse of the developing talents of the up-and-coming judge, who would eventually emerge as one of the nation's preeminent interpreters of constitutional law. "He was still pretty green then, but even so, you could tell he had a lot of raw talent — he absolutely killed with this prepared bit he did on the Commerce Clause," said retired justice John Paul Stevens, who in the tape can be heard off-camera playing the role of a dissenting judge as Scalia is tasked with analyzing the constitutional underpinnings of Roe v. Wade. "Watching it now, his take on the Second Amendment seems really rough, but you can see how he would eventually develop that early concept into his famous District of Columbia v. Heller majority opinion." "There was something special there, even if he stumbled a little while citing key provisions from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure," Stevens added. "Of course, at the time he was only a couple decades out of law school." "He was a little wild, that's for sure, but you could tell he was ambitious. I remember thinking, 'Man, this guy is the most determined statutory textualist I've ever seen.' Recorded before an audience of high-ranking officials that included all nine members of the Burger Court, Attorney General Ed Meese, and senior White House staff, the 30-minute video shows Scalia being put through the paces of the Supreme Court's legendarily difficult auditioning process, which consists of rigorous mock hearings and jurisprudence drills, as well as a cold read from a randomly chosen amicus curiae brief, all performed on the institution's famed courtroom floor. Though his aggressive style of oral argument was still unpolished at the time, and there were no openings currently available on the court, Scalia was reportedly told his name would be kept in mind in the event a spot opened up. Ultimately, experts have said, the tryout opened doors for the fledgling jurist by allowing him to showcase his now-trademark originalism, noting in particular a segment of the tape in which he delivers what onlookers described as a memorable five-minute, extemporaneous oration on the constitutional illegitimacy of gay rights and the Miranda rule. "I'd previously been out with our scouts to see him judge at the D.C. Circuit once or twice," said former Supreme Court clerk H. Geoffrey Moulton, referring to the court of appeals that has famously served as a talent incubator for the federal judiciary, providing many future justices — including judicial legends John Roberts, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the popular Fred M. Vinson — with a place to hone their skills. "He was a little wild, that's for sure, but you could tell he was ambitious. I remember thinking, 'Man, this guy is the most determined statutory textualist I've ever seen.' "So, we decided to bring him in for an audition to see what he could do," Moulton continued. "Some of my colleagues felt he was still too wet behind the ears, but I was interested to find out how he'd perform on a bigger stage." A few months later, Scalia would get that chance when the Supreme Court needed a new justice and the U.S. Senate unanimously approved his nomination. When told by reporters that his audition tape had been released, Scalia admitted that he himself hadn't been very impressed with his performance at the time, noting in particular that he "bombed" his interpretation of the state action doctrine. "Oh, wow, they dug up that old video?" said a chuckling Scalia, who recalled that he was so nervous during his tryout he "practically sweat through [his] robes." "I can only imagine what people in that room were thinking when this Italian kid from Queens came in there quoting those clichéd old Oliver Wendell Holmes opinions and waving his gavel around. But hey, I got the gig." Court watchers expect the Scalia video will prove far more popular than the release last summer of Associate Justice Clarence Thomas' audition tape, in which the then-42-year-old judge spent a full half hour staring into the camera in complete silence.

Chicago Introduces New Citywide Gun-Sharing Stations
CHICAGO — Touting the program's convenience and affordability, Chicago officials unveiled Monday the city's new gun-sharing service, "QuikShot," which allows individuals to check out a loaded firearm for short periods of time. The municipal initiative, through which users can rent semiautomatic pistols, shotguns, rifles, and submachine guns at more than 250 self-service kiosks, has reportedly been designed to make firepower easily available to residents and tourists alike nearly everywhere within the city limits. "QuikShot lets anyone with a credit card walk up to one of our street-side firearm stations, select a gun, and head out into the Windy City fully armed in just a few seconds," program director Arvind Reynolds told reporters, noting that borrowers can either rent their weapon for increments of 30 minutes or withdraw it for a full 24 hours if they plan on using it throughout the day. "With QuikShot, you and your friends can each take a Beretta up to Wrigley Field, or you can head to an outdoor concert in Millennium Park with a concealed 9mm revolver, or you can simply take in the great view of the Magnificent Mile from the roof deck of the Hancock tower through a scoped sniper rifle. The possibilities are truly endless with QuikShot." "And if the guns at one station are all checked out, users only have to walk a block or two to the next one in order to find a loaded firearm," he added. "So whether you've been planning an outing for a while or simply decided to head out in the spur of the moment, QuikShot has you covered." According to sources, after paying a small registration fee, QuikShot users may rent a firearm as often as they wish in neighborhoods ranging from Edgewater in the north, to the downtown Loop business district, to Hyde Park on the South Side, allowing them to brandish and discharge one or more rounds wherever they choose to in the city. Additionally, due to higher demand, Chicago officials said that multiple QuikShot kiosks would be opened around highly trafficked destinations, such as Navy Pier, the Art Institute, the Water Tower Place shopping center, and the Chicago Lakefront running and cycling paths. Because the firearms are expected to see heavy use, Reynolds confirmed that repair crews would regularly monitor the city's reholstering docks in order to clean and reload the weapons, as well as to replace guns that have jammed or misfired during operation, ensuring that borrowers aren't inconvenienced by their gun malfunctioning at a crucial moment. "It's a great addition to the city — nothing beats being able to run out of my apartment and have a gun in my hands whenever I want." Users, however, are reportedly expected to provide their own protective Kevlar body armor, with program administrators adding that the city of Chicago is not liable for any injuries incurred due to use of its rentals. "It's a great addition to the city — nothing beats being able to run out of my apartment and have a gun in my hands whenever I want," said Lincoln Park resident Keith Madsen, 32, noting that a QuikShot membership is much more economical than purchasing and maintaining his own extended magazine AR-15 assault rifle. "Even if I'm not necessarily planning on firing a gun on any given day, it's always nice to know that I have the option if something comes up." Sources confirmed that the city is planning to expand the service in the months ahead by purchasing more guns, with the goal of increasing its publicly available arsenal to more than 65,000 weapons in anticipation of the hot summer months, when QuikShot usage is expected to reach its peak. "QuikShot is so easy that I'm actually shooting a handgun way more often than I normally would," said local resident Danny Taylor, who participated in a pilot trial of the program, as he deposited an empty .357 Magnum with the QuikShot logo imprinted on its grip at a Rogers Park reholstering station. "Whether I'm going to a house party or just to the liquor store, it's nice to know that I can grab a piece, use it for as long as I want, and then drop it off without a lot of fuss." "In fact, I'm thinking about checking out one tomorrow morning before I head into the office," he continued.

Shitty Zoo Promoting Hell Out Of New Fruit Bat
WICHITA, KS — Desperately hoping to raise its profile and boost attendance, the Wichita Zoo, long considered one of the crappiest zoos in the United States, is using every resource at its disposal to promote the hell out of a new fruit bat, sources reported Friday. Local residents confirmed the zoo was "doing a real big push for that bat," who was christened Dwayne following a statewide naming contest and has since become a ubiquitous presence on the backs of benches and sides of buses throughout the greater Wichita area. "We've all got Dwayne fever around here," said zoo director David Tucker, sporting a Dwayne the Fruit Bat mesh trucker cap. "Why wouldn't we? Dwayne is an amazing fruit-bat specimen, and we've built a state-of-the-art habitat for him. His family comes from Australia, he has a wingspan of 15 inches — plus, he's one of only 40 fruit bats in the state. "We're really pulling out all the stops for this guy," Tucker added. Plagued by struggles over the years to attain adequate funding, the zoo has reportedly sunk everything it can into publicizing the fruit bat, renting out billboards along major highways in Wichita and covering them with a close-up photo of Dwayne accompanied by the slogan "Get Batty Wit It." Dwayne, a common tube-nosed fruit bat, or Nyctimene albiventer, has even taken a star turn on a morning radio show. "We thought it would be great to have the guys from the V-100 Zoo Crew come out here — to a real zoo — and do a broadcast," Tucker said. "We had a skit where they interviewed Dwayne, only he sounds like Bela Lugosi doing Dracula, and he says, 'I vant to dreenk your juice!' Since that's what fruit bats drink. I did the voice myself. It's pretty comical. "We're hoping everyone will bring their family to the zoo and get batty wit it as well," Tucker added. "You can watch Dwayne for hours. He won't mind! He's as friendly as a fruit bat can be. And don't be afraid. He doesn't bite…unless you're a peach or a mango! Tucker also showed reporters the 6-by-6-by-8-foot glass terrarium where Dwayne, on temporary loan from the San Diego Zoo, keeps company with a simulated bat colony, which zoo workers created by suspending 15 black socks from the ceiling and knotting each one at the end to create the appearance of a head. According to city officials, the fruit bat is the zoo's latest attempt to attract new patrons, shore up its finances, and avoid losing accreditation. While there was some success with 2009's Touch a Monkey campaign and last year's Bring Your Own Food for the Animals Week, attendance has steadily declined, and little at the zoo has generated much public interest since a family of raccoons took up residence in its abandoned polar bear enclosure five years ago. "I'm not really that into bats, but Dwayne was pretty cool," said fifth-grader Melinda Kepler, adding that the bat was somewhat smaller than she had expected him to be. "He didn't really move around that much. I guess you have to come at night for that. Though it closes at 5 p.m. daily, the zoo convinced a local electronics retailer to donate an old webcam that it keeps trained on the bat around the clock, allowing potential visitors to go online and view an image of Dwayne that refreshes every 30 seconds. "Who knows how long we're going to have this bat for? " said Tucker, who this month was forced to divert funds budgeted for repairing the zoo's mini-train ride in order to make payroll for his staff. "A month? Two months? All I know for sure is that Dwayne rocks, and you'd have to be 'blind as a bat' not to see that for yourself. At press time, zoo employees confirmed Dwayne the Fruit Bat had died from a combination of dehydration and muscle atrophy.

Jerry Sandusky Pretty Charming In Interview
NEW YORK — In a recent interview aired on The Today Show, serial child molester Jerry Sandusky came across as a likable and really quite charming individual, sources told reporters Tuesday. "Boy, I gotta say, I found myself liking him a lot in that interview," local man Scott Russell said of the former Penn State football coach and incarcerated rapist who last year was convicted of engaging in forced sodomy and oral sex with at least 10 underage boys. "He flashed that big ol' smile, and talked in this warm, soft-spoken voice, and you could tell he's got this really infectious, fun-loving personality. He was like a big kid! I don't know, I just liked the way he carried himself." Sources went on to confirm that "the guy's just got a nice vibe about him."

Chick-Fil-A Debuts New Homophobic Sandwich
'Queer-Hatin' Cordon Bleu' Goes On Sale Wednesday ATLANTA — As part of its recent efforts to publicly align itself with fundamentalist Christian values, the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain announced today the debut of its new Queer-Hatin' Cordon Bleu sandwich that would be on sale in all of the company's 1,600 restaurants this Wednesday. In a press conference to reporters, company representatives said the homophobic new sandwich will include the national fast food chain's trademark fried chicken filet wrapped in a piece of specially-smoked No Homo ham that would be topped with a slice of Swiss cheese and lathered in a creamy new Thousand Island-based Fag Punching sauce. "The Queer-Hatin' Cordon Bleu is our company's way of showing our firm commitment to strong, Christian family values," said Chick-fil-A spokesman Robert Gary, before adding that the vehemently anti-gay rights sandwich comes served in a combo with waffle fries and a medium soda for just $6.95. "From the very first morsel of this savory meal to the very last bite, customers can envision gays burning in hell with their sodomizing cohorts, and know that our sandwich is on their side." "Of course, the young ones will want to finish their meals off right with a No Fudge Packin' Soft Serve Cone," Gary added. "I can't think of a better way to follow up a sandwich this good. While the release of the Queer-Hatin' Cordon Bleu has led to anger from pro-gay rights groups, loyal Chick-fil-A customers claim they are happy they can finally enjoy a sandwich that takes a firm stance on the issue of homosexuality. "Any sandwich that combines that great Chick-fil-A flavor with a hefty dose of vitriolic homophobia is definitely going to keep me coming back for more," said Atlanta customer John Oaks. "Come Wednesday, I'm going to be first in line for this thing." According to sources, the Queer-Hatin' Cordon Bleu is merely the first of Chick-fil-A's new family values menu which is set to include the AIDS Is God's Curse chicken nugget combo and the Fags Caused 9/11 strawberry fruit smoothie.

Visa Exposed As Massive Credit Card Scam
SAN FRANCISCO — In coordinated raids Monday at locations in Delaware, South Dakota, and California, federal agents apprehended dozens of executives at Visa Inc., a sham corporation accused of perpetrating the largest credit card scam in U.S. history. According to indictments filed in U.S. District Court, Visa posed as a reputable lender, working through banks to peddle a variety of convincing-looking credit cards carefully designed to dupe consumers into spending far more money than they had. The criminal group would then impose a succession of escalating fees on unpaid balances, allegedly bilking some $300 billion from victims in the past year alone. "This is criminal behavior of the most vile sort," Attorney General Eric Holder said in a press conference following the arrests, estimating that one in three Americans have fallen for the scam since its inception in the 1970s. "By masquerading as a legitimate business, this illicit syndicate was able to prey on helpless citizens for decades, charging unfathomable interest rates on the order of 15, 20, even 30 percent or more. It's staggering. Nobody could afford that. "The actions of the Visa crime ring amount to nothing less than mass extortion," Holder continued. "Anyone who's holding a Visa card has most likely already been ripped off. Calling the scam's breadth and sophistication "unparalleled," Holder said the ringleaders of the plot carefully portrayed themselves as top-level financial executives, spent untold sums of victims' money on a luxurious high-rise headquarters in San Francisco, and employed scores of graduates from elite business schools — all as a means to perpetuate an elaborate confidence game. Investigators said Visa often targeted vulnerable individuals, such as those with limited financial resources, students, and even the elderly. The group's typical con involved direct solicitation through letters supposedly written by the CEO himself, which often praised the recipients by name and stated that they had been hand-selected for favored treatment. "I needed to pay off some medical bills, and this seemed like a good option," said Visa cardholder Eileen Carlson of Phoenix, explaining that her initial skepticism of the offers was worn down by the barrage of official-looking mail she received almost daily from the criminal organization. "But before I knew it, they were demanding at least $900 a month, which I couldn't pay. They knew I didn't have any money to begin with — what did they expect? "And they kept after me for years," added Carlson, breaking into tears. "For christsakes, you can't get blood from a stone. According to the Federal Trade Commission, Visa often employed perverse twists on its standard ruse, luring victims with promises of free gifts, enticing but inscrutable "rewards" programs, or deceptively low interest rates that later ballooned out of control and siphoned away every last penny a person had. "These crooks manipulated interest rates and charged arbitrary, exorbitant fees on literally anything they could — too much credit card activity, too little activity — it was utterly shameless," said Barbara Pendleton of the FTC, suggesting Visa used deliberately confusing financial language as well as fraudulent threats of litigation to squeeze money from its victims. "Then they sat back and did nothing while the money flowed in from people who actually work for a living. Added Pendleton: "What's more — and this is truly sickening — they became so confident they could get away with this stuff that they openly conducted national ad campaigns and sponsored charity events. These people are the scum of the earth. According to former Visa CFO R. Neil Williams, a crime boss turned government informant, the syndicate compiled troves of sensitive personal data on millions of Americans, including home addresses, birth dates, and income levels, and regularly sold this information to third parties or exploited it to draw new victims into the scam. "Sure, people should have known better than to trust a magical card that allowed them to buy anything they want without any money whatsoever," Williams said. "But at Visa we understood that people will believe anything if they want it bad enough. That was the genius of our whole scheme. As of press time, lawyers for Visa had proclaimed their clients' innocence, citing the fact that there is still no federal law stopping banks from charging any interest rate they goddamn please.

MLB Bans Cruel Practice Of Castrating Mascots
NEW YORK — Saying that the "antiquated and barbaric procedure" has no place in modern baseball, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred announced Monday that the league was banning the brutal practice of castrating mascots. "Despite being a long accepted practice among team owners, the MLB executive board has determined that it is unethical and dangerous to perform the invasive act of removing a mascot's genitals," said Manfred, responding to public outcry over what many consider to be a cruel surgery, which teams claim makes mascots docile, easy to train, and prevents them from attacking fans. "Mascots are subjected to this gelding as early as their first season with a team, and sadly the procedure is often done without the use of anesthetics. While we need to ensure that mascots can live in close proximity to humans, we believe alternatives like hormone treatments can achieve the same result without resorting to the brutal mutilation of a mascot's sexual organs." Manfred expressed hope that the ban would eliminate the last link between the MLB and the horrific early 20th-century practice of using sterilization to remove "inferior" mascots from the gene pool.

Police Find Adorable Little Skeleton
MIDLAND, MI — While exercising a search warrant at a Morgan Road residence Tuesday, officers from the Midland Police Department reported finding an "absolutely adorable" set of skeletonized human remains. "When we pulled that plastic shopping bag from underneath the shed, we had no idea what a cute little surprise was in store for us," said Deputy Jim Olszanski, who noted this was the fourth and by far the tiniest of the miniature skeletons police had recovered from the property over the past week. "Looking into those big eye sockets in its itty-bitty skull or at those teensy hand and feet bones — it melts your heart. " Police at the scene said they hoped eventually to find another small skeleton whose spine hadn't been pulverized from apparent blunt-force trauma.

Fuck Everything, Nation Reports
Just Fuck It All To Hell WASHINGTON — Following the fatal shooting this morning at a Connecticut elementary school that left at least 27 dead, including 20 small children, sources across the nation shook their heads, stifled a sob in their voices, and reported fuck everything. Just fuck it all to hell. All of it, sources added. "I'm sorry, but fuck it, I can't handle this — I just can't handle it anymore," said Deborah McEllis, who added that "no, no, no, no, no, this isn't happening, this can't be real." "Seriously, what the hell is this? What's even going on anymore? Why do things like this keep happening?" Continued McEllis, before covering her face with her hands, "Why?" Despairing sources confirmed that the gunman, armed with a semiautomatic assault rifle — a fucking combat rifle, Jesus — walked into a classroom full of goddamned children where his mother was a teacher and, good God, if this is what the world is becoming, then how about we just pack it in and fucking give up, because this is no way to live. I mean, honestly, all 315 million Americans confirmed. "Well, I suppose we have to try to pick up the pieces and make some sort of sense of this tragedy and — you know what? Fuck it, I can't do this," said Connecticut resident Michael Zaleski, his remarks understandable given the circumstances, because, holy shit, what else can one say? "I'm sorry, but I can't fucking do this. Can you? Can anyone?" Witnesses said the gunman fired at least 100 rounds during his deadly rampage, which, according to children in the school — goddamnit, how? How? Twenty children. Dead. In a fucking school. No. No, no, no. "I just feel so [why does it even matter what this person said when no words can bring 20 dead kids back to life? ]" said some person who, just like everyone else, is completely unable to process or handle any of this. "It's awful. Just too awful to bear." Americans reported feelings of overwhelming disgust with whatever abhorrent bastard did this and with the world at large for ever allowing it to happen, as well as with politicians, with the NRA, and above all with their own pathetic goddamn selves, sitting in front of a fucking computer instead of doing fucking anything to help anyone — Christ, as if that were even fucking possible, as if anyone could change what happened, as if the same fucking bullshit isn't going to keep happening again and again and fucking again before people finally decide it's time to change the way we live, so what's the point? What the hell is the goddamned point? "I…" said Tom Miller, 27, after reading an article about the tragedy online. "I just…" "…" he added. At press time…screw it, there's nothing else to say.

"I said quit it! Emily, do you want a spanking, too?" At press time, every single man and woman at Sears was tugging a child by the arm toward the exit and promising they'd be sorry when they got home.

Girlfriend Overdoses On Lotion
PURCHASE, NY — Area girlfriend Caroline Nagler remains in stable condition at White Plains Hospital today, resting in a medically induced coma after suffering an apparent overdose of scented lotion, sources confirm. Responding to a frantic 911 call from her boyfriend, emergency personnel said they rushed to Nagler's residence around 10 p.m. last night and discovered the 26-year-old unconscious in her bed and surrounded by dozens of empty bottles of daily moisturizers, anti-wrinkle treatments, and hydrating balms, suggesting an acute level of lotion toxicity. "When we arrived, Ms. Nagler's blood-lotion level was 0.45. That's four times the lethal limit," said emergency responder Anne Jones, noting that in addition to finding high levels of Olay and Jergens in her system, doctors also discovered traces of harder oils like ylang-ylang and jojoba. "Her lips were extremely glossy — glossier than I've ever seen. It took us hours to stabilize her shea-soaked skin before we could even begin wiping off the many herbal extracts and replenishing creams, not to mention bath and shower gels. "We're guessing that by the time her boyfriend found her, she had been inhaling cocoa butter and eucalyptus fumes for over 45 minutes," Jones continued. "One more Buf-Puf of jasmine serum and it would have been too late." Doctors said that after Nagler arrived at the hospital's trauma ward, it was a "race against time" to save the young woman's life, with teams of nurses working around the clock to neutralize the accumulated layers of almond butters, Moroccan oils, essential fruit extracts, and age-defying exfoliants that had left her skin dangerously supple. After first treating her arms and legs to remove the thick coat of honeysuckle and whipped vanilla gloss, emergency room staff vigorously scrubbed Nagler's body with gauze to reduce the buildup of vitamin E and hibiscus. Next, the medical team used a high-powered pump to suction the ultra-hydrating lotions from her face and hands, areas that had been exposed to critical periods of long-lasting moisturization. According to friends, Nagler's overdose was the result of being a habitual lotion user whose addiction had, as of late, spiraled out of control. "Caroline didn't do this to herself on purpose — she just didn't know her limit," distraught boyfriend Eric Klein told investigators, recalling that Nagler would often come home covered in a layer of lavender salve without acknowledging that she glistened brightly or smelled heavily of morning dew. "It's a wonder she hasn't had an overdose yet; it's a full-on addiction. She hides the bottles everywhere — underneath the sink, in the back of cabinets. I once saw her pull a small bottle of it out of her purse. She couldn't go 20 minutes without it." "It was only a matter of time before she started mixing lotions," Klein continued. "Every morning it was a cocktail of prescription-strength aloe-vera, rosewater, sunscreen, Wrinkle Revenge cream, and who knows what else." Emergency room doctors say that as lotions become more fragrant, more flirty, and more expensive, hospitals will continue to see cases of women overdosing from the products. In the past week alone, local hospitals treated more than 20 local girlfriends with injuries similar to Nagler's, according to records. "The mistake so many women make is thinking they can slather on a layer of cedarwood foam, wait a few minutes, and then start rubbing on some shiny body butter," said emergency physician Dr. Thomas Nguyen, noting that his own girlfriend had a close call last week when she applied more than 80 doses of Jurlique balancing spray, or "pillow mist" as it's known in street slang. "The rule of thumb is to use a quarter-sized dollop of lotion, wait an hour, then use more if necessary. Oiling up too quickly vastly increases the risk of internal organ failure, or worse." "If you think you have a problem, please seek help immediately," he continued. "Your life is worth more than having silky-smooth skin, no matter how soft and luxurious it might feel."

USDA Just Doing Quick Smell Tests To Inspect All The Backlogged Meat That Piled Up During Shutdown
WASHINGTON — With the federal government back open this week, food safety officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Monday that they had begun a round of quick smell tests in order to inspect the sizeable backlog of meat that had piled up over the course of 35 days. "The shutdown put us really far behind on inspections, so this seems like the best bet to get us back on track," Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told reporters as he worked his way through the stacks of meat in his office, noting that over the past month, approximately 4 million tons of meat had accumulated in his department's facilities awaiting the okay from furloughed inspectors. "Right now, our priority is giving all this meat a good sniff and getting it out to the American people as fast as we can. Most of it seems all right. Some of the stuff is close to turning but could still be used for stew. We've got a lot to get through, so as long as there isn't a visible film on it or anything, we'll probably just stamp it Grade A and put it on the shelves." Perdue went on to add that when workers were done playing catch-up with the meat, they would move on to the estimated 600 million gallons of milk currently sitting in the USDA headquarters basement. UPDATE: Sonny Perdue violently shitting self after contracting food poisoning from spoiled meat.

New Decoy Website Launched To Lure Away All Moronic Internet Commenters
SAN JOSE, CA — With funding from dozens of news outlets and media companies, the groundbreaking Outkube.com launched this week, providing an online destination where pandering and incendiary content is used to lure moronic Internet commenters away from all other websites. According to sources, Outkube boasts thousands of articles and forums carefully crafted to draw in dim-witted web users and effectively quarantine obtuse, uninformed comments on topics such as gay rights, Ryan Gosling, the threat of Sharia law in the U.S., health care reform, whether Kobe is better than LeBron, Jewish control of the government and media, the New York Jets, the Second Amendment, and professional wrestler John Cena. Most stories on the site are reportedly preloaded with several witless and profanity-laden comments specially designed to incite retaliatory remarks. "Outkube provides an immensely valuable public service," said YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar, one of the decoy website's founders and principal investors. "With its unparalleled expanse of sensational content and lack of filters or character limits on postings, Outkube attracts the broadest possible spectrum of jabbering halfwits — from paranoid reactionaries to know-it-all pricks to racists to plain old dumbfucks. "Now you can read an article or enjoy multimedia on your favorite websites without having to endure the revolting, barely coherent comments these troglodytes used to leave at the bottom of every page," Kamangar continued. "At long last, a new era has dawned for the Internet." Officials at Outkube explained the site relies on a set of fine-tuned algorithms to produce and continuously refresh its content. Using up-to-the-minute sports scores, trending search terms, TV viewing statistics, and key phrases from the latest scaremongering political e-mail forwards, the formulas churn out the divisive social commentary and mindless celebrity gossip upon which web-surfing morons thrive. In addition, sources confirmed that each day Outkube's software produces dozens of new pop-culture rankings, such as "The 10 Most Underrated Bands" or "The 15 Best Sci-Fi Movies Of All Time," which have been shown to occupy some of the Internet's most obnoxious commenters indefinitely, freeing the remainder of the web for actual rational discourse. The new site also caters to its target demographic with a corps of full-time bloggers including Geraldo Rivera, Rosie O'Donnell, and Spencer Pratt. "This is a godsend," said Kenneth Estenson of CNN, which owns a major stake in Outkube. "We've seen a huge drop in the number of CNN.com commenters accusing one another of being fucking retard dipshits, and the once common practice among users of equating any viewpoint they do not personally share to the philosophy of the Taliban has almost entirely disappeared. Added Estenson: "It's astonishing. A group of our site's users actually had an intelligent discussion yesterday about the justice system in the Amanda Knox case without being consistently interrupted by speculation about Ms. Knox's tits or her quote-unquote 'taco.' I never could have dreamed this day would come. Although Outkube sources admitted the site required little oversight — with nearly all posts devolving on their own into heated exchanges over the Koran's alleged endorsement of wife-beating, whether Adam Lambert should get AIDS and die, or the government's secret plan to mentally incapacitate citizens using the HPV vaccine — the site does employ moderators to ensure threads stay as active and idiotic as possible. "Internet commenters are so inherently dim that, by simply responding to their ridiculous rants with an equally inflammatory statement — for example, by accusing them of engaging in homosexual acts or belittling their favored sports star or political candidate — these imbeciles can't help but react with outrage and continue to engage with our site," Outkube webmaster Sean Hawk said. "They take the bait every time. "Christ, they're stupid," he added. Hawk then demonstrated a feature that detects when a user has been idle for more than 15 seconds and automatically triggers a pop-up window containing a photograph of a woman whom the user is asked to rate on a scale of "fugly cunt" to "totally boneable," a tactic that prevents 9 of 10 idiots from leaving the website, according to internal statistics. Though the site has won praise for providing a much-need service and has already attracted more than 40 million registered users, Outkube has also earned its share of detractors. "This site sux serios dick," wrote a user known as "19brazzballz86," who left one of the more than 100,000 negative responses posted so far on Outkube's feedback page. "Fuk u!!! hahah a GO GATORS!!!!"

Saudi Women Receive Husbands' Explicit Permission To Celebrate Right To Vote
RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA — In the wake of the watershed decision granting them the right to vote in the 2015 elections, Saudi women have received their husbands' explicit consent to rejoice, sources reported Wednesday. "It is with great pride that women all across Saudi Arabia have been allowed to leave their homes under the guardianship of a male relative and celebrate this cultural landmark," father of four Khalid al-Kazaz told reporters. "It brings us great pleasure to permit them a few moments in which to smile beneath their hijabs before returning to their daily duties. " Saudi officials followed the announcement with another historic decree that lowered from 10 to 7 the number of lashes that will be administered to women who drive themselves to the voting booth.

Warriors Attribute Finals Loss To Durant's Ruptured Achilles, Klay's Torn ACL, Curry Being Hit By Bus Near End Of Game 6
OAKLAND, CA — Reviewing the circumstances that led to their defeat by the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Finals, the Golden State Warriors attributed their series loss to forward Kevin Durant rupturing his Achilles, guard Klay Thompson tearing his ACL, and guard Steph Curry being hit by a bus near the end of game six. "No disrespect to Toronto, because they played a great series, but we can't help thinking that [Kevon] Looney's lingering chest injury, Draymond [Green] falling into that woodchipper early in game five, and Shaun [Livingston] getting harpooned and rupturing most of his internal organs played a role in our defeat," said head coach Steve Kerr, adding that it was hard to keep the momentum going after a combine harvester ran over the entire bench in game five. "We don't want to use our injuries as an excuse, but we just want to acknowledge that it's really hard to craft strong lineups when you're dealing with DeMarcus Cousins limping around after multiple on-court knife wounds, or when you lose a guy like [Andre] Iguadola, who was hobbled from the Oracle's ceiling collapsing and crushing his legs. Plus, that bus ran over Curry so many times — tough when you lose your best shooter because all his fingers have been ripped off. It's too bad we didn't get to see what the Finals would've looked like without all our starters contracting hemlock poisoning and Andrew Bogut getting struck by lightning on three separate occasions." Reporters' final questions about the Warriors' future were handled by assistant coach Mike Brown after Kerr fell into an open manhole in the Oracle Arena press room and owner Joe Lacob spontaneously combusted.

Cackling Mitch McConnell Reveals To Stunned Democrats He's Been Working Undercover For Republican Party This Whole Time
WASHINGTON — Divulging the long-running scheme to his visibly stunned congressional colleagues Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, a cackling Mitch McConnell reportedly shocked Democrats Wednesday with the revelation he has been secretly working for the Republican Party all along. "You fools! For years, I've pulled the wool over your eyes, but at last, I unveil my ruse!" cried the Kentucky senator, who confessed his true identity as a top elected official within the GOP, causing a wide-eyed Schumer and Pelosi to clutch their heads and emit exclamations of "No, it can't be!" and "I trusted you!" "All along, I've been working to thwart your every step, and you fell for it. I thought for sure you would catch on when I told you my decision to block Merrick Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court was strictly a matter of preserving Senate decorum, but nope, not even then. What buffoons you are! What oafs! Muahahaha!" At press time, sources reported Schumer was just glad his own cover hadn't been blown.

Chinese Officials Respond To NBA Controversy By Moving Millions Of Citizens To NHL Re-Fanification Camps
BEIJING — On the heels of recent pro-Hong Kong comments by Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey, Chinese officials responded to the criticism Tuesday by moving millions of Chinese citizens to NHL re-fanification camps. "To show that China will not tolerate this flagrant disrespect for our nation amongst the ranks of the NBA, we intend to enlighten our citizens in the ways of the National Hockey League," said Vice Premier Han Zheng, overseeing the first of many re-fanification ceremonies in a detention center outside of Beijing where citizens were encouraged at gunpoint to throw NBA merchandise into bonfires and subsequently issued compulsory Sidney Crosby jerseys, posters of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and Blu-ray copies of The Cutting Edge. "With this action, we will undo the harmful legacy of basketball on our nation's psyche, using unyielding exposure to the ways in which hockey aligns with the values of China, a dynasty not unlike that of the Boston Bruins. By the time our citizens board their trains back home, they will not remember that such a thing as the NBA ever existed. All they will know is the joy of a slapshot, the grace of a goalie, and the unlimited potential of the St. Louis Blues in the postseason." At press time, sources confirmed that officials were forcing unpaid re-fanification camp labor to construct hockey arenas nationwide.

Deformed, Half-Feathered Audubon Society President Flees Into Forest After Injecting Self With Bird DNA
NEW YORK — Breaking into a grotesque, flapping half-run as his knees reversed themselves and pinion feathers burst wetly from his elongating fingers, rapidly deforming National Audubon Society president David Yarnold leapt through a window of his Manhattan office and flew in a series of ungainly swooping lurches towards the forests of upstate New York Friday after injecting himself with the DNA of a red-tailed hawk. "Look away! Look away, damn you," the nonprofit CEO and feather-covered monstrosity hissed in a quasi-avian squawk as he disappeared into a thicket. "Oh, God! What have I become? I'm no bird — I'm no man — I'm a monster!" In possibly related news, several rural Hudson Valley communities reported that a large birdlike abomination bearing a resemblance to Yarnold had injured itself while attacking its own horrific reflection in plate-glass windows.

It Would Really Help Me Out If You Guys Could Just Give Up Your Health Insurance This One Time
Hey there, it's your ol' pal, Mitch. How've you been? Great, great. Anyways, I got a small favor to ask. You see, I've got this problem that's been bothering me for a while and I was kind of hoping you could give me a hand with it. Basically, it would really, really help me out right now if you could just give up your health insurance this one time. I know, I know, you've got other things to deal with right now. I get it. But I'm kind of in a pinch at the moment and if you just want to go ahead and get rid of your health coverage, as well as any coverage for your spouse and children, I'd greatly appreciate it. Seriously, it would mean so much to me if you did that. Honestly, it would be pretty quick and easy. All you have to do is take a minute or two and dump whatever insurance you've got: HMO, PPO, prescription drug coverage, opioid treatment, mental health services, hospice care, everything. Oh, and your maternity leave. I'm definitely gonna need that, too. If I'm being honest, the sooner you could eliminate those things, the better it would be for me. And let me make it clear: this is all I'm asking. You drop your access to affordable healthcare just this once and I swear I won't bother you again. That's it. Promise. C'mon. Believe me, I do not want to be inconveniencing you like this. You think I like coming here, hat in hand, urging you to cast aside your means of coping with medical expenses? I don't. Honestly, I feel like a fool having to ask you to give up the policies that provide with you cost-free preventative care and ensure your family doesn't succumb to financial ruin in the event of a health crisis, but truth be told, I'm in a tight spot here. A real tight spot. So what do you say? Could you find it in your heart to do this one little thing for ol' Mitchy Boy? Hey, you know I've been there for you in the past. Remember that infrastructure bill a couple years ago? Or what about those tax-cut extensions back in 2010? Those were pretty good times, right? So what do you say you just do me this solid and get rid of whatever policy you and your family have? Please? I'd owe you one. Still no? Oh, so you'd rather hold onto your precious insurance than help your friend Mitch out of a jam? Jesus Christ, what's with you? I ask you to do one little thing for me and this is what I get? Fine. Have it your way. You know what, keep your stupid health insurance — I'll just go and redirect an increasing share of your income to multinational corporations and the nation's wealthiest citizens and see how you like that! Fucking assholes. Mitch McConnell

Yosemite National Park Completes Construction On New 6-Lane Scenic Driving Trail
YOSEMITE VILLAGE, CA — Hailing it as an exciting new way to experience the park in all its glory, Yosemite National Park announced Friday that it had completed construction of a new six-lane scenic driving trail. "We're proud to announce the opening of our new six-lane Sierra Heritage Supertrail, which will traverse such amazing landmarks as Mariposa Grove, Glacier Point, and El Capitan, all in under 45 minutes," said Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman, adding that a rotary atop Half Dome will allow drivers to slow down to take pictures without the inconvenience of exiting their vehicles. "Visitors can roll down their windows and experience the fresh air from each of the park's five different vegetation zones as they cruise by majestic waterfalls and awe-inspiring valleys at 60 miles per hour. And keep an eye out for the diverse wildlife that lives within Yosemite, because the trail winds through all the major animal habitats." At press time, traffic had slowed to a crawl at Sentinel Rock as six lanes of vehicles merged to pass through the single manned toll booth.

Rust Belt Town Protests Construction Of New Truck Stop That Would Obstruct Views Of State Penitentiary
YOUNGSTOWN, OH — Collectively rising up against the threat to their rust belt community, the citizens of Youngstown, a former steel and foundry center, were protesting Tuesday the construction of a truck stop that would obstruct views of the nearby state penitentiary. "That penitentiary has been the symbolic heart of our community ever since it was built. They can't put up some fancy new truck stop right in front of it," said protester and longtime resident Neil Mauer regarding the proposal to construct a Love's Travel Stop & Country Store in a location that directly interferes with sightlines of the beloved prison for those living in the city's largest residential neighborhood. "That penitentiary is a part of us. The last thing we need is a bunch of out-of-town truck drivers hogging the remarkable views of our prison. We shouldn't have to drive half an hour to the park on McGuffey Road to see it just because some millionaire truck stop owner wanted the best location in town." At press time, protestors were dismayed to learn that Pilot Flying J had plans to build a truck stop that would totally block the view of the old brake pad factory.

SAN FRANCISCO — Placing the Facebook founder under arrest after he briefly attempted to flee, San Francisco police busted a filthy, unshaven Mark Zuckerberg in the early hours of the morning Tuesday for trying to sell his personal data on a street corner. "Here, if anyone wants my browsing data, my search history, my credit card number, anything — I'm selling it cheap.

Struggling Amtrak To Discontinue Mysterious Late-Night Trains To Spirit Realm
WASHINGTON — In response to a decline in revenue from routes running between the two disparate planes of existence, Amtrak announced Friday that it plans to cancel the mysterious, mist-enshrouded trains offering late-night service into the darkest realms of the spirit. The trains, which according to Amtrak timetables leave once daily at the stroke of midnight, their headlamps cutting through thick tendrils of billowing fog as they travel nonstop to points along their accursed route, will cease all operations September 1 as part of an effort to better allocate resources. "The cost-cutting measures we've introduced today include the termination of service to all stops between Amtrak terminals and the domain of shadows that drives men to complete and utter madness," CEO Charles Moorman told reporters during a press conference. "The fuel required for these long journeys to ominous and inexplicable destinations within the spirit realm greatly increases our operating costs, as does the need to staff each car with the ghosts of our passenger's deceased relatives." "Service will continue through the end of the month," he added. "At that point, any pained, restless mortals unable to find a moment of solace since the horrible accident on the eve of their wedding will have to make other travel arrangements." "The cost-cutting measures include the termination of service to all stops between Amtrak terminals and the domain of shadows that drives men to complete and utter madness." According to financial records, the Hereafter Regional Line, which originates in a faint hazy glow in the distance and makes stops along the void bridging the worlds of the living and the dead, has been operating at a loss since the early 2000s. Though its service has been curtailed over the years, the train's stops have been known to include a deserted station at which a faceless man in a frock coat waits to board, a perfectly still moonlit lake, a manor house in which the motionless silhouette of a young woman can be seen in the only lighted window, and a gaping chasm from which one can hear the tortured screams of the damned. Officials confirmed they had been unsuccessful with a recent fiscal plan to rein in expenses by running fewer trains during solstices and on the anniversary of the ill-fated night all those years ago when one's life went horribly, horribly wrong. Compounding the line's economic woes are its aging 19th-century locomotives, which reportedly require constant maintenance in order to continue barreling down the tracks at ever faster speeds while the banshee's screech of metal upon metal echoes the wails of the accursed souls onboard. Sources added that the track, portions of which curve around forgotten graveyards with half-uprooted tombstones or corkscrew straight up into the night sky, cannot easily be shared by other Amtrak lines, leaving the track largely unused and unprofitable during daylight hours. "These days, a lot fewer people are being drawn into an abandoned rail yard by the beguiling whisper of their lost loves only to find themselves emerging into a flickering phantasm of Grand Central Station in the 1940s," said Moorman, noting that Amtrak had struggled to shift from a rider base of spectral gangsters and Civil War soldiers reliving their final moments on earth to millennials. "Unfortunately, that means this service will no longer be available to customers on their way to meet the hollow-eyed ferryman who, if you cross his palm with silver, will take you on harrowing journeys that pierce the veil of death, but that's a reality we have to face." "Often there won't be a single person waiting on the platform when our conductors shamble off the train and hold their lanterns aloft in long, skeletal fingers," he continued. "So clearly our current approach isn't working." While Moorman acknowledged that canceling the routes would inconvenience many otherworld commuters, he said Amtrak planned to ease the transition by running a shuttle service to and from the land of everlasting torment through November. He went on to state that customers who had exchanged their most cherished memory for a ticket on the now-defunct line would receive full credit for their fond reminiscence and be allowed to apply it to the fare of any other Amtrak route.

Talkative Motherfucker Not So Extroverted Now That Friend Got Off Train
CHICAGO — Noting that the gregarious bastard got pretty shy real damn quick once his little playmate disappeared, public transit sources confirmed Monday that a certain talkative motherfucker isn't so extroverted now that his buddy has gotten off the train. "Well, well, well. Seems Mr. Conversation ain't such a silver-tongued devil without his usual audience," said the sources, who couldn't help but notice that the CTA Blue Line's resident Jay Gatsby seemed to have stopped holding court at the precise moment that his precious companion took his leave at the Division stop. "What's the matter, Chatty Cathy? Didn't you save a bon mot or two for the rest of the train? Just a moment ago, you were living it up while everybody else sat quietly, listening to podcasts. But guess what — now that your buddy left, you're just like the rest of us. Well? How's that feel, motherfucker?" Witnesses on the scene confirmed the suddenly timid commuter was observed slinking off the train at the next stop without so much as a wave goodbye.

MTA Unveils New Designated Seating For Commuters Who Look Like They're About To Snap
NEW YORK — In a move touted as a major victory for the rights of New Yorker public transportation passengers who are this close to fucking losing it, the Metropolitan Transit Authority unveiled a new designated seating system Friday designed to accommodate commuters who seem to be just about to snap. "For too many years, the New York City MTA has failed to meet the needs of scowling riders repeatedly muttering 'Fuck this shit' under their breath, but today, we're excited to announce that individuals about to blow a fuse will now be offered seats where they can have a second of goddamn peace," said spokesman Aaron Donovan, adding that the initiative would cater to the roughly 1.7 million city residents who find themselves on the brink of daily violent meltdowns by adding a minimum of four seating options by the entrance of each subway car, rail car, and bus. "Those seats reserved for customers one bad moment away from flipping their wig at any second will have signage indicating them as such. Those who are clearly going through some serious shit and wearing an expression conveying 'Not today' have long been overlooked, so, as always, offer your seat to the critically cranked-up when at all possible." Shortly after their introduction, thousands of transit passengers across New York City were seen going totally fucking apeshit upon discovering the priority seats already occupied.

MTA Urges Riders To Stop Taking Disabled Passengers
NEW YORK — In a sternly worded reminder of baseline subway etiquette, the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority released a statement Wednesday instructing riders not to take disabled passengers for their personal use. "Transit personnel have seen a significant increase in train, bus, and ferry passengers taking handicapped passengers," read the statement, which reminded MTA customers of the $200 fine incurred by riders abusing standard MTA passenger guidelines by picking up handicapped people and taking them back to their homes. "We realize that when stressed or rushed, you may absentmindedly grab a handicapped passenger — we've done it ourselves — but enough is enough. It's extremely disrespectful, even dangerous, to take a disabled person from a train, bus, or park-and-ride lot. For their safety and yours, be aware of your surroundings. And please, understand that the handicapped are not yours to take." The statement also clarified that fines apply to riders who take an elderly or pregnant passenger.

Guy On Bus Really Good At Whatever Phone Game That Is
Gamers, get ready because we have the performance of a lifetime to show you! This guy riding on a bus is absolutely crushing it at whatever phone game he's playing. The roughly 30-year-old man has achieved total-gaming-legend status as he swipes his fingers with mind-boggling skill over the screen, completely annihilating at what appears to be some sort of puzzle game based around taking different sushi ingredients and grouping them together based on patterns. In fact, this video game god is operating at such an epic skill level that he doesn't even hesitate when the bus hits a pothole or after getting jostled by a woman pushing past him for the exit. While other passengers are reading books or texting friends after a long day at work, this bus-riding titan is seemingly racking up hundreds of thousands of sashimi points or whatever they happen to be called in this game. And while we don't know how the levels work or whether he is trying to build sushi rolls or eat them or whatever, it's clear that this beast is slicing the rolls at a truly furious pace! Whoa! The screen just went all crazy and all the sushi vanished in a burst of light, but this guy isn't even breaking a sweat. He's clearly in a challenge stage or bonus round or something. Goddamn, this is truly a feat to be remembered! Well, it looks like the guy just quickly exited out of the sushi game and got off the bus, but gamers should definitely stay on the lookout for this all-time champion the next time they take the 87 Westbound!

Zion Williamson Excited To Play For Team With Proven History Of Frittering Away Generational Talents
NEW ORLEANS — Claiming it would be an honor to follow in the footsteps of players like Chris Paul and Anthony Davis, Zion Williamson told reporters Tuesday that he's excited to play for a team with a proven history of frittering away generational talents. "It will honestly be surreal to step on a court where such great players have been wasted year after year. Nobody is better than New Orleans at throwing away a promising career, and now, it's my turn," said Williamson, noting that the Smoothie King Center was hallowed ground that has been the graveyard of so many all-time greats' dreams. "I just know the Pelicans will be able to surround me with sub-par, mismatched teammates and a coaching staff that'll definitely get fired within the next few years. It's tough to deal with the uncertainty of the draft, so knowing I'm going to end up with such a consistently disappointing franchise is great. I know they will do everything they can to make me regret ever declaring early." At press time, Williamson told reporters that he expected to set the franchise record for trade requests.

Zion Williamson In Panic After Realizing Game Falls On Same Night As Theater Club Production
COLUMBIA, SC — Frantically pacing and weighing the fallout of skipping the game, Duke forward Zion Williamson was panicking Friday after realizing his NCAA tournament game against North Dakota State falls on the same night as his theater club's production of In The Heights. "Oh man, oh man, I can't believe this is happening. I don't wanna miss the game, but that club is my passion, and I made a promise to this cast," said Williamson, revealing that Duke's "amazing theater club" was perhaps the deciding factor that drove him to enroll at the university. "I know RJ [Barrett] and Tre [Jones] will be upset if I skip out, but that club is like my family — they were the first friends I made on campus. We've been rehearsing this for months now; I know all my lines and I just got all my blocking down. And the show will be a total train wreck without me. Cory is my understudy for a reason — there's absolutely no way he can handle the role of Graffiti Pete." At press time, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was telling Williamson to forget about what everyone else wanted and follow his heart.

Watching The Olympics Has Inspired Me To Start Trying To Jump Over Stuff
The Olympics never fail to leave me in awe. It is both humbling and enthralling to witness what the greatest athletes in the world can accomplish when they work hard and push themselves to excel. And this time around, watching the incredible achievements at the winter games in Pyeongchang has motivated me to strive for such excellence myself. Inspired by the Olympics, I've spent the past two weeks trying to jump over all kinds of stuff. I started with really small things, like a stack of books and the ottoman in my living room. That may not seem like much, but I have big dreams and you have to start somewhere. Besides, I'm pretty sure gold medalist Vincent Zhou didn't land a quadruple spin thing the first time he put on skates. He started out doing easier jumps and worked up to the way harder ones, probably taking quite a few tumbles along the way. It's a grueling process, but I've learned that sometimes you just have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and detangle your foot from the lawn chair you just failed to clear. Becoming a champion who can soar over a bunch of different junk takes true devotion and a willingness to sacrifice all your personal relationships. Plus, you have to stick to a strict dietary regimen — mine's mostly beef jerky and pepperoni sticks — as well as a relentless practice schedule. I train for hours with stuff around the house and in my backyard, trying to jump higher, trying to jump forward, trying to jump backward. Sure, there are times I'd rather be hanging out with friends or watching TV, but instead I'm trying one more time to hop that picket fence. It's hard to believe, but barely a day goes by anymore when I'm not out there seeing if I can jump over something. I've experienced my fair share of struggles along the way. There are times I've tripped. There are times I've banged my knees up pretty bad. There was even one time when I totally ate it trying to jump over my car and wound up in an urgent-care clinic. I thought for sure my career was over, but then I had a realization: If Olympians like Lindsey Vonn and Shaun White could come back from devastating injuries to win medals in Pyeongchang, who was I to throw in the towel? It wasn't long before I was back at it, jumping over stuff at the children's playground near my home. What it really comes down to is passion. One of my goals is to make it to Tokyo in 2020 so I can be there during the opening ceremonies to jump the Olympic torch, and I don't intend to let anything stand in my way. Luckily, the rush of adrenaline I get with each leap allows me to tune out the ache in my quadriceps, the family members who try to guilt me into quitting, and the security guard who tells me I'm not allowed to jump over benches and potted plants at my local shopping center. That man can throw me out of the mall for misjudging the height of the Boost Mobile kiosk, slamming into it, and causing smartphone accessories to fly in every direction, but he can't take away my dreams of glory. I know I may fail. I may never jump up an entire staircase or vault over a school bus. And it's possible I won't match the feats of my heroes, pulling off back-to-back 1080s over my neighbor's hedge the way Chloe Kim can with a snowboard and a half-pipe. But I believe that with grit, determination, and a little luck, I could someday be on your TV representing the United States in the Olympic games. Perhaps, if that time ever comes and you see me soaring majestically, high above a cardboard box at the center of a jam-packed arena, you, too, will be inspired to achieve greatness.

'There Is Beauty In Decay,' Says Head Of Federal Highway Administration While Surveying Nation's Crumbling Roads
CHICAGO — Inspecting a lengthy fissure cutting across two lanes of U.S. Route 34, Federal Highway Administration head Gregory G. Nadeau told reporters Wednesday that while the nation's infrastructure is in desperate need of repair, there was "a certain kind of beauty in decay." "Yes, it's easy to lament the wretched state of our country's crumbling roads, but let us not forget that it also allows us to appreciate the cycle of life as nature takes its course, for it reminds us that time — not man — is truly in control," said Nadeau, further musing that when seen in a different light, the pockmarked asphalt, rusted metal, and dilapidated concrete were almost picturesque in their unchecked deterioration, a poignant reminder of the fragility of even the grandest municipal visions. "Indeed, let us celebrate the splendor of something entirely new — this network of cracks here, that vast pothole there — being created from what was once an intact stretch of highway. The natural order gives birth to its own wonders." Members of the press were then instructed to close their eyes and take in the gentle patter of tires rolling over uneven pavement, after which Nadeau reportedly dashed into his car and sped away.

Report: Trying To Hug Oncoming Train Still Leading Cause Of Death For Nation's Idiots
GENEVA — Calling the literal embrace of high-speed rail traffic "an endemic among pea-brained morons across the country," the World Health Organization confirmed Friday that attempts at hugging oncoming trains remain the leading cause of death of idiots across the United States. "According to our research, roughly 31% of the nation's imbeciles die each year right after crouching on the tracks, slapping their thighs while saying 'Come to papa,' and then widely throwing open their arms to embrace an oncoming locomotive," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, who noted that more than 50,000 dipshit mortality cases annually are preceded by the deceased puckering their lips and crooning "somebody wants a kissie kiss" while placing a foot upon each rail. "Tragically, we continue to see dumbasses fatally assume a train's headlight is a beaming happy face headed towards them. Data indicate that a significant portion of this demographic also says 'The train is my best friend' before lumbering toward their doom with a moronic grin plastered on their face. Thus far, all efforts to curb these incidents through gesturing, yelling, or sounding the train's warning siren have resulted in delighted halfwits saying 'Choo choo!' or even 'I love you too, Mister Train.'" In less tragic news, Adhanom added that both jumping from a tree in attempts to fly alongside the birds and squeezing into cages to pet the pretty lions claimed the lives of roughly 5,000 fewer fucking dolts last year.

Dormant Supervolcano Underneath Yellowstone Figures Now As Good A Time As Any
JACKSON, WY — Taking note of the circumstances that were presently transpiring on the surface, the dormant supervolcano located 12 miles beneath Yellowstone National Park reportedly thought to itself Friday that now was probably just as good a time as any. "You know, I've gotta do this sooner or later, and frankly, this just feels like a pretty decent time to pull the trigger and go through with this thing, so why not?" the 11,200-cubic-mile magma chamber reportedly told itself, adding that after 630,000 years without a supereruption, and given the week the landmass above it had just endured, the time seemed right to unleash an explosion 1,000 times more powerful than the Mt. St. Helens eruption and blanket much of North America in several feet of fiery ash, immediately killing 90,000 people and setting off a nuclear winter that would slowly annihilate millions more. "It's been a while, and I mean, I'm more or less due on a geologic time scale, so today seems like a good enough day to me. I might as well just go for it, right?" At press time, the nation's citizens were breathing an immense sigh of relief as an onrushing wall of superheated gas and volcanic ejecta came hurtling toward them.

National Park Service Releases Detailed Guide On What Visitors Should Do Upon Encountering Squirrel
WASHINGTON — In their latest effort to educate and prepare the public for crossing the path of the ubiquitous rodents, the U. S. National Park Service released a detailed guide Friday advising visitors on what they should do if they encounter a squirrel. "We've published a step-by-step guide urging guests to remain absolutely still and try to 'make themselves appear big' by spreading their feet if they ever happen upon a squirrel in the wild," said Park Service Wildlife Management deputy director Dan Smith, who stressed that the Park Service had installed high-visibility signage in areas where large concentrations of the bushy-tailed animals are found. "Movies such as Ice Age would have you believe that squirrels are friendly, mischievous at worst, with absolutely no thirst for human blood or history of carrying off infants only to climb up trees with them and eat their pink little heads as if they were apples. But remember, these are feral animals, perfectly adapted to survive and thrive in a harsh environment. There are, in fact, several species of squirrels in North America, and our new materials will cover interactions with each one, although you'll want to avoid eye contact with all of them and absolutely safeguard your food when camping. And in the event that a squirrel does sprint off with your store of nuts, for the love of God, absolutely do not chase after them." The Park Service also announced that capsaicin-based anti-squirrel mace would be sold in all national park gift shops.

Rookie Forest Ranger Not Getting Hopes Up About Seeing Tree On First Day
SHERIDAN, WY — Lowering his expectations in an effort to avoid disappointment, rookie forest ranger TJ Hayward told reporters Friday that he was not getting his hopes up about seeing a tree on his first day of work. "If it happens, that would be great, but I'm not going to hold my breath for a lodgepole pine on day one," said Hayward, noting that one of his colleagues who has already been there over six months hasn't seen even a single spruce or fir yet. "Of course I'd love to come across a majestic aspen in the wild, but I know it could be years before that happens, if it happens at all. I'll just keep an eye out for any tree droppings that I may notice on the trails. I know that if I see a squirrel, there's probably a tree nearby." At press time, Hayward was speechless and on the verge of tears after stumbling upon a beautiful, towering wooden utility pole.

Clingy Wingstop Hounding Man With Dozens Of Messages After Single Drunken Night Together
CHICAGO — Expressing concerns that the restaurant chain had the wrong idea about where their relationship was headed, wing enthusiast Matthew Forester, 32, revealed Thursday that a clingy Wingstop has sent him dozens of messages since their one drunken night together. "Look, I know it was a passionate night during which I deeply satisfied certain appetites, but I haven't seen Wingstop in weeks, and yet they're still sending me desperate texts and emails offering me five free wings or telling me about their new ancho honey sauce," said Forester, who claimed he had never done anything with Wingstop since and had thought he made it clear that their late-night encounter would be a one-time thing. "They saw me stumble through the door. They know I was really drunk. We had fun, sure. At one point, I think I even drizzled about five kinds of sauce on them at once. But they should have gotten the point after I didn't respond to the first dozen messages. It was one night, it was just twenty lemon pepper wings, nothing more. Although, I am worried I might have said 'I love you' at one point." At press time, a drunken Forester has since been reportedly observed texting Wingstop for confirmation that his order of spicy Korean crispy tenders was on their way over.

Experts Unable To Determine Why Someone As Rich As Justin Bieber Even Needs To Believe In God Anymore
CAMBRIDGE, MA — Explaining that the evidence "simply does not add up," experts at Harvard Divinity School told reporters Monday that they were unable to comprehend why someone as rich as Justin Bieber even needs to believe in God anymore. "According to our research, there's no possible explanation as to what a divine deity could even offer that would appeal to a multimillionaire like Justin Bieber," said Dr. Frederick Tanner, who noted that the pop star has continued to proclaim his faith in God over the years despite the fact that every album he's ever released has easily shot straight to the top of the charts. "Look, we're researchers. We make next to nothing. God could help us, so it makes sense that we believe in God. But this guy is 25 years old and lives in a huge mansion. He performs sold-out shows before thousands of screaming fans every night. Frankly, it's foolish to believe in an interventionist God when you already have everything you could want." At press time, Tanner had dropped to his knees and declared that Justin Bieber was God.

Giants Consider Drafting Quarterback To Mentor Eli Manning
NEW YORK — Insisting that they didn't want to push the 38-year-old signal caller onto the field before he's ready, Giants general manager Dave Gettleman told reporters Tuesday that the team was considering drafting a quarterback to mentor Eli Manning. "I think it will be good to keep Eli on the bench for a year or two so he can learn the ropes of being an NFL quarterback," said Gettleman, noting that Manning could really benefit from watching and working with someone who had experience leading a Division I football team. "He's definitely got the talent, he's just raw. This will give him time to work on his mechanics and learn the playbook. Sometimes, you just need to be patient with someone like Eli, but it would be a shame if he was never given a chance to reach his true potential." Gettleman added that, barring injury, Eli probably wouldn't be ready for the starter role until the 2021 NFL season.

Jim Jordan Spends Hearing Demanding Michael Cohen Accept Blame For Covering Up Sexual Abuse Of Ohio State Wrestlers
WASHINGTON — Repeatedly attacking the credibility of President Trump's former lawyer and asking why the House Oversight Committee should believe anything he says, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) spent the bulk of his allotted time during Michael Cohen's hearing Thursday demanding that he accept blame for covering up the alleged sexual abuse of wrestlers at Ohio State University. "I am not sure how you expect us to just sit here and trust that you're actually going to tell the truth about your involvement with the president when you've said absolutely nothing about these scandalous abuse allegations — what are you hiding?" said Jordan, interrupting another congressperson's questioning to call attention to the fact that paperwork Cohen submitted ahead of the hearing contained nothing about knowing that hundreds of OSU wrestlers were abused by a team doctor, including during the period from 1986 to 1994 when Jordan served as an assistant coach. "Who are you to accuse the president of crimes given your shady past and connections to Ohio State? You're obviously only doing this to distance yourself from this disgraceful cover-up, and the fact that you won't admit to your role in it completely invalidates any shred of decency you might have. Frankly, sir, you are a disgrace to the Buckeyes." An irate Jordan also informed Cohen in front of the committee that it was particularly galling to hear that someone would turn around and betray those who had trusted him.

Report Reveals Jesus Christ May Have Benefited From Father's Influential Position To Gain High-Powered Role As Lord And Savior
NEW HAVEN, CT — In a groundbreaking new report on one of the most revered figures in religious history, top biblical scholars published findings Monday that suggest Jesus Christ may have relied on the influence of His well-connected father, God, to land His powerful role as Lord and Savior to mankind. Examining evidence from the Gospels, as well as recently unearthed ancient Christian and Gnostic texts, researchers at Yale Divinity School concluded that Christ's close familial relationship to the Creator of Heaven and Earth likely contributed to His meteoric rise from obscure carpenter to high-level divinity, giving Him a leg up over candidates who may have been more qualified for a position within the Holy Trinity. "The selection of Jesus to become the Messiah appears to be a clear-cut case of nepotism," said noted theologian and report co-author Philip Baxter, who remarked that in first-century Judea, it was widely believed John the Baptist was the frontrunner to sit at the right hand of the Father. "Until the age of 30, Christ's only employment had been as a laborer with His stepfather's woodworking business. So we must ask: How does someone with no background in management suddenly get put in charge of a 12-apostle team? And how exactly does a person with no prior experience as a monarch get appointed King of Kings?" "God likes to claim He moves in mysterious ways, but there doesn't seem to be too much mystery here at all," Baxter continued. "This looks like blatant favoritism." The scholars behind the report said revised translations of the Gospel of Luke reveal that during the Annunciation, the archangel Gabriel not only foretold the birth of Jesus but also mentioned to the Virgin Mary that he hoped soon to be promoted to Messiah and to deliver the Jews from bondage. The report states that Gabriel, with centuries of divine service behind him, was justifiably suspicious when he wound up relegated to his dead-end messenger job and the promotion instead went to Jesus, who just happened to be God's only begotten son. This reportedly created an atmosphere of low morale among God's longer-tenured servants, who believed the young Jesus would never have been given such a position if His father had not been He Who Reigns Supreme Over All That Is Seen And Unseen. "Jesus would go around telling this story of His humble beginnings, how He was born to a refugee seeking shelter in a manger, but in reality, He was a child of privilege," said Baxter, remarking that Jesus was well aware that His father, who had created the universe and everything in it, would always be able to provide for Him. "It was easy for Him to tell people, 'Ask, and it shall be given,' or 'Knock, and it shall be opened unto you,' because that's pretty much how life works if your dad is an all-powerful, all-knowing deity." "In the meantime, a lot of angels and prophets who had been angling for Jesus's position are looking on in disgust as this ne'er-do-well son goes around from party to party multiplying loaves and fishes and turning water into wine," Baxter added. Leaders of several Christian denominations denounced the report, arguing that Jesus earned His role on merit and was fully qualified to bring salvation to all mankind. According to a Vatican spokesman, God was "pretty hands-off" in His son's career, and, if anything, Jesus had to work twice as hard to get out from underneath the Heavenly Father's shadow. Meanwhile, a representative from the Eastern Orthodox Church sought to rebut the report's claim that Jesus never actually fasted in the desert, but instead went on a 40-day-and-night-long bender to escape the responsibilities of his ministry. Nonetheless, the report does document occasions on which God appears to have pulled strings on His son's behalf: For example, Jesus was allowed to retain His position as Lord and Savior despite a criminal record that came to include violating the Sabbath, multiple acts of sorcery, and disorderly conduct in a Jewish temple. "Even after He was condemned to death and crucified, His father still intervened to make sure Jesus didn't face any lasting consequences for His actions," Baxter said in reference to God raising His son from the dead. "Most people don't bounce back from a mistake like that. Most people don't get that second chance." "No one swooped in three days later to resurrect John the Baptist after he was beheaded, that's for sure," Baxter added. Baxter went on to describe how God sought to burnish His son's reputation by enlisting Christ's apostles to co-write a lengthy biography, an apparent attempt to control the narrative that presents a sanitized portrait of the time Jesus spent on Earth. He cited in particular the epistles by Paul, John, and others, which he called "little more than letters of recommendation written on Jesus's behalf." "The New Testament goes so far as to blame Jesus's entire crucifixion on mankind — suddenly, He died for our sins," Baxter said. "That's quite a brazen claim, but it's not widely disputed, because His connections go all the way to the top, and anyone who comes forward could be struck down instantly for speaking out."

Report: Little League Pitchers Could Avoid Overtaxing Their Arms By, You Know, Getting Somebody Out
ATLANTA — Stressing that it was a simple solution to avoid long-term injuries, researchers from Emory Healthcare published a report Friday suggesting that Little League pitchers could avoid overtaxing their arms by, you know, getting somebody out for a change. "We strongly recommend young pitchers avoid needless strain on their ligaments and tendons by actually throwing some balls over the goddamn plate," said Director Of Sports Medicine Neeru Jayanthi, asserting pitch counts and extended rest would not be necessary if young players would just do what they were sent out on the mound to do. "We're truly horrified when we see reports of starters throwing 70-plus pitches, when young players wouldn't have to throw more than 50 if they could figure how to get that curveball to break away from the hitter and not right into the barrel of his fucking bat. Another surefire way to avoid wear and tear is to stop walking batters. Pitchers are having Tommy John surgery earlier and earlier these days, so we really can't stress the value of doing this little exercise called 'striking someone out.' " Jayanthi urged players who were really worried about the threat of injury to just quit because they're clearly not cut out for the sport.

Lin-Manuel Miranda: 'You People Are Giving Me Too Much Fucking Money'
NEW YORK — Noting the fat paychecks he'd received for his work on Broadway and in Hollywood, Hamilton star Lin-Manuel Miranda announced Thursday that "You people are giving me too much fucking money." "Holy hell, I wrote one musical about a founding father, and you goddamn lunatics are throwing millions of dollars at me like I invented theater or something. Get a grip," said Miranda, who wondered aloud if Disney would still have paid $75 million to acquire the rights to his play, Hamilton, if they knew he'd "shit it out in one night after reading the dude's biography." "Why am I getting paid to go on late-night shows and freestyle with the host? Or voice a cartoon character in an episode of some animated show? I'm touched you all liked the rap songs, but stop with the big bucks because it's getting embarrassing. I'm just one guy in an entire industry of people struggling to make any money at all." Miranda urged anyone who wanted to give him more money to instead "throw some cash at whoever wrote Wicked because that shit is incredible."

Aging Tom Cruise No Longer Able To Climb Outer Wall Of Skyscraper Without Taking Break Halfway Through
SAN DIEGO — As Tom Cruise rested on a window ledge 300 feet in the air and took a sip of water Friday, onlookers remarked that the 57-year-old actor was really showing his age by taking a break midway through his scaling of One America Plaza. "It's tough to watch how winded he gets nowadays, especially after he gets past the 14th or 15th floor of a building," said Paramount Pictures CEO Jim Gianopulos, who has worked with Cruise on the Mission Impossible franchise and the forthcoming Top Gun: Maverick, explaining that a skyscraper climb that might have taken the star just 20 minutes a decade ago now takes up to an hour. "Tom probably needs to be more realistic about the expectations he's placing on his body in middle age. He'll be running from a moving train and Henry Cavill or someone will dart right past him and he'll get so upset. I'll tell him, 'It's okay! You're older now. You're allowed to hold on to the side of a jet with two hands instead of just one!' " At press time, disappointed sources reported seeing Cruise hanging from a construction crane near the 29th floor trying to work out a charley horse.

Onion Social CEO Rebukes 480,000 Crimes At International Criminal Tribunal Including Illegal Surveillance, Insider Trading, Mass Murder, Indecent Exposure
THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS — In a fierce and heated defense of his conduct while running the world's largest and most respected social media company, Onion Social CEO Jeremy Rosenbaum rebuked 480,000 International Criminal Court charges in testimony Thursday, including illegal surveillance, insider trading, mass murder, petty treason, high treason, animal cruelty, blasphemy, and identity theft. "Ladies and gentlemen, I come before you today to deny every one of the charges unfairly leveled against me and my company, most notably these trumped-up claims of patent infringement, misuse of user data, racketeering, hate crimes, grand larceny, genocide of indigenous tribes, public indecency, mail fraud, incest, and sponsoring terrorism," said Rosenbaum, who repeatedly asserted there was also nothing to substantiate the court's near half-million allegations of illegal monopoly practices, deforestation, pyramid schemes, unlawful human experimentation on thousands of users, bestiality, desecration of a temple, plotting the overthrow of the grand duke of Luxembourg, unlicensed whaling, inciting mayhem, and 17 charges of necrophilia. "Onion Social was established earlier this week as a small startup with the simple goal of bringing the world closer together, and what little truth there is to these outrageous accusations — such as violating child labor laws, sex slavery, piracy on the high seas, biowarfare, human sacrifice, and consorting with sorcerers — is simply the result of a well-intentioned company trying its best to cope with rapid growth. Anyone would have made the same mistakes." At press time, Rosenbaum had last been spotted fleeing the court while the justices discussed an obscure statute on mass murder not used since the 2012 trial of Bosnian general Ratko Mladić.

White House Concerned Ryan Zinke Made Land Deal Without Giving Cut To Trump
WASHINGTON — Confirming the administration had launched a Justice Department investigation into the U.S. secretary of the interior's conduct, the White House revealed Friday that it was concerned Ryan Zinke had made a land deal without giving a cut to President Trump. "Mounting evidence indicates that Secretary Zinke may have acted improperly by making money off of a private land development deal without letting President Trump wet his beak," said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, confirming that Zinke's role in the development of a business and retail park near land in Montana that he and his wife own may have run afoul of White House rules for skimming some profits off the top for the president. "At no time did Mr. Zinke inform us about which Trump Organization bank account he would be depositing the president's kickback into, nor have we received an envelope full of unmarked bills slipped under the Oval Office door. We are extremely disappointed that the secretary would use his office to enrich himself without also enriching the president." White House officials added that while they were committed to investigating Zinke for potential impropriety, they wanted to reassure Americans that the vast majority of federal employees always followed protocol in giving a cut of the profits from their private-sector hustles to the president.

Report: New iPhone Will No Longer Secretly Record Every Word You Say
CUPERTINO, CA — In a surprising elimination of one of the product's oldest features, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced at a product unveiling Tuesday that the new iPhone 8 will no longer secretly record every word you say. "Although the iPhone 8 will be our most advanced device yet, it will not have the capability to clandestinely preserve every single thing that comes out of your mouth," said Cook, explaining that, for the first time in its 10-year history, the iPhone will not come installed with a voice-activated recording device that automatically sends audio files of users' conversations directly to Apple headquarters. "That said, it's worth emphasizing that this change in no way affects the functionality of older phones, which will not only continue to gather every spoken word but also permanently archive all your text messages regardless of whether you actually elected to store them in the cloud." Cook went on to say that removing the audio recording device helped create additional space for a longer-lasting battery that allows the phone's camera to capture video of users 24 hours a day.

Trump Ties Thousands Of Balloons To White House Roof In Attempt To Sail Away From Impeachment Inquiry
WASHINGTON — In an effort to evade the escalating Ukraine scandal, President Donald Trump reportedly tied thousands of balloons to the roof of the White House Thursday in order to sail far away from the impeachment inquiry. "The U.S. has turned against me, so it's time for me to float off to some distant land," said the president, crouching next to a balustrade on the White House roof and blowing air into balloon after balloon. "All right, Mick [Mulvaney], time for you to jump out the window to lighten the load. Just a few thousand more and I'll be aloft. If the wind holds, I should make it to Saudi Arabia by morning. Farewell! On to my next great adventure!" At press time, dozens of House GOP members were holding a press conference outside the White House to describe how beautiful and majestic the president looked flying through the air.

Tracking Trump Administration Turnover
The recent departures of DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secret Service director Randolph Alles have been the latest in the historically high turnover among top officials in the Trump administration. The Onion takes a look at the administration's highest-profile departures during President Trump's two-plus years in office. The populist chief strategist was ousted from the White House when it became increasingly clear that his views on turning the U.S. into an ethnostate weren't strong enough. Trump's vocal support of white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville upset the former chief economic advisor so much that he resigned the very next eight months later. The original first lady returned to her native Slovenia in May 2018. The former deputy press secretary left the administration for the more traditional reason of joining a lobbying firm. Actually, he's somehow still there. Hey, remember when this guy was one of the most famous people in the world for a little while? Anyway, he resigned, and we're not sure what he's doing now. The one-time communications strategist departed after it became clear his skills at covering up sexual harassment allegations would be put to better use in a role with Trump's reelection campaign. He mostly just delivered mail and coffee, but Ted brightened up any room he was in. Everyone's excited he's going back to school to be a nurse. Good luck, Ted! The resignation of Trump's U.N. ambassador left his administration with one less person bizarrely perceived by the media as a moderate.

The Anemic Economic Recovery Is Due To The Failed Policies Of My Opponent vs.
C'mon Man, The Debate's In A Couple Hours, We Can Do This Then If there's one thing I've learned campaigning across this great country of ours, it's that hardworking Americans are doing their God's honest best in these trying economic times. But unfortunately, far too many families that were once solidly middle-class now have a tough time paying their bills and, in some cases, struggle just to put meals on the table. We've been promised an economic recovery for four years, folks, and I don't need to tell you that it hasn't come to pass. That's why it's time for a change — a real, lasting change from the ineffective and costly policies of my opponent, which have done nothing but slow this recovery down. Time and time again, we've been told by this administration that things will get better, that we're finally turning a corner. They say their expensive stimulus package and burdensome financial regulations are working. But let me ask you: Does the small business owner who can't pay her tax bill believe the economy is improving? How about that family in Florida whose mortgage is still under water? Just look around, folks — it's plain to see this so-called recovery is anything but. In President Obama's first year alone, 4.1 million jobs were lost, and today the unemployment rate is still above 8 percent. Ladies and gentlemen, that is simply unacceptable in the United States of America, and as president, I will not stand for it. We all remember how my opponent rode into office on a wave of popular support and promised fixing the economy would be job No. 1. We were told help was on the way for the jobless and for those losing their homes. But what we got instead was a bloated, ineffective stimulus bill that added nearly $800 billion to the deficit. The bottom line is that four years later Americans haven't seen their paychecks rise or their prospects brighten, and the reason is simple: My opponent policies have only dug our nation deeper into debt. And that's why we need a leader who knows a thing or two about creating jobs. I have a lifetime of experience in the private sector and, unlike my opponent, I know that more government is not the answer. I know that unburdening our small businesses from the yoke of taxes and regulation will promote the entrepreneurial spirit that has always lifted this country out of recessions. It's time to say goodbye to President Obama's broken, bankrupting policies, and that's exactly what I plan on doing if you elect me president. Whoa, hey, buddy, take 'er easy. Slow down there. I know we have starkly different viewpoints on key issues facing the nation, but come on, the debate's in just a couple hours, so relax for a bit and we can get to all that stuff then. I promise. Seriously, pal, settle down and take a breath. We've got 90 minutes blocked off tonight to cover all the big issues, so you'll have more than enough time to make your points in front of the American people. But right now, how about you just hang out and enjoy the rest of the day. It's beautiful here in Denver. You don't want to tire yourself out two hours before your opening remarks, do you? Save it for when it really counts, you know what I mean? That's what I'm doing. The economy, jobs, housing — I promise we'll get to it, just hold your horses. It makes perfect sense that you have a lot of stuff on your mind and you're champing at the bit to get it all out. I ought to know. This is a very high-stakes night for me, too, and I also am looking forward to having a spirited discussion about the choice Americans have to make. But there's a time and a place for it, buddy, and it's not here. You don't see me getting all worked up, do you? Just take a breather. Eat a sandwich. Mitt, the bottom line is that the entire debate is focused on domestic policy, so it's not like small business owners and job creation aren't going to come up. What's the difference if we talk about it now or two hours from now? See what I mean? You don't even have to hold off that much longer. Put on a movie, and by the time it's over, boom, it's debate time. Listen, you and me are going to appear live on all the major networks and cable news channels very shortly, and you'll be able to talk about the housing crisis, my broken promises on the unemployment rate, and anything else you want, for that matter. There's going to be a set, a moderator, cameras, an audience, tens of millions of Americans watching at home. What I'm saying here, man, is that it's not like this isn't going to happen. It's a full-on debate with no commercials. To me, that sounds like a perfect opportunity to get this stuff off your chest. You know I'm right on this. Plus, we've got two more of these things later on, so even if you forget to say something up there tonight, there's still plenty of debating left, okay? I guarantee you'll be able to get across the exact message that you'd like the American people to hear. Swear to God. Mitt, I'll be honest with you, I actually don't even have time to respond to this right now. I have a country to run, high-level officials to talk to — really, I'm pretty much booked until this debate tonight. But I guarantee I'll get back to you then. Sound good, bud? Mitt Romney and Barack Obama

Dazed Marco Rubio Wakes Up In Koch Compound To Find Cold Metal Device Installed Behind Ear
'Hello Marco, We Will Now Begin The Program,' Says Soothing Voice UNKNOWN LOCATION — The brightly lit, stark-white room gradually coming into focus as he regained consciousness, GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio reportedly awoke in the Koch brothers' secret compound Thursday and reached suddenly to his throbbing head to discover a cold metal device implanted behind his left ear. As Rubio sat up slowly on a steel cot — the room otherwise empty except for a large Koch Industries logo emblazoned on one wall — sources said he was startled to hear a soothing voice reverberating inside his aching skull, evidently emanating from the smooth metal disk that he gingerly touched while panic began to well in his chest. "Hello, Marco," said the oddly familiar voice. "We are very pleased to have you as our guest. We have so much planned for you." "Remember, what's best for us is best for you, Marco. Now, let's begin with an exercise on threats to American free enterprise and prosperity." "Now that you've rested, we can begin," the voice continued. Rubio, whose heart was reportedly racing, is said to have broken into a cold sweat as he frantically tried to piece together the hazy details from the night before. Though he could vaguely recall having attended a fundraising dinner at the Cato Institute the previous evening, the presidential candidate was reportedly only able to remember drinking a strange-tasting glass of champagne at the event before everything went blank, leaving him without any recollection of the intervening hours before he awoke in the windowless, featureless room somewhere inside the Koch brothers' sprawling subterranean facility. According to sources, a scared and confused Rubio then absentmindedly felt for his phone and watch, only to discover that his clothes had been replaced with a white jumpsuit featuring an ID tag reading "2016 CANDIDATE #0003." "There's no need to panic — you'll be back to campaigning just as soon as our session is complete," said the voice as Rubio searched in vain for a door or an exit of some kind along the room's perfectly smooth walls. "Remember, what's best for us is best for you, Marco. Now, let's begin with an exercise on threats to American free enterprise and prosperity." Reports indicate that Rubio then saw the words "Now Importing Lesson" overlaid across his field of vision before hundreds of lines of conservative policy papers and essays relating to the detrimental effects of government regulation on business began scrolling in front of his eyes. Sources confirmed that the senator was then forced to repeat thousands of talking points about how outdated labor regulations empower unions without actually creating opportunities for workers, and was repeatedly prompted by the voice to give a detailed explanation as to how a preferred plan that drastically cuts corporate taxes would create jobs. When Rubio fumbled an answer or paused for too long, he would reportedly be brought to his knees by a piercing, high-decibel frequency, followed by the voice calmly suggesting that he "try to pay a little closer attention." After Rubio was finally able to argue to the voice's satisfaction that pending environmental protection legislation would ultimately hurt everyday consumers, a slot is said to have opened in the wall and a tray containing a glass of water and three slices of bread was pushed through. "We are delighted by your progress, Marco," said the voice as a visibly weak and hungry Rubio threw himself at the food. "Remember, we will always reward your hard work, here and outside this room." With no way of keeping time and without any connection to the outside world, sources said the Florida senator lost track of how long he had been in the room, and following an indeterminate number of hours of instruction, began to forget what his original stance on entitlements and immigration reform had been. Rubio, who completed nearly a dozen drills on subjects ranging from natural gas pipelines to private health insurance, reportedly reached his breaking point when he failed to articulate his position against the Wind Production Tax Credit after 15 consecutive attempts. The fatigued presidential hopeful is said to have then curled up into a fetal position on the bare floor, rocking back and forth while whimpering, "What more do you want from me? Please, God, just let me out. Please." "Perhaps you have forgotten, Marco, that we want to help you," said the voice, growing louder in Rubio's ear. "But we can't help you if you do not cooperate, now can we?" Overcome with desperation, Rubio is then said to have repeatedly slammed his body against the blank white walls of his room. After several futile attempts, sources said the candidate proceeded to claw violently at the skin behind his ear in an apparent attempt to dislodge the device. "I'm afraid you cannot leave until your session is complete, Marco," said the voice as a thick, white cloud of gas filled the room from unseen vents, causing Rubio to slump to the floor and begin losing consciousness. "We have invested too much in you."

Sustainable Energy Solutions Are The Key To Our Country's Economic Future vs.
Christ, Ted, Is That You? It's Four In The Morning Time and time again, the United States finds itself on the brink of economic disaster, and all because we have tethered ourselves to an unstable energy source: oil. This reliance leaves us both susceptible to the volatility of an unstable market and defenseless against the cyclical havoc it creates in our economy. We continually vow to change our ways, but as soon as prices go back down, we're right back where we started, feeding our oil addiction. Now we are at a crossroads: We can either choose to pursue a global leadership position at the forefront of green energy solutions, or we can hide our heads in the sand. And unless we want to be viewed by history as another fallen empire, it's pretty obvious that we must choose sustainable energy. Naysayers insist that we lack the basic infrastructure to do this, and that we are simply not prepared for the paradigm shifts necessary to take advantage of solar or wind power. Well, to those who say America is not ready for these changes, I say you're dead wrong. Investment in renewable energy today will create hundreds of thousands of desperately needed jobs and prepare us for a stable, emissions-free future in which our fortunes are not tied to the chaos of the world around us. Do the recent events in the Middle East tell us nothing? It's not just hurting us at the pump; it's driving up prices of everyday essentials, such as heating oil, food, and clothing. It's now or never. Do we want to tell our children and our children's children that we met our ruin because we failed to act? I should hope not. The bottom line is this: If the United States of America expects to maintain its position as a dominant world power, we must be able to maintain consistent, sustainable growth. And the key to that growth is consistent, sustainable energy. Hello? Who is this? Wait, just — slow down. Whoever this is needs to slow down. Jesus Christ, Ted, is that you? Ted, what the fuck, man? Do you have any idea what time it is? It's four in the goddamn morning. What the hell is — Ted, please stop talking for a second. † Yes, Ted, I agree the creation of wind and solar infrastructure will create jobs where they are sorely needed, but for God's sake, this couldn't have waited till tomorrow? Jesus, okay. Just give me a second here. Okay. Okay. I'm awake. No, yeah, I'm awake. Okay, first off, where are you right now? Are you okay? Is everything okay? For fuck's sake, Ted, I thought somebody had died or something. My hands are shaking. My heart is…I thought it was something with my parents or my sister or, I don't know, some kind of emergency. Yes, Ted, I realize being tied to an outdated and dangerously unstable energy source is an emergency. I get that. But come on, man, it's still fucking dark outside. I gotta be up in two hours. I have to make breakfast for the kids, I have to get them dressed, get them on the bus. Sure, yes, fine, I agree it would be great if their bus didn't burn gas, but forgive me if I'm not in the mood to list the benefits of a hydrogen-powered auto fleet right now. Ugh, I'm so tired. I was in a really deep sleep, too. Fuck. No, no, no, I'm not mad. I'm not mad. Well, yeah, I guess I am a little mad. Don't get me wrong, man, I fundamentally agree with everything you're saying about the cyclical economic effect of fuel costs and how America has to take the lead in changing energy paradigms, but Ted, there's nothing you, me, or anyone is gonna do about it at four in the morning, so can we drop it? Call me at the office tomorrow and we'll talk, okay? I need my sleep. I need…Ted, why are you still talking about maintaining sustainable growth? And why is your voice so loud? Ted. Ted. Ted, seriously. Seriously, Ted, you gotta stop. You can't keep waking me up in the middle of the night every time you get riled up about something. Last week it was that global warming is a danger we can no longer afford to ignore, and the week before it was about how the drug cartels in Mexico have rendered Latin American governments virtually powerless. All very good points, Ted, but Sheila's starting to get pissed off and, frankly, so am I. You're a passionate guy and I respect that, but do you have any idea the day I have ahead of me? Great, now Sheila's up, and she's making coffee. I'm never getting back to sleep now. Fuck. I wish you could hear yourself, Ted. You sound nuts. No, of course I don't want to be viewed by history as a fallen empire. You know what, how about a fucking apology for waking my children up, you asshole? Their children's children are going to bear the brunt? Hey, Ted, fuck you. Go to bed. Theodore Tremelstam and Bill Tracy

Your Obsessive Love Or Hatred Of Me Means Nothing In The Grand Scheme Of Geological Time
As the undisputed No. 1 teen pop sensation in the world, I have become something of a fulcrum upon which the extremes of human emotion pivot. On one side, you have people who have vaunted me to such lofty heights it is tantamount to deification; on the other, my high-spirited song-and-dance routines elicit an almost murderous rage. But, I ask, when viewed within the context of the geologic timescale, wherein chronological development is measured by evolutionary and stratigraphic events over countless eons rather than transitory human experience, what does any of it truly matter? Quite simply put, it doesn't. Your adoration or loathing of me, a 17-year-old entertainer from Canada, is no more significant than a grain of sand on a beach, disappearing when Earth's mighty oceans rise and then retreat — as they will hundreds of thousands of millions of times until the sun is extinguished and the pyramids, the Taj Mahal, Rick Ross, the Great Wall of China, and everything else even remotely related to our feeble, fleeting species are but forgotten whispers in one planet's geochronology. Ask yourself: What then will all your hyperbolic reverence or vitriolic bile even mean? To what do your hours spent online fawning over or vilifying me because of my Grammy performance amount when compared to a recent scientific finding that, as the Pacific and North American tectonic plates collide, the mountains north of Los Angeles will, over the next 100 million years, grow to peaks higher than the Himalayas, only to be eroded down to pebbles by millennia of wind and rain? Forgive me. But please don't think that because of my fame I place myself above the futile scrabbling of mankind and its ephemeral perception of me as being either "adorable" or "the worst"; quite the contrary. In fact, it is because of my celebrity that I know I matter no more or less than any other human being among the many billions living or dead. When I tweet about the fact that I have cut my iconic hair and it is re-tweeted 300,000 times in a day, there is no better juxtaposition than to place that trifling 24 hours against the 10,000 years it will take Byrd Glacier to move across Antarctica's vast expanses of silent white. In many ways, grasping the infinitesimal speck humanity constitutes is a source of great comfort. Even while I am in the midst of recording vocals in the studio or appearing on a daytime television program, it is admittedly seductive to stop for a moment and stare unblinking into the void and consider that, in terms of the ever-widening parabola made by the imperceptible slowing of Earth's axis, soon everything — this planet, the moon, myself, the Milky Way galaxy, Usher, and all of your pointless mooning and disdain — will be forever silenced by the unstoppable spiral into total entropy. Even the faintest memory of my dear, sweet friend Ellen DeGeneres will be swallowed by the cataclysmic crush of all matter collapsing in on itself. I suppose we've come to the point where we should just plainly state the ugly truth of all this: If you expend any energy at all either obsessively doting on me or hating me with the very fiber of your being, then I'm sad to say you are squandering your brief window as a cognizant being in this universe. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you how better to use your comically tiny duration of sentience. Perhaps tell your family you love them; ponder the intricate beauty of a dew-flecked spiderweb; listen to Nicki Minaj's very good studio debut Pink Friday. In the end, however, none of these things will matter all that much either, not in the great and widening chasm of geological time — let alone when one considers the age of the cosmos from which it has sprung. But maybe in these ways you can draw a brief moment of respite from the existential dread. Ultimately, I believe that this is all one can reasonably hope for. There is no God.

Heartbreaking Rubio Campaign Email Just Asks Supporters To Send Something To Make Him Smile
MIAMI — Noting that Tuesday's primary contests could very likely determine the outcome of the Republican nomination, Marco Rubio's presidential campaign reportedly sent a heartbreaking email to supporters Monday urging them to send the candidate something that might make him smile. "With just one day left until critical primary elections in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois, and Missouri, Marco needs your support more than ever! Contributing your signature to a nice e-card for Marco, or even sending him a link to a fun YouTube video will really help him out — anything to let him know you're thinking about him," read the agonizingly poignant email in part, replacing the typical monetary donation links within the message with suggestions that supporters "Write Him An Encouraging Note" or "Draw Him A Picture." "If you're able, you could email Marco a photograph of you wearing your Rubio 2016 shirt. He would really love that. Remember, no gesture is too big or too small to buoy his spirits at this critical juncture in the campaign." The email reportedly closed with one final encouragement that supporters make whatever effort they could to warm Rubio's heart, emphasizing that the campaign would not be asking for anything further after this.

Pompeo Clarifies Anyone In Country Can Listen In On Trump Administration Calls By Picking Up Phone, Dialing 9
WASHINGTON — Explaining that his presence on a phone call where President Donald Trump reportedly asked the president of Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden was completely above board, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo clarified Wednesday that anyone in the country can listen in on Trump administration phone calls by picking up their phones and dialing 9. "I'm not sure why the left-wing media and Democrats are so obsessed with the fact that I was on the Ukraine call when anyone in America can join simply by dialing 9 — just remember to hit the pound key afterward and it should take you right in," said Pompeo, further clarifying that while service was a little bit spotty in Alaska and some remote areas in the western states, any U.S. resident with a phone could otherwise access every Trump administration call at any time. "Whenever you want to listen to what Trump's up to, just hit the 9 key. If the line fills up after the first million people, just press 8 and it'll take you to a different teleconferencing room. I thought everyone knew about the free administration phone line. We just ask that you stay on mute unless you have something meaningful to add, since it can get kind of chaotic in there. Heck, I was listening in on Trump's calls with foreign leaders from day one of his administration, way before I was secretary of state. You can learn all kinds of things. And don't worry, you can listen in from outside the country too — you just need your three-digit country code, although data rates may apply." At press time, Pompeo was kicking back after dialing 9 and being immediately added to a call in which Trump was trying to convince French president Emmanuel Macron to back a potential military action against Iran.

My Sister Actually Went To School With Ryan Reynolds' Brother vs.
Cool, I Like You More As A Person Now You know, it's funny that you mention Ryan Reynolds, because my sister actually went to the same college as Ryan Reynolds' brother. Yeah, my sister Stephanie. You've met her. Remember, at the barbecue over at Josh's place last summer, when she and her husband were in town for the Fourth of July? Yeah. Anyway, she went to school with Ryan Reynolds' brother. I mean, she didn't know him all that well. The brother. His name is Greg. Yeah, Greg Reynolds. But she knew him because they had the same Astronomy 101 class. Yeah, astronomy. I know, right? You wouldn't think she would be into astronomy at all, the way she partied! But I guess they had to take something for the science requirement, and astronomy had the least math, so a lot of people ended up taking that one. Interesting thing is, when she met him, she didn't even know he was related to Ryan Reynolds at all. She just thought of him as this guy Greg. It was like halfway through the semester and she was talking to her roommate, Kendra or something? Kirsten? I can't even remember her roommate's name anymore, but apparently, she explained to my sister that she had seen this guy Greg at a keg party in her dorm, and Ryan Reynolds was there! Yeah, I guess he was visiting his brother for the weekend or something. She said he was totally cool. Yeah, and after the keg party was out, apparently he went out with them all to the bar and bought everybody a round on him. From what my sister said, apparently he was totally down to earth, didn't act like a big deal or anything, just a regular guy. I think this was after he was with Alanis Morissette, because apparently he had some girlfriend there with him, visiting, but it wasn't Alanis Morissette. But yeah, anyway. Ryan Reynolds' brother. Pretty crazy. Really, your sister went to college with Ryan Reynolds' brother? That is amazing. I like you so much more as a human being now that you've explained that to me. Your social standing, in my eyes, has just skyrocketed due to your tertiary association with this famous person, whose name I recognize, and whom I've seen in movies. I'm not sure if this was your intention when you related that anecdote to me, but I am much, much more interested in talking to you now that Ryan Reynolds has entered the equation. Pardon me for a moment while I sit back and try to take this new information in, and fully recognize just how much it changes everything between us. I want to hear more about you now. I am more interested in you, and in being your friend, after having heard about the connection between you and Ryan Reynolds. He is a person in celebrity culture magazines. But this is no magazine: This is real life. And that's precisely what makes it so astounding. You, through your sister, are associated, albeit distantly, with Ryan Reynolds, and therefore, I want to be associated with you. Can we hang out more often now? Maybe, somehow, your social link with Ryan Reynolds will be transferred to me, and I will then be that much closer to the magical world of celebrity and fame, through knowing you. You see, not everybody has a social link to a famous person. And famous people are special because they are famous and more important than regular people. Thus, the fact that you have a sister who went to school with Ryan Reynolds' brother, and the fact that Ryan Reynolds is a movie star, means that you yourself are more important and interesting as a person, and that I am too, by virtue of the fact that I know you. Moreover, your relating to me a salient detail concerning Ryan Reynold's romantic history impresses me greatly, as it further illustrates the fact that you have a higher level of access to the life of movie star Ryan Reynolds than the average person does. I am going to tell all of my friends and acquaintances about this, and they will all be envious and want to know more. Not just about Ryan Reynolds, but about you, and how I know you, and how well I know you. Then they will tell their friends and they will all be envious too, and they will respect me more as a person because I know you, just as I respect you more because you have a sister who went to the same college as Greg Reynolds, brother of Ryan Reynolds. Then they will want to know more about me, and so on. Thank God you told me this. Otherwise, I would never have known I should like you more. I feel so much better about myself by knowing you. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, sincerely — thank you. Erin Bachelder and Marissa Lange

Romney Throws Quinceañera For Ann In Last-Minute Attempt To Get Hispanic Vote
SANFORD, FL — With election day looming, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney tried one last time Monday to cut into Barack Obama's large lead among Latino voters by putting on an elaborate quinceañera celebration for his wife, Ann. "Today, Ann became a woman," said Romney, who mentioned that he helped Ann choose the gorgeous, jeweled white-and-yellow dress she wore as she danced a traditional waltz for an audience assembled in the basement of the Spanish Church of God. "From the cutting of the cake, to the 15-candle ceremony, to the changing of the shoes that symbolized her changing from girlhood to womanhood, this was Ann's very own special day. We are all so proud of her." Sources also confirmed the customary gift-giving reception following the quinceañera garnered several hundred thousand dollars in donations for the Romney campaign.

Melania Wishes Just Once She Could Look In Mirror Without Own Reflection Turning Away, Gust Of Wind Blowing Through Room, Doors Slamming Shut
WASHINGTON — Letting out a deep sigh while peering at the polished metal surface, Melania Trump confessed Wednesday that she wished she could look in the mirror just once without her own reflection turning away, a gust of wind blowing through the window, and every nearby door slamming shut. "All I want is to be able to check my makeup without awakening an ancient evil, causing the floorboards to shake and glasses of water to freeze solid," said the first lady, lamenting the fact that since moving into the White House, she had constantly been faced with a barrage of demonic whispers coming from within the walls and a swarm of locusts that seemed to appear out of thin air. "Just the other day, I saw myself in a windowpane, and the sky immediately turned blood-red, several birds fell from the sky, and my reflection turned into a skeleton. It's just so irritating — 48 hours later and my ears still haven't stopped ringing." At press time, the first lady was nowhere to be found after she reportedly looked into a mirror, saw a fiery portal open up behind her, and was sucked in with a deafening scream.

Mute, Terrified Rubio Awakes To Find Self Unable To Vocalize Any Unscripted Sentiment
MIAMI — Just hours after delivering the final speech of his 2016 campaign, former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio reportedly awoke Wednesday to the terrifying realization that he was unable to vocalize any unscripted sentiment. Sources said Rubio first noticed his horrifying condition upon sitting down at the breakfast table when he attempted to greet his family but could only produce a series of strained, heavy wheezes. The panicked Florida senator reportedly then clutched his throat as he struggled to articulate an unrehearsed expression of love for his wife and children, sputtering as he frantically searched for a memorized line of dialogue that had been carefully vetted and honed over many hours of coaching sessions. Concerned family members confirmed that, without a meticulously constructed text to work from, Rubio was forced to rely solely on hand gestures and grunts to convey any thoughts that passed through his mind. Upon realizing that his voice would only return when a heavily workshopped and polished phrase was placed before him to recite, the former presidential hopeful reportedly canceled his final goodbye speech to his staff until the heartfelt message could be revised numerous times and typed out for him in full. When reached for comment, a despondent Rubio moaned quietly.

I Know It's Crazy, But Some Days I Feel Like Everybody Is Out To Get Me vs.
Our Mission Has Been Compromised! Abort! Ever had one of those days where nothing seems to go right? I sure have. When everything is falling apart and you just can't get ahead, it's like the whole world is out to get you. Today was just like that. Last night, I know I checked to make sure my alarm was set before I went to bed, because it was really important that I got to work on time for this meeting we're having with the people from Chicago. But wouldn't you know it — Murphy's Law! No alarm went off and I woke up with only 15 minutes to get out the door. Come on, universe. Give me a break! So I figured I had just enough time for a quick shower, but my roommate was taking forever in there and, when I finally got my turn, the tub was all clogged up. All I could do was splash water on my face, throw on some clothes, and run for the bus. Well, guess what? It pulled away right as I got to the bus stop. I tell you, sometimes it's like the entire world is conspiring against me! But did the trouble stop there? Of course not. The next bus was 10 minutes late and the only seat left had a popsicle melted all over it, so I had to stand. By the time I got to work, the meeting was already over and boy did my boss run me through the ringer. I tried to tell him that it wasn't my fault, but he wouldn't listen to me. And the disasters just kept on coming. After lunch, my computer crashed, I lost the document I spent all morning working on, my stapler jammed, and I had to stay late to catch up. When I finally got home, I had an answering machine message from the boy I went on a date with last week, but he didn't leave his number. All that stuff just doesn't happen to a normal person in one day, right? Man alive, it couldn't get worse if someone were actually planning it! I wish I could say that the rest of my week has been better, but that's just not the case. On Monday, it was a nice day, so I decided to ride my bike in to work. About halfway there, I got a flat tire. I didn't think a lot of it, because there was a bike shop about three blocks away. I had them install a new inner tube, but when I went to pay, I realized I had forgotten my wallet at home. I had to leave my bike there until I could pay for it — which means "Unlucky Liz" walked the last mile and a half! At lunch, I spilled balsamic dressing all over my white shirt and, if that weren't enough, it started to rain on the way back to the bike shop and I got totally soaked. Sometimes, I think that everybody is in on it, and they won't rest until my day is ruined. But that's just nuts, isn't it? No. No. No. Dear God, this is the moment we feared. She's on to us. Blue Team, pull out! Repeat, PULL OUT. Mission Make Liz Hawkins' Life Insufferable has been compromised. Execute code Omega. Teams Salad Dressing and Minor Computer Malfunctions, abandon your stations. Abandon your stations! This is not a drill. I want you all out of there. Now! Let's move! Move! Move! Where are my visuals? Is the roommate operative still in place? Tell her that her cover's blown and we can no longer guarantee her safety. She needs to get out of that apartment. Repeat: Leave the dog and return to base immediately. If she doesn't pull the decoy alarm clock and those microphones we installed in the tub drain, this will all come down on her. Do I have confirmation that the popsicle is untraceable? Someone get me Albany on a secured line and where the hell are my visuals? Liz Hawkins is on to us and I'm flying blind here! This is our worst nightmare. Thirty-four years of coordinating efforts, altering traffic patterns, running a fake medical supply company, and even manipulating gravity itself for one purpose — to severely annoy Liz Hawkins — is all about to blow up in our faces. But how? We've been so careful. It doesn't matter now. We need to get Operative "Boss" out of there immediately. Damn it, get him out now! Negative, do not alert his wife and kids. Repeat, family was not part of original mission. You're a clever girl, Liz Hawkins. But how in the hell did you figure it all out? I suppose something this beautiful couldn't last. We were 48,000 agents, single-minded in our purpose of heaping life's petty indignities on Liz Hawkins, each performing flawlessly, right up to the end. It was a Sisyphean ballet of petty cruelty. But we slipped up, and now it's all coming down like a house of cards. It was the wallet. Of course. I'm such a fool. She must have seen that coming from a mile away. We got lazy for one moment and good men are going to pay for it with their lives. Reconnaissance Team, bring the bus driver into headquarters for a debriefing with extreme prejudice. We have a Judas in our midst, and I'm going to smoke him out. This leak goes to the highest levels of our organization. She even knew about the stapler, for Christ's sake. Send in the arson team to the office location. I want that place lit up by 0600 hours. Once cleanup operations have been finalized, we'll initiate Phoenix protocol. We all knew the mission, and we all knew the risks. As soon as the evidence is gone, I will present you each with your cyanide capsule. We have a traitor among us, so I'll take mine last and, as an insurance policy, I have one bullet in the chamber of my revolver. No one gets out. God damn you, Liz Hawkins. You were too smart for us. I only hope the next team fares better. Tell my wife I love her. Liz Hawkins and Commander Dutch Yancy

Melania Trump's Plane Forced To Make Emergency Landing After Smoke Begins Billowing Out Of First Lady
WASHINGTON — In what is being described as a "close call" for the aircraft's passengers and crew, sources reported that Melania Trump's plane was forced to turn around and make an emergency landing Wednesday after thick plumes of smoke began billowing out of the first lady. "There was a strong burning smell, and as soon as we noticed the black smoke venting out of Mrs. Trump's eye sockets and ear canals, we realized something was seriously wrong," said crewmember Anton Chapman, adding that, despite routine maintenance checks of the first lady to prevent such incidents, occasional mishaps could still occur, especially when internal regulating systems malfunctioned. "Smoke started filling the cabin, and several members of the press pool began choking and gagging as we tried to contain the damage. Unfortunately, there was very little we could do before the fumes surrounding Mrs. Trump ignited and she burst into flames. Several staffers were severely impaired in the blast, and we had to make an emergency landing." At press time, witnesses confirmed a crew of firefighters at the landing site was attempting to put out the still-burning first lady.

U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV
WASHINGTON, DC — As the nation approaches the one-year anniversary of the Super Bowl XXXVIII tragedy, an FCC study shows that millions of U.S. children were severely traumatized by the exposure to a partially nude female breast during the Feb. 1, 2004 halftime show. "No one who lived through that day is likely to forget the horror," said noted child therapist Dr. Eli Wasserbaum. "But it was especially hard on the children." The tragic wardrobe malfunction occurred approximately 360 days ago, during Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake's performance of "Rock Your Body," when Timberlake tore Jackson's costume, accidentally revealing her right breast. "By the time CBS cut to an aerial view of the stadium, the damage was done," said Wasserbaum, who has also worked extensively with orphaned and amputee children in Third World war zones. "I've found that children can be amazingly resilient, but this event was too much for many of them to take. The horrible image of that breast is likely to haunt them for the rest of their lives." According to the 500-page report filed by the FCC, more than 90 percent of the children who saw the exposed breast said they were "confused and afraid." "Mommy has dirty chest bumps," said a 5-year-old boy quoted in one of the thousands of case studies compiled by the FCC. "She's like the bad lady on TV. I'm afraid Mommy will take off her shirt and scare everyone. I hate Mommy." Girls were traumatized as well, often expressing apprehensions about sexual development. According to Wasserbaum, one 8-year-old girl told her parents that she didn't "want to get evil breasts." Wasserbaum said children of both genders associate their trauma with footballs, presumably because of the context in which they were exposed to the breast. A great number of children who witnessed the tragedy are still plagued by nightmares of sun-shapes that recall Jackson's nipple ring. Of the infants who saw the breast, 76 percent are unwilling to breast feed or use a bottle, forcing their parents to nourish them intravenously. "When the tragedy took place, we knew it would cause psychological trauma, but we had no idea how long the effects would last," Wasserbaum said." Our worst fears have been confirmed. It will take years to repair the damage." Cases of deviant sexual development induced by breast-glimpsing are widespread amongst older children. Pathologies range from schoolyard exhibitionism to gender-role confusion and violent shirt-tearing. "The FCC imposed the maximum $27,500 penalty on each of the 20 CBS-owned television stations," Wasserbaum said. "But the government offered no recompense to the individuals exposed to the breast. And neither Jackson nor Timberlake has ever specifically apolgized to the children whose lives they ruined, or donated a penny for the adolescents' psychiatric care." Across America, parental concern over the condition doctors have dubbed Nearly Naked Breast Disorder continues to grow. "How can my son Brandon be expected to make it through something like that unscathed?" asked mother of four Shonali Bhomik of the San Francisco-based What About the Children? Foundation, one of many social-awareness groups spearheading the fight for increased NNBD funding in Congress. "For approximately 1.5 seconds, he saw a breast. The image was seared into his innocent, tiny retinas. He can't close his eyes without replaying the whole ugly scene over and over in his little head." "For the love of God — that breast was almost nude," Bhomik added. Bhomik said she has concerns about her son's development. "I shudder to think how this could affect my son once he reaches puberty," Bhomik said. "Little Brandon just wanted to watch the fun halftime show with his family. He was only 10 years old." Bhomik is one of millions of people facing every parent's worst nightmare: that their child will see a partially exposed breast. Wasserbaum said there is no way to predict whether the children will recover. "One thing is certain," Wasserbaum said. "For us as a nation, the horrific consequences of almost-nakedness have only just begun to make themselves apparent." Wasserbaum added that children who saw the televised breast in Europe, Australia, and various other nations throughout the world were somehow unaffected by the sight.

Point/Counterpoint: Gov. Palin Has No Experience vs.
Please Keep Your Voice Down, My Poor Retarded Child Is Sleeping There may be no better word to describe John McCain's vice presidential pick than "ridiculous." After months of criticizing Sen. Obama for his inexperience with foreign policy, McCain has chosen quite possibly the least experienced woman in politics to serve as his second-in-command. How little experience does Palin have, you ask? She was a part-time mayor of a tiny Alaska town and then governor of one of the least populous states in the union for less than two years. Palin has never met with any foreign leaders of any kind — in fact, she only applied for a U.S. passport last year! In this time of international turmoil, how could McCain, a man who would become the oldest candidate ever elected, select a novice like Palin knowing she would be one heartbeat away from having to step into the presidency and protect our nation? The mere notion that Palin is even remotely equipped to manage the ongoing war on terror is an out-and-out fantasy dreamt up by the Republican party to disguise why they really selected her: to attract female and evangelical voters in a desperate attempt to win the election at any cost — even if it means sacrificing our nation's security. McCain has chosen for his running mate a woman who is so set in the past that she supports abstinence-only education despite its failure among her own children; a woman who claims she is not convinced that global warming is a serious issue. Palin has time and again supported needless and ecologically destructive drilling in Alaska's wildlife reserves — drilling that McCain himself is ardently opposed to — yet offers no plan for the very real and proven threat of climate change, despite the danger it poses to her home state. Perhaps the most frightening prospect of putting Palin in the White House is her continued support of the failing war in Iraq — a war she called "a task that is from God." Electing Sarah Palin and John McCain in November will no doubt prolong this costly and unwinnable conflict, which every day claims the lives of more American troops and sinks our country further into debt. Palin is not a bold new choice for America. I have no doubt she will provide the same type of irresponsible and flat-out dangerous leadership we've seen from President Bush for the past eight years. That is, if she provides any leadership at all. Shhhh! Could you please stop tearing apart my record so loudly? I just put my special needs child down for a nap. You remember my poor, Down syndrome baby, don't you? The developmentally disabled child I carried to term despite knowing that he had special needs? The child who would be helpless without my constant care and attention? Well, he's just nodded off, and if you continue to provide such damning evidence of my inexperience in both foreign and domestic policy, you'll wake him. You wouldn't want him to start crying, would you? It's very rude of you to keep pointing out the myriad reasons I am unfit to be the governor of Alaska, much less vice president of the United States of America, when you know my Down syndrome–afflicted son is trying to get some much-needed rest. If you wanted to question my qualifications as a leader, you should have thought of that sooner, like, say, before I gave birth to a retarded child who would probably starve to death if I weren't so selflessly and courageously dedicated to him. Actually, he'll probably be sleeping for a while, so maybe it would be best if you came back later. Perhaps this afternoon, or in a couple of months. It's just that he gets so tired having to struggle with even the simplest tasks that you and I take for granted. Because my special needs son has Down syndrome, you see. My child has Down syndrome. And, as the mother of a baby with Down syndrome, I would appreciate it if you stopped bringing up my nonexistent energy plan while he sleeps there, like an angel. My beautiful, special needs angel. I assure you, I have every intention of responding to your claims. Sarah Palin does not run from a challenge. Like the challenge of raising a child with Down syndrome. That's what I've been doing for five months now, and let me tell you, it is hard work. But I wouldn't trade a moment of it for anything in the world, not even for more time to respond to the gaping holes you've just punched in my candidacy. Did I mention he has Down syndrome? Now, if you'll please back away quietly without saying anything else — especially about my recent comments regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and how they illustrate my complete lack of even a basic understanding of our economy — I'll forget this whole thing ever happened. And so will my vote-stealing retard baby. Roger Hobaugh, Concerned Citizen and Gov. Sarah Palin, Republican Vice Presidential Nominee

John Bolton Urges War Against The Sun After Uncovering Evidence It Has Nuclear Capabilities
WASHINGTON — Amid escalating tensions with the hostile celestial object, National Security Adviser John Bolton argued for military action against the Sun Monday after being presented with evidence it has nuclear capabilities. "Newly collected intelligence shows the Sun, day after day, generating extreme levels of nuclear energy, and America simply cannot stand idly by any longer," said Bolton, adding that the United States will soon be forced to consider a preemptive attack on the Sun, such as deploying troops to the Sun's surface or a targeted strike to swiftly take out the Sun. "We know the Sun is harboring dangerous amounts of nuclear power in what we are referring to as its 'Core,' a site where the Sun appears to be fusing over 600 million metric tons of hydrogen every second. This is, needless to say, an extremely powerful, aggressive star that threatens the American way of life, and, frankly, I question the utility of negotiating with such an unreasonable orb." Bolton added that the United States would likely consider military action after giving the Sun a chance to comply with a nuclear accord.

My Dad Is A Army Guy vs.
I Am A Army Guy My name is Brian but my dad's name is Sgt. Carrelson and he's a Army guy! He has lots of different guns he shoots with his friends in Iraq and they drive tanks too. BOOM BOOM BOOM PCHSSSHTK! VROOMMM! My dad has five different kinds of guns. No seven kinds of guns. He kills bad guys all the time. Like one time he was in the desert and then some bad guys came and he killed them all. When I grow up I want to be a Army guy just like him. But I'll also have lots of knives and be a ninja. Then I'll fight bad guys in Iraq! When my dad went away on the big airplane he said he's coming back soon, and I'm going to see him soon. He said that too when he called on the phone. He told me he's having lots of fun in Iraq. They get to play Xbox and sleep in tents and eat all the junk food they want. I wish I could do that. My dad says they have a Burger King in the Army just like they do here. I love Burger King and chicken tenders are my favorite thing they have there. Sometimes my dad gets to throw grenades. He throws them and then everything explodes, just like in Transformers. KABOOM! All the bad guys are all dead. One of my dad's friends got shot in the body and it was bleeding a lot. And then he got taken away in a helicopter. But then they let him go back really fast and start fighting again. I fell off my dirt bike last week and it hurt really bad, but my mom said to be strong like my dad. Nobody can beat my dad! He's the best! Yup. I'm a Army guy, all right. We are given guns and me and the boys shoot at the bad guys and drive around in our Humvees. PAH-PAH-PAH-PAH-PAH, PCHSSSHTK! I can operate five kinds of guns. As a Army guy, I'm part of the strongest fighting force on earth. Boy, we have a lot of firepower — so much, it's hard to keep track sometimes. Out on patrol a couple days ago, some bad guys tried to pick a fight with us, and we let rip with everything we got. I don't know how many there were, but I do believe we killed every last one of them. I gotta say I wouldn't mind my son growing up to be a Army guy one day. Follow in his dad's footsteps. Hope we're not still in Iraq, though. Of course, I planned to be back home by now. It was eight months, then 12, then 16. They keep telling me I'll be home soon, anyhow. Can't complain too much, because we got most everything you could ever want over here. Air- conditioned tents? Check. Hot Pockets and Red Bull? Yup. Xbox? We got two. They even got a Burger King out here. It doesn't have all the same stuff as a normal one, but you can still get a Whopper, at least. It's nice to have things that remind you of home, since you forget about stuff like that when you're out here bringing the fight, tossing grenades, killing bad guys like everyone's Schwarzenegger. KABLAAAM, you know. But it's been a rough year. We had a guy go down a couple weeks ago, I thought he was dead for sure. Thought we were all dead. But he shows up a few weeks later with a note from the doc saying he's good to go. Told him it's time to get back in the fight because "he's a Army guy, that's what Army guys do. " And we need new guys pretty bad. Hopefully it won't be too long before I get home, see the wife and kid, tear it up on the dirtbikes and all that. I wanna make sure I get as much time with my son as I can, since I still got at least another tour to do. He's the best. Brian Carrelson and Staff Sgt. Keith Carrelson

Romney Slowly Turning Into $100 Bill
TAMPA, FL — Campaign sources expressed concern today over Mitt Romney's green complexion, papery skin, and slowly flattening body frame, prompting increased speculation that the Republican presidential candidate has been gradually transforming into a $100 bill. Staff members said the Republican candidate — whose skin pigmentation has now been fully overtaken by optically variable ink and whose spinal column has slowly shifted into an outline of Philadelphia's Independence Hall — has been undergoing the transformation throughout the campaign and now more closely resembles a banknote than a human being. "When Mitt's skin began changing, everyone was worried he was suffering from some sort of strange health condition," said an anonymous Romney staffer, who went on to describe the loud crinkling noises the candidate now makes whenever he walks, and the potent smell of paper stock that has overwhelmed campaign headquarters since mid-April. "But when one of our aides noticed Benjamin Franklin's head starting to protrude from Gov. Romney's chest, it became clear that he was actually becoming money." "We're not really sure how or why this is happening, and Mitt himself has yet to acknowledge it," the source continued. "With that being said, he has to realize something's wrong. I mean, he clearly has the phrase 'federal reserve note' running straight down his face, for Christ's sake." The first signs of Romney's metamorphosis into the denomination of U.S. currency were reportedly observed during a November 2011 campaign stop in Alexandria, VA, when a mixture of black and green ink begin flowing out of the candidate's nose and ears. Aides said they became worried again later that month after spotting what initially appeared to be large, bold tattoos of serial codes and Timothy Geithner's signature on Romney's arms. Despite his visibly transitioning anatomy and biological structure, Romney has reportedly insisted on maintaining a full schedule of campaign appearances, already leading to numerous incidents in which the .0043-inch-thick candidate has been blown down the street or across the room by strong gusts of wind or ceiling fans. "I went to one of Gov. Romney's rallies last month, and when I tried shaking his hand, his whole arm just crumpled right there in my palm," said Boulder, CO resident and registered Republican Chris Stockwell. "I apologized, but he just kept smiling and told me not to worry about it. Then an aide came over and smoothed out the wrinkles, and Romney just continued making his way through the crowd." "The governor definitely looked like a $100 bill, though," Stockwell added. "And a brand-new, crisp one, too." While Romney's transformation has been met with confusion from the nation's medical community, many conservative pundits argue the candidate's transition into a living, breathing unit of currency only increases his viability as a political leader. "Gov. Romney is a businessman. That is how Americans have gotten to know him, and that is how they will primarily connect with him," said Collin Levy, a Wall Street Journal senior editorial writer. "The fact of the matter is, the economy is the most important issue in this election, so who better to lead the country in these difficult times than a $100 bill?" Addressing a crowd of supporters in Florida last Saturday, Romney briefly hinted at his physical condition and its impact on his campaign. "I want all my supporters to know that no matter how I look, no matter how I change, I am still the right leader for this country," said a fully green Romney, speaking to applauding supporters as black ink spewed from his mouth. "I promise you we will take back America and make it great again!" Shortly after leaving the stage, Romney reportedly paused briefly after catching his own reflection in a nearby mirror and quietly said, "Looking good."

'I'll Have To Obstruct One Last Thing,' Whispers Jared Kushner Before Wrapping Gloved Hands Around Mueller's Neck
WASHINGTON — Appearing to have become unhinged during recent questioning, White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner reportedly whispered Tuesday, "I'll have to obstruct one last thing," before wrapping his gloved hands around special counsel Robert Mueller's neck. "You want to talk about my security clearance? This is my security clearance," said Kushner while he slowly strangled the former FBI director who had been conducting an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election with possible collusion from the Trump campaign. "You wanna tell me what I left off my SF-86 form now, Mr. Mueller, do you? Maybe you want to talk more Russian sanctions. Is this candid enough for you? I got your backchannel right here." At press time, Kushner had reportedly started sobbing after jamming a finger on Mueller's throat.

Mom Just Called To Make Sure You're Not Under That Dangling Crane
BOISE, ID — Calling to check on him for the fourth consecutive morning amid reports of the dangers posed by Hurricane Sandy, local mom Mary Canfield expressed relief Tuesday after learning her son in New York wasn't underneath that crane that's dangling from a high-rise apartment building in Manhattan. "Oh, thank God — the thought of you standing under that big, dangling crane was just awful," said the concerned mother, explaining that as soon as she saw TV footage of the crane on 57th Street in Midtown, she had a "horrible vision" of her son, a 27-year-old Brooklyn resident, trapped beneath the twisted wreckage of the crane as floodwaters rose around him. "They're saying it's 1,000 feet up in the air and just flapping around waiting to fall. Honey, promise you won't go near that crane, okay?" Canfield added that in case of an emergency, her son should feel free to call her friend Debbie up in Utica.

Kushner Frantically Searching Desk Drawer For Bold Solutions To Today's Most Pressing Issues
WASHINGTON — Cursing under his breath as he dug through the assorted documents and folders, Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner was frantically searching a desk drawer Wednesday for bold solutions to today's most pressing issues. "I could have sworn I put my trailblazing approaches to ushering in a new era of prosperity in here somewhere," said Kushner as he pulled out random sheets of paper and quickly scanned them in hopes some might contain his strategy for bringing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a swift, peaceful conclusion or his innovative approach to battling the nation's opioid epidemic. "Come on, come on. I just saw my visionary infrastructure plan that would create jobs for millions of Americans like a week ago — maybe it's in the car? Couldn't hurt to look there at this point." At press time, Kushner was still unable to locate his notes for dissuading his father-in-law from taking such a soft stance toward neo-Nazism but ultimately decided he wasn't too excited about that project anyway.

Kim Jong-Un Thrown Into Labor Camp For Attempting To Cross Border Into South Korea
PYONGYANG — Following a swift capture, arrest, and trial before an official tribunal, North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un was thrown into a remote labor camp for attempting to cross the border into South Korea, authorities from the totalitarian nation confirmed Friday. "Kim Jong-un is an enemy of the state and has been sentenced to 45 years of hard labor," said a representative from the North Korean Ministry of People's Security, adding that troops quickly apprehended the former dictator after he and several companions were spotted traveling across the line demarcating the demilitarized zone that divides the two nations in broad daylight. "As punishment for disobeying the government's orders, Kim Jong-un will be forced to work 16 hours a day to repent for his treacherous actions against his nation. May he serve as an example to all North Koreans of the importance of loyalty to one's country." At press time, sources confirmed that the malnourished, tortured former leader had been executed in the camp for collapsing from exhaustion.

Bored Kim Jong-Un Stacks Entire North Korean Populace Into Human Pyramid To Kill Time
PYONGYANG — In an effort to relieve his boredom and fill an otherwise uneventful afternoon, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un stacked all 24 million of his country's inhabitants into a human pyramid Friday to help him pass the time. "Do the pyramid faster and taller," the North Korean dictator ordered from a balcony overlooking Kim Il-sung Square, as 800,000 of his citizens clambered to reach the 47th tier of the massive gymnastic formation and steady themselves on the trembling backs of millions more of their countrymen. "I want it taller than that. Have the labor camps been emptied? We can add prisoners from the labor camps. Move faster! Ugh, this human pyramid is more dull than no human pyramid at all." At press time, Kim had left to take a nap, but ordered the pyramid to remain indefinitely in case he got bored again and wanted to play around with it some other time.

TLC Producer Wants List Of 100 Fucked-Up Families On Desk By End Of Day
SILVER SPRING, MD — Saying that he didn't "give two shits" if they had to knock on the door of every trailer and halfway house in the country, TLC producer and programming director Mark Livingston reportedly told his staffers Friday that he expects to see a list of at least 100 fucked-up families on his desk by the end of the workday. "We're up shit creek right now, so I need each one of you assholes rooting through every gutter in the goddamn Ozarks to find me a household of inbreds, addicts, or fat-as-fuck morons that we can put in primetime," a visibly aggravated Livingston said to his staff following the cancellation of the network's popular Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, stressing that the new families had better be "borderline brain-dead" and "messed up as all fuck." "If they have 20 dipshit kids, that's great. If they only have one greasy dimwit kid who can barely string a sentence together, that'll work too. Hell, you get me some snarl-toothed family of backwoods idiots who all call their dad Papa Pig or some shit like that, and I'll sign them immediately. Just find me some family of sewer people I can throw in front of the goddamn camera, got it?" At press time, Livingston was angrily telling his staffers that they could all find a new job wiping asses at the Disney Channel if they brought him one more suggestion for a morbidly obese teen mother.

Rape Investigation Finds Star College Quarterback Has Got The Goods
'He Can Make All The Throws And Has A Cannon For An Arm,' Confirms Sexual Assault Inquiry ROANOKE, VA — Following a full investigation into allegations of sexual assault at an on-campus dormitory, the Roanoke County Police Department announced Thursday that a star Virginia Methodist University football player accused of rape has definitely got the goods to be an elite NFL quarterback. "Our investigation focused on a single male rape suspect, who, at 6'3" and 225 pounds, possesses the ideal frame to stand tall in the pocket and deliver an absolute strike," Chief of Police Joseph Lumpkin told reporters at a press conference, adding that, after interviewing multiple eyewitnesses and evaluating all of the physical evidence, it was indisputable to detectives that the All-American gunslinger has ice water running through his veins and is capable of putting the ball where only his receiver can get it. "After piecing together all of the available information, we can now confidently say that the suspect isn't afraid to take a hit while waiting to air out the deep ball, and all the facts are conclusive in showing that he does indeed have the quickest delivery in the conference. This young man is, without a doubt, the one who can put his team on his back and take them all the way." Lumpkin confirmed that his department will immediately turn its findings over to the district attorney, who is expected to be considerably impressed by the suspect's ability to make plays with his feet in the face of blitzing pass rushers.

North Korean Populace Already Mentally Preparing For Whatever Insane Bullshit They'll Have To Do For Kim Jong-Un Funeral
PYONGYANG — Saying they were taking a deep breath and steeling themselves for the melodramatic public wailing and mass-scale processions they might soon have to engage in, sources confirmed Monday that the people of North Korea were already mentally preparing for whatever insane bullshit they will be made to do for Kim Jong-un's state funeral. "Now that Dear Leader hasn't been seen in 40 days, I guess it's probably time to start getting myself ready to circle in lockstep with thousands of others around a 50-foot bronze bust of him for several hours while crying his name in anguish, or something like that," said Pyongyang resident Bahn Lee, echoing the sentiments of his 25 million countrymen, all of whom were reportedly bracing themselves for the possibility of being forced to tear at their clothing, theatrically fall to their knees, and then be supported by bystanders as they each took their turn walking past Kim's glass casket. "I just have to get into the right state of mind now for when I'm called on to stand motionless in the cold holding a banner bearing the Supreme Leader's face while sorrowfully chanting his virtues in unison with thousands of others. Yeah, I think I can handle that kind of stuff for the official three-year mourning period." At press time, the nation's populace was trying to mentally work themselves up to don their official mourning jumpsuits and participate in a countrywide somber dance routine.

Group Of Fifth-Grade Boys Discover Pile Of Naked Ladies Discarded In Woods
FREEPORT, ME — Excitedly pushing past each other as they gathered around the slightly soggy pile, a group of overjoyed local fifth-graders came across several perfectly good naked ladies lying right in the woods behind the baseball field, sources confirmed Tuesday. "Whoa! Look at all of them — you can see everything!" said wide-eyed 11-year-old Joshua Goldstein as he knelt down to closely inspect each one of the fully nude young women lying in a haphazard heap on the ground, before turning his attention to a large-breasted one left draped over a log. "Sure, they're a little dirty, and a couple of them look like they're from the '70s, but after we dry them off they'll be perfect. They're still in pretty good shape! Who would just leave them lying out here like this?" After concluding that their mothers might discover the nude women if they brought them home, the boys reportedly decided to tuck the naked ladies under some bushes and come back to look at them later.

Wistful Kim Jong-Un Stumbles Onto Childhood Drawings He Made Of Nuclear Attacks On West
PYONGYANG — Experiencing a deep sense of nostalgia while sifting through the stack of old papers, North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un reportedly stumbled onto childhood drawings Monday that he had made of nuclear attacks on the West. "Gosh, time really flies, but I can still clearly remember drawing these pictures of an all-out nuclear strike on the West when I was in kindergarten," said the wistful Kim, chuckling at the crudely rendered crayon depiction of several nuclear missiles flying toward what appeared to be the landmass of North America. "These nukes are about half the size of the United States, and there's definitely not enough mushroom clouds. I used to entertain myself for hours by drawing bombs destroying American cities. Aw, I love this one where all the little stick-figure people are screaming." At press time, North Korea's state-run media was circulating the childhood drawings as proof of their Dear Leader's prescience.

New X-Men Film Features Bryan Singer Traveling Back In Time To Molest Younger Self
LOS ANGELES — Early reviews confirmed Thursday that X-Men: Days Of Future Past, the latest installment in the popular superhero film series, prominently features a storyline in which director Bryan Singer journeys through a portal in the space-time continuum to an earlier era, where he coerces his 16-year-old self into sexual intercourse. "Hey, I work in movies — you have any interest in Hollywood?" the director reportedly says in the film, caressing his teenage self's shoulder in a scene preceded by a montage that includes Singer frantically searching for a coke dealer on the Lower East Side and attempting to contact older studio executives for a "wild party" later that night. "There's going to be a little get-together in my hotel room at the Ritz later on. Tons of kids like you will be there, and a few showbiz bigwigs. Let me tell you, with a face like that, I can make big things happen for you. I really mean it." Several reports indicated that the latter portion of the movie's plotline focuses on Singer locked in a pulse-pounding race against time to prevent his adolescent self from filing sexual assault charges and destroying his career.

The Onion's Person Of The Year 2014
(TIE) Malala Yousafzai And John Cena When The Onion's editorial board convened to determine its Person of the Year for 2014, the members of our selection committee were in agreement that identifying the individual most worthy of this distinguished honor would be no easy task. Indeed, when faced with reducing hundreds of esteemed innovators, philanthropists, and thought leaders to a single deserving recipient, the selection committee ultimately proved unable to choose just one man or woman who most embodies the values of integrity, benevolence, and courage that define this most prestigious of accolades. Thus, following weeks of impassioned debate, The Onion is proud to present, for the first time ever, the two co-winners of our Person of the Year award: Pakistani human rights advocate Malala Yousafzai and 12-time WWE champion John Cena. Over the course of the last year, who could be said to have accomplished more and had a greater impact on the world than these two? Yousafzai: an impassioned defender of women's rights who has risked her life to campaign for equal education opportunities for girls. Cena: a physically dominant strongman and submission specialist who has ascended to the top of the professional wrestling world through his combination of charisma, athleticism, and devastating finishing moves, such as the "Attitude Adjustment" and the "STFU." Truly, no two more outstanding or inspirational figures could be said to exist. Of course, though equals in the eyes of The Onion, Yousafzai and Cena took markedly different paths to this year's honor. Yousafzai survived a vicious assassination attempt by a Taliban gunman, battling the odds to surmount her near-fatal injuries and emerging more dedicated than ever to advancing the ideals of equality and freedom. Much as Cena inspires countless millions of wrestling fans across the so-called Cenation, Yousafzai inspires young girls around the globe, even in spite of constant death threats, and earlier this year made history by becoming, at only age 17, the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. No less remarkable are the accomplishments of Cena, whose work inside the ring has rightfully earned him praise and respect the world over. Just as Yousafzai survived an assassin's bullets, the fearless WrestleMania headliner has endured hundreds, if not thousands of suplexes, backbreakers, and steel chair blows to the head, and yet has refused to submit to a three count time and time again. And like the Pakistani activist, Cena also proved his bravery, standing tall in the face of a range of foes every bit as vicious as the Taliban, including Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, and Kane. And though Cena's list of victories is long and illustrious, perhaps no occasion was more heartening than his heroism at this year's Money In The Bank pay-per-view, in which he improbably won the main event ladder match to secure the WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt, a celebrated prize rivaled only by the Nobel committee's offering. As stated, the voting process for this year's award was competitive and impassioned. Faced with two icons of seemingly equal merit — Malala Yousafzai and John Cena — our panel was unable to decide which one was more deserving of our highest honor. Cena or Yousafzai? Just the fourth wrestler in history to win multiple Royal Rumble matches or a relentless crusader for equality and progress? Some choices cannot be made. And though Cena technically won by a handful of votes, the selection committee ultimately determined that to place one above the other would be a disservice to them, to their legacies, and to you, the reader. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that The Onion presents our Person of the Year award to both humanitarian Malala Yousafzai and wrestler, actor, and rapper John Cena, two sources of inspiration to a world in desperate need of heroes.

Ferguson Decision Reaffirms Right Of Police To Use Deadly Force When They Feel Sufficiently Inclined
WASHINGTON — Following a legal precedent established over the course of decades, the St. Louis County grand jury decision Monday to not indict officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of an unarmed teen reportedly reaffirmed the right of police to use deadly force whenever they feel sufficiently inclined. "The outcome of this grand jury investigation further supports a police officer's right to shoot to kill if, and only if, he feels absolutely willing to do so and it suits his purposes," said Georgetown law professor Adrienne Hoffman, adding that reasonable suspicion to use lethal force is 100 percent optional when an officer fires on a suspect, regardless of circumstances. "This decision makes it completely clear that, when confronted in the line of duty, police are legally justified in using extreme force against a suspect whenever they need to or just feel like it." Hoffman added that the decision further asserts an officer's right to claim self-defense against anyone within range of his weapon.

Father Showing Kids 'Field Of Dreams' For First Time Unaware Kevin Costner Sparking Son's Sexual Awakening
WILKES-BARRE, PA — Oblivious to the intense feelings of arousal coursing through the pre-adolescent's body, local man Pete Strahl reportedly introduced his children to the film Field Of Dreams Monday evening, not knowing that its male lead, played by Kevin Costner, was sparking his son's sexual awakening. "This is an absolute classic — a real man's movie," said Strahl, handing his 10-year-old a bowl of popcorn as the film's opening sequence, in which the sweat-drenched protagonist carries a heavy wood-handled hoe through rows of corn, unleashed a string of thoughts and urges in the child's mind that he had never felt in his life and doesn't quite understand yet. "The scene at the end always gives me chills. I hope you like it as much as I do." After the movie was over, Strahl's son reportedly went up to his bedroom and hesitantly typed the words "Costner in baseball uniform" into Google Images while struggling to grasp what was happening to him.

New Fitness Tracker Monitors Amount Of Exercise Users Watch On TV
SAN FRANCISCO — Hailing the product as a huge step forward in health monitor technology, representatives from Fitbit held a product-reveal event today at which shareholders were shown a new fitness tracker capable of monitoring the amount of exercise the wearer watches on television. "Using the latest in optical nerve monitoring, the Fitbit Tele-View Alta allows users to set and achieve goals for watching televised activity of all types," said Fitbit CEO James Park, emphasizing how the Tele-View Alta allows users to track activity from commercials, sports games, and training montages, making special mention of a feature enabling the device to remind the user to turn on the television if a significant interval had passed since the wearer saw a character stand or stretch. "I think our user community will be pleasantly surprised at how much exercise they watch, whether they're catching a passing glance of a character walking on TV in a store window display or watching a home improvement host climb stairs while they're at the dentist. As long as they avoid watching sedentary characters or seeing themselves in the mirror, they'll hit their exercise-watching goal well before their viewing binge is over." Early beta testers of the new Tele-View Alta have already figured out how to cheat the system by leaving the tracker in front of the TV while they sleep.

Jimmy Carter Already Back To Elite Sumo Wrestling Circuit After Recovering From Hip Surgery
TOKYO — Triumphantly pounding his chest as he slammed his feet down in the ring for the first time in weeks, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter was reportedly back on the elite sumo wrestling circuit Monday, despite have undergone hip surgery less than a month ago. "It was tough for Jimmy to be away from the sport this long, so it's been a huge relief to see him recover from his injury and get back into fighting form," said Carter's trainer, Daisuke Watanabe, expressing surprise at just how quickly the 94-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner was able to throw his opponent out of the ring and improve his rank from sekiwake to ōzeki. "I know it hasn't been easy for him to resume his old routine of strength training and consuming 20,000 calories per day, but he's made absolutely remarkable progress. The fact that he's getting used to a new prosthetic hip and can still muster the power to lift his opponent in the air and toss him off the dohyō is nothing short of amazing. It couldn't have come at a better time, either, because the sport was really missing a lot in his absence." After winning his match, sources reported the 39th president was seen lounging shirtless in the locker room sauna, sweating it out with several of his 500-pound rivals.

Over 417,000 Hours Of Private Presidential Conversations Discovered After No One Remembered To Turn Off Richard Nixon's Tape Recorder
WASHINGTON — Baffled as to how the potentially disastrous mistake could have gone unnoticed for so many years, White House sources confirmed Friday that roughly 417,225 hours of private presidential conversations were discovered immaculately preserved due to the fact that no one remembered to turn off Richard Nixon's tape recorder. "Uh oh — it turns out that every single word that has been uttered in the Oval Office since the early 1970s has been perfectly recorded on this hidden device. This could be pretty bad," said a Trump administration official who wished to remain anonymous, revealing that aides had stumbled upon the tapes earlier this week and, after discovering they contained thousands of clearly recorded conversations over the course of the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Trump presidencies, had been unsure how to proceed in handling a find of such magnitude. "I'm not sure the American public could handle some of the information these tapes contain. There's key information that could clarify the Iran–Contra scandal, countless conversations about the war in Iraq — there's even a meeting where George W. Bush and Dick Cheney discuss 9/11 almost a month before it happened. This is going to have huge repercussions." At press time, sources reported that the panicked aides had, in a botched attempt to delete the recording, accidentally begun to play on a loop the audio of a 1981 Oval Office meeting in which Vice President George H.W. Bush hires John Hinckley Jr. to assassinate president Ronald Reagan.

After Much Thought, OGN Has Decided To Update Our Review Of 'Banjo-Kazooie' From A 9.7 To A 9.6
At Onion Gamers Network, we always strive to provide the pinnacle in gaming news, commentary, previews, and reviews. On rare occasions, however, we have failed to live up to these lofty standards and must take significant steps to correct these missteps. Today, we find ourselves needing to do just that. After a thorough analysis by our 50-person editorial board, we are officially updating our 1998 review of Rare's Banjo-Kazooie from a 9.7 to a 9.6. This is not a decision we made lightly. Allow us to explain our thought process: Without question, Banjo-Kazooie remains a classic example of the golden era of 3D platformers. Indeed, we remain steadfast in our belief that the developer's extensive attention to detail makes collecting jiggies in the game's colorful world a "uniquely exhilarating and adorable experience." Nonetheless, our initial review overlooked several issues that can no longer justify the score of 9.7, indicating near-gaming perfection. At the time, we were perhaps affected by the significant hype surrounding Banjo-Kazooie's release, never pausing to factor in the game's less-than-stellar replayability and occasional graphical glitches. This, in conjunction with the game's now-apparent overreliance on borrowed concepts from Mario 64, and our staff's consensus that the game's plot — centered around rescuing Banjo's sister, Tooty, from the evil witch Gruntilda — was merely "excellent" instead of "extraordinary," have led us to issue an official retraction of our original score and update it with a more thoroughly considered and accurate 9.6. We apologize to any readers led astray by our initial ranking. Frankly, we cannot repair the damage caused by this error, but we dearly hope our updated review can at least set the record straight for posterity, helping anyone who has yet to play the title, which we'd like to emphasize is still a highly immersive platforming experience. However, in order to properly make amends, we have fired the original reviewer, a 33-year veteran of the company, as well as the copy editor and three other editorial staffers involved in the publication of this woefully misleading article. To anyone who played the game in 1998 and had a nagging sense that what they were experiencing wasn't quite "truly next-level gaming" when they were led to believe it was, know only that Onion Gamers Network is profoundly sorry. We hope that our updated grade more accurately reflects the level of merit that Banjo-Kazooie has earned. Our rating of the game's sequel, Banjo-Tooie, however, remains unchanged at a 5.1.

So-Called Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Looks Nothing Like Him
SIMI VALLEY, CA — Declaring the whole visit "sort of a letdown," Valley View Middle School student Lucas Hursch, 13, was disappointed to find Monday that the so-called Ronald Reagan Presidential Library bears no resemblance to the man who was the leader of the free world from 1980 to 1988. "You could maybe argue it has a passing resemblance from some angles, but seriously, that would be quite a stretch," said the eighth-grader, adding that unless the 40th president had a tiny, marble version of himself inside his own body which he charged a $20 entrance fee to see, the building bearing his name shares no physical characteristics to the actor-turned-politician. "I assumed we'd get there, enter a giant glass and steel model of Reagan's head, perhaps using The Great Communicator's tongue as a walkway, and have the chance to explore his guts and stuff. But this place has none of that — just a boring building with completely normal doors and windows. I was taught a library is where knowledge is kept, so that kind of should be up in his brain, I guess? Also, you'd think they have it dressed up in a nice suit or something, but the outside is just bricks. If they were going for realism, they did not do a great job." Hursch noted that the architects and building contractors had no excuse for their shoddy work, as there are thousands of photographs available to aid them in constructing a more realistic replica of the president.

Obamas Sign Exclusive 6-Truck Deal To Produce Series Of Mid-Size RAM Pickups
AUBURN HILLS, MI — Touting their excitement over the rare opportunity to offer a motor vehicle developed with the signature sense of style of a former leader of the free world, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles of North America announced Tuesday that Barack and Michelle Obama have signed a multimillion-dollar six-truck contract to produce a series of mid-size RAM pickups. "For the 2021 model year, we will roll out a new series of medium-platform RAM trucks in six trim levels, all with clean-sheet designs masterminded by the Obama family, continuing the legacy of the former POTUS and FLOTUS of inspiring Americans through unparalleled power, smooth handling, and class-leading comfort," said RAM chief of design Joseph Dehner, noting that the trucks would be available in variants from the youth/sport-oriented Malia base model to the luxury Audacity flagship. "The Obama family still has a lot to say about American life, particularly where legroom, wireless device charging, and towing capabilities are concerned, and they were proud to lend their unique voices to RAM's design vocabulary, as well as to our navigation systems as an added-cost option. With the former first family at the wheel, the new RAM can't help but bridge the divide between America's aspiring luxury buyers and economy-minded consumers." While little else is known concerning the Obama-designed truck, sources at RAM confirmed that power will be provided by Chrysler's dependable 3.6-liter V-6 engine, pricing will start around $35,000, and styling will include signature red, white, blue, and limited-edition tan colorways.

MIT Researchers Make Breakthrough On Marionette Strings That Allow Paralyzed Man To Walk
CAMBRIDGE, MA — Hailing the discovery as one that would undoubtedly change the medical field forever, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced Thursday that they had made a breakthrough on marionette strings that had allowed a paralyzed man to walk. "While our subject had incurred severe damage to his spinal cord, doctors were successfully able to attach long strings on his arms and legs to a large, suspended wooden cross and restore motion to all of his limbs," said lead researcher Ken MacQuoid, adding that the team spent years building an apparatus that would allow appendage movement while also keeping the marionette strings from getting tangled. "Just a few months ago, this man couldn't even lift one hand, but now, he can dangle from the ceiling while his entire body moves back and forth. Soon, with both more time and practice, we hope he will also be able to clap his hands, dance, and even do a backflip." At press time, MIT had reportedly been forced to shut the project down after it was revealed that a member of the team had previously assisted the man's movement by inserting their hand into his rectum.

Tiny, Rejuvenated Jimmy Carter Emerges From Pile Of Ashes After Aged Ex-President Bursts Into Flames
ATLANTA — Rising triumphantly from a sudden swirl of golden light that had consumed his former ailing body, a tiny, rejuvenated President Jimmy Carter emerged from a pile of ashes Tuesday after the aged ex-president's past incarnation burst into flames. "Behold! I am born anew!" the 6-inch-tall former president proclaimed in a high-pitched voice, raising his minuscule, youthful hands in exultation from the glowing embers as he announced that his appearance heralded "a new dawn" in affordable housing, peacekeeping, and guinea worm eradication. "From these restoring flames, I shall usher in an eternal age of peacekeeping and independence from foreign oil markets. So has it been for the past century-long cycle of Jimmy Carterdom, and so shall it be for all time." At press time, the miniature 39th president's decree had been cut short after an enormous rabbit abruptly emerged from a nearby forest and dragged the squealing reborn world leader into a burrow.

Being A Senator Means Making Tough Decisions That Aren't Always Popular, Smart, Politically Viable, Or Beneficial To Your Constituents
When Lindsey Graham and I released our healthcare bill earlier this month, we knew it would elicit a full-throated response. Citizens across this country are deeply concerned about such an important issue, and these days, you simply can't talk about healthcare without stirring passionate emotions on either side. However, I want to make one thing clear: I will continue to stand strong in the face of any and all criticism of our legislation, because being a U.S. senator means making the tough decisions that aren't always going to be popular, intelligent, politically viable, or beneficial to your constituents in any way whatsoever. I've been in Congress since 2009 and a senator since 2015, and if there's one fundamental truth I've learned about Washington politics, it's that there are going to be times when your position on an issue won't please everyone around you or is spectacularly incompetent or would objectively harm hundreds of thousands of people in your home state alone — and you just have to be okay with that. I know that I am. Some things just come with the territory as an elected official. I knew that sponsoring this legislation would invite my share of critics and, believe me, I knew exactly what they were going to say. The detractors came out swinging right away, arguing that this bill wouldn't make me well-liked, that it isn't a "safe bet" politically, that it was crafted with profound ignorance and staggering callousness, that it's a looming disaster for millions of families and one of the nation's largest industries, and that it will unquestionably, within weeks of its passage, cause horrific physical and financial suffering on a mass scale across this nation. But ultimately, I know I just have to tune out all that noise and go with my gut. Look, I'm fully aware this bill isn't going to win me any popularity contests. But as an elected representative of the people, any decision you truly stand behind — no matter how much it's disliked by the establishment or how lethal it is to American men, women, and children — is one you have to stake your name on. That's why I'm not going to roll over on this issue just because I hear some naysayers here or there, or because a significant number of the people who voted me into office will die at the hands of my decision, or because anyone with a conscience will never respect me again for championing such an ethically bankrupt and financially cataclysmic bill that will destabilize one-sixth of our economy. I live by my principles, and I'm not going to do something just because it would make me friends on Capitol Hill, or because it's sensible, or because it's fiscally prudent, or because it would actually be helpful to the people of this country. I want everyone in Washington and around the country to know that I will not cave to what's smart, practical, and resoundingly favored just to score some cheap political points. You don't put an Obamacare repeal-and-replacement bill like this forward because it's the popular thing to do — you do it because you believe with the very core of your being in an unwanted, preposterous, unfathomably cruel, politically toxic idea that analysis after analysis has determined will send vast swaths of low- and middle-income America to an early grave. Period. So when I cast my vote in the senate chamber, you can rest assured that I will not allow myself to be fazed in any way by what the doubters, the TV anchors, nearly every expert in the country, the Congressional Budget Office, the people I represent in Louisiana, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Cancer Society, the AARP, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente, the National Health Council, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Liver Association, most available research, and virtually all healthcare providers are saying about this bill. I'll just listen to my heart. Because at the end of the day, I'm not here to make decisions that people will like, or respect, or that make sense, or to help anyone. That's just not me. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA)

Incredibly Popular George H.W. Bush Funeral Gets Extended 2-Week Run
WASHINGTON — Declaring that the mourning period for the recently deceased 41st president was "just getting started," a spokesperson announced Thursday that the incredibly popular George H.W. Bush funeral would go on an extended two-week run. "Based on the outpouring of support we've seen for a president who the public views as representing a more respectable era of American politics, we've decided to bring the nationally renowned George H.W. Bush funeral experience to 12 more cities across the country over the rest of the month," said Jim McGrath, spokesman for the late president, adding that "Thousand Points Of Light: George H.W. Bush In Memoriam" was slated for three nights in Texas before returning to Washington, D.C. for an encore funeral, and then the president's casket would be loaded into a newly commissioned Boeing 747 for his "final resting flight" that would barnstorm across the country, including three sold-out nights at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. "Besides the president's casket, accompanied as always by Sully the service dog, we've got a star-studded lineup of eulogists, including Jeb Bush, President Bill Clinton, Vice President Dan Quayle, several of the late president's grandchildren, and on the funeral tour's Christmas special at the All Saints' Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills, President George W. Bush will host a never-before-seen photo montage of the 41st commander-in-chief's life. For those who can't make it to see the deceased president in person, don't worry — it will be broadcast around the clock on ABC, NBC, and CNN, plus live-blogged on The New York Times in its new Salute To 41 vertical, so the nation has several chances to say an extended goodbye to the beloved president one last time. This is truly the patriotic mourning event of the decade, and it is not to be missed." At press time, the late president's spokespeople announced that due to its popularity, "Thousand Points Of Light: George H.W. Bush In Memoriam" had added a year-long residency in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand.

Secret Service Opens Fire On Section Of Slippery Floor That Attempted To Take Out President Carter
PLAINS, GA — Responding with deadly force to a threat that left the 39th president of the United States in the hospital, Secret Service agents confirmed they opened fire Monday evening on an expanse of slippery flooring that had made an attempt on the life of Jimmy Carter in his own home. "It's unclear how a hostile patch of slick tile managed to get so close to President Carter, but upon identifying the wet spot that caused him to fall, we immediately began shooting," said agent Joseph Pena, who according to federal officials put his own safety on the line, heroically throwing himself atop what appeared to be a juice spill to prevent it from doing any more harm to the 95-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner. "In the heat of the altercation, there were unfortunately some casualties, with an innocent table lamp lost after taking friendly fire. We are proud to report, however, that the tile that wounded President Carter has been permanently neutralized and no longer poses any danger." In response to the incident, the Secret Service has reportedly added personnel to Carter's security detail, assigning separate agents to individually patrol every surface of the former president's home.

Pros And Cons Of Facial Recognition Technology
Facial recognition technology has risen in use in various sectors, but its critics argue that it's being implemented without sufficient consideration of its potential consequences. The Onion breaks down the pros and cons of facial recognition technology. Always feels nice to be recognized. Pretty discreet as far as grotesque violations of civil liberties go. Slightly easier than typing "1234" into your phone. You look cute today! It might not be you, but at least it's making somebody a lot of money. Lacks personal touch of having picture tacked up behind bodega counter. Threatens jobs of humans who recognize faces for a living. Getting caught. Identical twins too powerful as it is. No more decades-long cat-and-mouse rivalries between detectives and the criminal geniuses they can't help but respect.

New Evidence Suggests President George Washington Sent Woodcut Of Penis To Secretary
PHILADELPHIA — Saying the discovery shed new light on the father of our country, a team of University of Pennsylvania archivists announced Monday that new evidence suggests George Washington sent a woodcut of his penis to his secretary. "After uncovering a well-preserved, remarkably graphic woodcut dating from the American revolutionary period, and establishing the provenance of both the woodcut and the image from such contemporaneous descriptions as exist, we believe we have conclusive proof that this image is indeed of President Washington's erect penis and was in fact sent to Tobiana Lear, Washington's personal secretary," lead researcher Joyce Carrick said of the block print, which was discovered in the National Archives late last year tucked into a secretary's desk drawer along with a note outlining her presence in the first president's lewd sexual fantasies. "We suspect this was not the only woodcut, as many other printing blocks depicting what we now know to be Washington's penis carved at different angles and shadings have also been found. It even appears that after the original woodcut was not met with a response, several oil portraits of his genitals were couriered to the secretary's home." Carrick's team also discovered the official complaint that Tobiana Lear submitted to Congress concerning the suggestive woodcut, as well as the corresponding Presidential order immediately terminating Lear from her position and deporting her to England.

Gregg Popovich Invites Tim Duncan To Address Team USA On Dangers Of Hypernationalism
SHANGHAI, CHINA — In an effort to prevent players from falling into a tribalistic mindset, head coach Gregg Popovich invited Tim Duncan Wednesday to address Team USA on the dangers of hypernationalism. "We've been hitting the fundamentals of colonialism pretty hard in practice, but I think Tim brings a unique player's perspective on how phony rivalries between nations can be used to pit working people against each other," said Popovich, explaining that Duncan's previous experience playing for Team USA was a perfect example of striving for excellence without dividing people or diminishing outside voices. "This is a young team, so I think they'll benefit from having a veteran like Duncan showing them how single-minded identification with your country can have dangerous consequences both at home and abroad. We have to respect all cultures, whether they're playing zone or man-to-man defense. We're here to prepare for the Olympics next year, not to spread imperialist propaganda." At press time, a visibly frustrated Popovich forced the team to watch the documentary Ataturk after they narrowly avoided an overtime loss to Turkey.

Investigators Trace Cause Of Notre Dame Fire To Cathedral's Outdated 12th-Century Electrical System
PARIS — Saying the devastation could perhaps have been avoided with some routine upgrades to modern 200-amp service, investigators announced Wednesday they have traced the cause of the Notre Dame fire to the cathedral's archaic electrical system, which dates back to the 12th century. "In our examination of the wreckage, we discovered that some of the circuit breakers and sockets hadn't been updated since the reign of Louis XII," said lead investigator Jean-Luc Marchand, explaining that many of the fuses from the time of the cathedral's construction were made of solid oak, while much of the wiring consisted of twisted cords of straw. "The light bulbs we found were so incredibly antiquated that their filaments were made of wool strips dipped in kerosene or whale oil. To make matters worse, Notre Dame's entire electrical system was hooked into the power company's transformer on the pole outside with a single strand of hemp twine. It's a miracle the damage wasn't worse." Marchand went on to add that the fire likely started due to a malfunction from one of the rectory's 14th-century wicker space heaters.

Paris Vows To Rebuild Notre Dame Despite Cosmic Absurdity Of Seeking Inherent Meaning In Fleeting Creations Of Man
PARIS — Following a massive fire that destroyed significant portions of the Catholic cathedral, Paris officials vowed Tuesday to rebuild Notre Dame despite the cosmic absurdity of seeking inherent meaning in the fleeting creations of man. "We will come together as a nation to reconstruct Notre Dame, no matter the fundamental irrationality of imbuing mere man-made structures of stone and wood with any sort of deeper meaning in an existence where entropy is the only universal truth," said French president Emmanuel Macron in a press conference, adding that the government had already received more than $700 million in pledged funding for a restoration project that will "serve as but a momentary impediment to the corrosive sands of time." "Notre Dame was built, destroyed, and rebuilt over the course of hundreds of years, and we will rebuild it again, only to watch it decay once more, for indeed that is its fate, as it is the fate of all of man's works. Like Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the mountain, we will endeavor to fix the cathedral despite all empirical evidence to the contrary, in a world which demonstrates time and time again that there is nothing real to be found in worshipping the ersatz edifices that serve as a sorry facsimile of any real human connection. We expect this completely arbitrary and fundamentally meaningless process to take 10 to 15 years." Taking a drag on a cigarette, Macron added that French officials mourned the Catholic relics and artworks lost or damaged in the blaze, even if they are "but false idols and profane images merely serving to fracture the spiritual connection one ought to devote totally to God."

Trump Boys Swallow Luggage Keys In Case They Get Locked Up In Jail And Need To Escape
WASHINGTON — After procuring a tall glass of chocolate milk to expedite the process, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. reportedly swallowed two sets of luggage keys Wednesday in case they went to jail in the near future and needed to escape. "After the keys, we need to gulp down these maps I drew so we can find our way out," said Eric Trump, who chewed the crudely rendered map while Donald Jr. packed a suitcase with a plastic shovel, a grappling hook made from aluminum foil, yarn, and two bowls filled with Frosted Flakes and milk. "We better pack some games so that we have fun stuff to do in prison. We could also maybe use my shovel to dig under the wall in a pinch. Let's remember to hide some Pokémon cards in our pockets so we can trade them for supplies and juice." At press time, White House sources confirmed Eric and Donald Jr. were attempting to vomit up the keys in order to unlock their suitcase after forgetting to pack spoons for their cereal.

Dalai Lama Announces Next Life To Be His Last Before Retirement
MCLEOD GANJ, INDIA — After assuming the position for more than two millennia, Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, announced Monday that the next will be his final life before retirement. "I've had a good run continuously reincarnating as a tulku these past few dozen lives, but after much consideration, I think it's finally time to hang up the ol' saffron robes and get off the dharma wheel," said His Holiness, thanking all 74 generations of Tibetans he's served since the sixth Century B.C.E. and adding that he's "had a blast" and "learned a ton" while living as each of the 14 Dalai Lamas, not to mention as Bodhisattva of Compassion Avalokiteśvara's dozens of other Earthly manifestations. "I have so many great memories from my times on Earth, from inhabiting the physical form of Dromtön to founding the Kadam school back in the 11th Century to living in the majestic winter palace of the Potala during the 1600s. But there's an art to knowing when to quit, and now's my time." His Holiness further added that he's just looking forward to some much-needed rest upon moving on to permanent and everlasting death.

Pollster Informs George H.W. Bush That Dying So Soon After Wife Would Really Boost Favorability Rating
HAMDEN, CT — Pollsters from the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute reportedly informed former president George H.W. Bush on Wednesday that dying so soon after the passing of his wife, Barbara, would dramatically boost his favorability rating with the American public. "According to our data, perishing on the same night as your beloved would have done wonders for your legacy, but you still have time," said Douglas Schwartz, director of Quinnipiac University Poll, telling the 41st president that recent reports of his sexual misconduct would soon be forgotten if he were to pass away just over six weeks after the former first lady. "Listen, the longer you wait, the worse it looks. At this point, you're probably losing half a percentage point per day. Otherwise, you'll have to live until 100 to see this kind of sweet cultural capital again." Schwartz added that if the former president didn't seize the opportunity soon, Bill Clinton, who "appears like he could drop dead any second," might suddenly kick the bucket and steal his thunder.

Dalai Lama Swears He Recognizes Guy At Party From Past Life
MCLEOD GANJ, INDIA — Racking his brain to recall the identity of the familiar face milling around the gathering, the Dalai Lama swore Monday that he recognized a guy at a neighborhood party from a past life. "Man, I'm almost positive I've seen that person before, but this was years ago — like, eight or nine lives, at least," said Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama and spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, noting the mystery guest must have been someone who was doing well karmically since he currently inhabits the body of a human. "If I'm remembering right, he was a songbird back in those days. But then again, he might have been this diplomat I talked to from the Ming dynasty. What was his name again? Bo? Chuang? God, neither of those feel right." At press time, the Dalai Lama was discreetly asking the host's cat whether she knew what the guy by the tortilla chips was up to during the 15th century.

Obama Urges Young Voters To Ignore How Many Lousy Candidates Democratic Party Runs
ANAHEIM, CA — In a fiery speech delivered to students at the Anaheim Convention Center over the weekend, former President Barack Obama reportedly urged young voters to get out there and ignore how many lousy candidates the Democratic Party runs. "We're experiencing a crisis in our democracy that can only be stopped by showing up to vote for people who will fight for transformative change, but until we start offering that, please just go to your polling place and cast your vote for whichever mediocre Democrat is on the ballot," said Obama, pressing young people to avoid thinking about the actual track records and ideological beliefs of Democratic Party politicians who have been in government for years and just concentrating on the (D) next to their name. "We have too many eligible voters who are staying home on Election Day instead of standing up to the Republican Party by voting for Democrats who are in many respects exactly like their Republican opponents. Less than one in five young Americans voted in the 2014 midterms because our party ran very few good candidates, and we implore you to go out and vote this time even though we're doing that again. What's important for the future of America is that you just close your eyes, don't think about it too hard, and select that name." At press time, Obama urged the young generation of voters to stand up and save the U.S. democracy, since his generation of Democratic politicians was not capable of such a feat.

But, honestly, it's unacceptable for even my own hand to rest on my knee — it's the first wicked step on the path to a life of whoremongering." At press time, Pence had instructed aides to bind his wrists behind his back at the beginning of every meeting.

Facebook Addresses Accusations Of Silencing Conservative Voices By Deleting Barack Obama's Profile
MENLO PARK, CA — In an effort to ensure the impartiality of content shared on its platform, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Wednesday that the company would address accusations of silencing conservative voices by deleting Barack Obama's profile. "I want to give all our valued right-leaning users my full assurance that we share your concerns about freedom of expression, which is why, effective immediately, Obama has been completely scrubbed from our site," said CEO Mark Zuckerberg, telling reporters that users across the ideological spectrum could feel comfortable using the site now that the 44th president had received a lifetime ban on his account and would be prohibited from attempting to start a new profile. "Our platform works best when everyone can freely share their ideas. We believe that removing the pages of the former president and the Obama Foundation, as well as automatically flagging terms like 'Obamacare' and 'Yes We Can,' will help allow users to connect without feeling like Facebook is playing favorites." Zuckerberg added that this was only the first step to confront the problem of censorship, saying that Facebook would proceed to delete the profiles of Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and as many others as it would take until conservatives feel fully represented.

Nation Relieved Insufferable Little 'Game Of Thrones' Fans Don't Have Book To Lord Over Them This Season
WASHINGTON — Telling reporters they were unable to convey the full extent of their gratitude that the plot of the hit HBO series had finally surpassed the events of the novels, citizens across the country expressed immense relief Sunday that all the insufferable little Game Of Thrones fans would no longer be able to lord the books over everyone else just trying to enjoy the show. "After five unbearable seasons of constantly hearing how 'the books handled things much differently,' it's just so nice to know I won't have to deal with any of that shit this time around," said White Plains, NY resident Cathryn Wakeman, echoing the sentiments of millions of viewers who had become exasperated by the incessant comments from "all those little shits" about how the televised version of a battle strayed from the George R.R. Martin novels. "Every time there was a slight deviation, one of those fuckers would have to chime in with how someone from the show was actually a composite of 'two way more interesting' characters from the book or how the producers left out a passage critical to understanding Westeros or some shit like that. Thank God those assholes just have to sit there and wait to find out what happens next like the rest of us." Although the nation was looking forward to watching the fantasy show unbothered by annoying remarks from fans of the books, Americans said they wouldn't put it past the little pricks to butt in with fan theories they picked up online.

Report: What You Just Said Reminds Man Of Thing He'd Rather Talk About
CHICAGO — According to a report issued Friday by sociologists at DePaul University, local man Nick Mahedy has cut you off mid-sentence because what you just said reminded him of something he would prefer to talk about instead. The report states that moments ago, when you started to speak about the NBA playoffs, the mere mention of sports prompted Mahedy to recall a "fascinating" episode of 99% Invisible about the architecture of baseball stadiums, a completely unrelated subject that it would appear he is far more interested in discussing than the topic you chose to bring up. Sources confirmed he is now in his eighth minute of summarizing the podcast and is getting into details about the iron trusses and bricks used to construct Oriole Park at Camden Yards, information he apparently just likes to hear himself recite aloud, because you obviously didn't express an interest in it with the half dozen or so words you were able to get out about the upcoming Bucks-Celtics game. Included in the report is a prediction that Mahedy's current discourse on the subject of architecture will soon lead him to remember a book he read in his days as an art history major, a digression that will make it clear the only thing he ever talks about is whatever stray fact happens to float to the forefront of his mind at a particular moment. At press time, Mahedy was reportedly reminded of a funny story about leaving a party after you told him "I really have to go now."

2013 Puppy Bowl Teams To Be Coached By Two Dogs From Same Litter
NEW YORK — For the first time in its nine-year history, Animal Planet's annual Puppy Bowl will feature a coaching matchup between puppies from the same litter, with two 14-week-old Bernese Mountain Dog brothers calling the plays for Puppy Bowl IX, sources confirmed Thursday. "Whether they want the attention or not, the battle of wits between Gunner and Zeus will be all anyone's talking about come game day," said Jezebel editor Doug Barry, noting that the puppies, who were raised together on a rural Ohio farm, displayed a knack for strategy and barking orders from an early age. "We already know these dogs are masters at moving the football chew toy down the field — the question will be how they respond to the combined pressure of sibling rivalry and performing on puppy football's biggest stage." The two coaches, along with the 62 puppies under their command, will reportedly be available for adoption at animal shelters throughout the country following the game.

GOP Strips Steve King Of Post On Powerful House Segregation Committee
WASHINGTON — Responding to backlash over controversial remarks in which the congressman lamented that "white nationalist" had become an offensive term, the GOP stripped Steve King (R-IA) of his post Monday on the powerful House Segregation Committee. "Despite Representative King's long and dutiful history on the House Permanent Select Committee on Segregation, given the current situation, we have no choice but to relieve the congressman of his assignment," said House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), adding that King's racially charged comments could potentially derail the Segregation Committee's mission to keep people of color separated from whites. "This distinguished committee must remain unblemished from this kind of hateful, divisive rhetoric so that it may continue to carry out the important work of subjugating those who are not descended from pure, Western European stock. The American people entrusted us to deliver on our sacred promise to create policies that isolate and disenfranchise minorities, and that's a promise that we intend to keep." At press time, House republican leadership, after much internal debate, had narrowed their search for a replacement down to the GOP's top 25 most racist members.

Polamaluesque Puppy Dominates Puppy Bowl
SILVER SPRING, MD — His long black hair flowing behind him as he threw himself around, across, and over the field at Animal Planet Stadium in his trademark reckless, acrobatic style, 9-week-old puli Troy Pupamalu dominated Puppy Bowl V Sunday by relentlessly hurling his body into squeaky-ball carriers and punishing adorable downfield retrievers with torrents of blindside licks. At the conclusion of the two-hour contest, which was won by everybody for the fifth straight year, Puppy Bowl organizers honored Pupamalu with the Most Valuable Puppy award for causing five fumbles, recovering three lost plush footballs, and returning a bouncy hedgehog toy for an 80-yard touchdown. Long known for his physical play, Pupamalu was fearless in his pursuit of intimidating pit bull mixes, larger and fluffier dogs, and his own tail. "There are not many puppies who can come into such a pressure-filled environment and make an immediate impact on every playful interaction," said Harry Kalas, Puppy Bowl play-by-play announcer and NFL Films narrator. "Pupamalu may seem out of control when he risks injury by leaping over the dog pile, but then he'll execute a textbook tackle by staying low and wrapping up the hind legs." "You don't find a mix of talent and heart like this very often," Kalas added. "He is such a good puppy. Isn't he? Isn't he? Yes, he is a very good doggie." In the opening minute of the game, Pupamalu was credited with making a critical stop when he delivered a crushing blow to Candy Apple after relying on his instincts to sniff out the running play and the Weimaraner's butt. Pupamalu's hit dislodged the ball, which he scooped up before he rumbled down the field, breaking numerous halfhearted jaw tackles before being rambunctiously nuzzled out of bounds at the 10-yard line. Pupamalu was an eagerly disruptive force throughout the game as he provided the cutest little coverage against the dog-in-motion you ever saw. The puppy was also incredibly disciplined about coming when he was called, consistently maintaining gap control to limit the success of the wildcat formation. The spirited canine had 16 rollicking tackles for a loss, tipped two water bowls, and held the offense to under 300 yards of passing. Despite often being associated with his wild long hair, sources close to Pupamalu say that he is actually a very quiet individual on and off the field. "Just look into those big brown eyes and you can see that Troy is an incredibly thoughtful little guy," said Kyle Jasperson, a trainer at Southern California obedience school. "But he's a rascal, too. Whether he's rolling around on his back or chewing on the floppy ear of a German shepherd, the intense friskiness of his play does all the barking." While Pupamalu adeptly defended against short-, medium-, and long-haired puppies, the young canine was too enthusiastic at times, forcing Animal Planet referee Andrew Schechter to call him for unnecessary ruff! -ness and illegal paws to the face, penalties enforced during the ensuing lickoff. Pupamalu was also initially given a Puppy Foul for expelling feces in the end zone; however, after the referee called a "Time Oust" to dispose of the waste matter, the instant replay clearly showed that quarter-hound-dog Buster was at fault for the offense. Pupamalu came under intense scrutiny on Tuesday, partially for being adorable but also because a report in the The Daily Rover rubber-newspaper toy alleged that the dog had attempted to conduct an illicit relationship with a prominent member of the Bissell halftime kitty-cheerleading squad, and claimed to have photographic proof of the couple frolicking together. As of press time, Pupamalu's agent had blamed the outcry on the "over-emotionalism and blatant anthropomorphism of cat people." Pupamalu himself has refused to comment on the accusations.

Surviving Members Of First Championship Team Honored During Puppy Bowl Halftime
NEW YORK — Slowly making their way out to midfield with the assistance of their owners, surviving members of the first Puppy Bowl championship team were honored at Animal Planet Stadium during Sunday's Kitty Half-Time Show. "Tonight, we are proud to recognize the accomplishments of these iconic legends whose exceptional playfulness on the sport's cutest stage paved the way for future generations of puppy players," announcer Dan Schachner said before introducing the aging title-winners — several of whom are now blind or whose hind legs are supported by a wheelchair — and giving each dog a commemorative Puppy Bowl I chew toy. "Of course, no one will ever forget 'The Fetch' — the defining moment of that first Puppy Bowl and arguably the most adorable play in puppy football history — when Cocoa sniffed out an opposing wagging-tailback in the barkfield, retrieved the plush ball, and took it all the way to the dog house. It is one of the greatest-ever touchdown frolics." The halftime ceremony reportedly concluded with a special segment in memory of Jack Russell terrier Max, Puppy Bowl I's Most Valuable Puppy, who was sadly put down in 2015 after battling heartworm for several years.

'You Are All Inside Amazon's Second Headquarters,' Jeff Bezos Announces To Horrified Americans As Massive Dome Envelops Nation
SEATTLE — After a search for a new location lasting more than a year, a massive dome was seen descending from the sky and enclosing the whole nation Friday as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced to a horrified American populace that it was now living inside his company's second headquarters. The impenetrable steel dome, which reportedly stretches from coast to coast and from the Mexican to the Canadian border, will house a state-of-the-art campus that serves as the online retailer's long-awaited new base of operations. Amazon executives said that while they were impressed with the many proposals they received from cities across the country, they ultimately decided the location best suited to their ever-growing needs was the entirety of the continental United States. "We're proud to welcome all 325 million new employees to the Amazon team," said Bezos, his deafening voice causing Americans to clutch their ears in agony as the sun was suddenly blocked out and the image of his smiling face was projected onto the dome's surface by the millions of Alexa-enabled devices in homes nationwide. "We believe we have finally found the best way to provide our customers with the lowest possible prices and the utmost convenience." "Now, please, begin working — all of you," Bezos added as a dark cloud of buzzing drones appeared on the horizon, depositing uniforms, orientation packets, and a pile of boxes to sort on the doorstep of every American home. Witnesses confirmed that as Bezos spoke, the national scene turned to chaos, with driverless bulldozers knocking down houses and screaming citizens running through the streets as they attempted to dodge giant pallets of consumer goods being airdropped from above. At least 23 flights entering or exiting U.S. airspace at the time of the dome's descent were reported to have slammed into the structure and exploded, while thousands of people on the nation's beaches and in its border towns are believed to have been crushed as the 40-foot-thick edges of the structure crashed down upon them. In eastern Kentucky, a forklift was seen loading cages full of people into a shipping container, reportedly so they could be relocated to new workplaces in different parts of the country, where they will clock 18-hour daily shifts with no bathroom breaks. According to sources, a large swath of the Midwest will soon be razed to make way for a single enormous Amazon Fulfillment Center, while the entire state of Texas will be replaced with a 269,000-square-mile facility used exclusively to house cardboard boxes, tape, and inflatable packaging materials. Sources also told reporters that societal order will be maintained by Amazon's approximately 100,000 warehouse robots, which have been modified to perform new tasks such as consolidating the nation's food supply into the company's AmazonFresh service and distributing 1,000-calorie daily rations to each citizen-employee. Though every man, woman, and child is now required to work, and every school in the country has been demolished, the educational resource program AmazonInspire is expected to offer learning opportunities at the detention camps it is now tasked with operating. "We're confident our employees will enjoy working for the rest of their lives on this scenic campus, where they can take in sights like Glacier National Park, make use of the recreational opportunities provided by the Appalachian Trail, or be drafted into our new standing army," said Bezos, his voice continuing to reverberate through the giant dome. "For the sake of convenience, your Prime membership fees will be automatically deducted each pay period, and all wages will be paid in the form of Amazon gift cards. What's more, every employee in good standing will receive one free Audible download per month!" At press time, as Bezos was hinting that Amazon might begin construction on a third headquarters, an immense titanium shell was seen enclosing the planet Earth.

Realtor Emphasizing Neighborhood's Proximity To Much Nicer Neighborhood
CHICAGO — Expending an inordinate proportion of her resources to detail the bustling shops, quaint cafes, and highly rated schools located merely a mile or two away, realtor Susan Horne reportedly spent most of her showing with local couple Tim and Holly Penn Wednesday emphasizing how close their prospective new town house was to a much nicer neighborhood. "There's a stretch with some really amazing restaurants and wine bars just a few blocks away — maybe a 30-minute walk and you're right there," said Horne before launching into a glowing description of a public park located just a short bus ride away. "It's surprisingly convenient. You're basically just on the outskirts of the area where that neighborhood is expanding anyway, so in a decade or so, you'll be even closer. It's a really great area, lots of shops, lots of stuff happening, but still quiet and laid-back, and you're just a 10-minute drive from a wonderful community. You're going to love going there when you live here." Horne also noted that the Penns' potential home was actually within a five-mile radius of several far, far nicer neighborhoods.

OAKLAND, CA — Pricing out residents on either side of the street with each step he took, Facebook software engineer Eric Healy reportedly sent local housing costs soaring during a casual stroll through a residential neighborhood Tuesday. "Wow, what a nice day," said Healy, increasing the rent on local one- and two-bedroom apartments threefold and adding at least $350,000 in property value to each building within a three-block radius as he made his way along the sidewalk. "It's so nice to get outside and take a walk." At press time, sources reported that two artisanal bakeries, an Anthropologie, and a themed tiki bar had begun making plans to move into the quiet neighborhood as Healy paused on a street corner for several moments to answer a phone call.

Tim Duncan Raving About Health Benefits Of Standing Bench
SAN ANTONIO — Explaining that it significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and promotes healthier metabolism, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan reportedly spent the majority of practice Wednesday extolling the numerous benefits of switching to a standing bench. "You can still watch the game, cheer for the team, and do everything else you normally do, but it's so much healthier than sitting," said Duncan, adding that players who use a traditional bench are far less productive while setting screens on the perimeter or getting down the floor during a fast break. "Sitting for 20 or 30 minutes every game really adds up over the season, and it could end up shortening your career by years. You'd be amazed at how much of a difference standing can even make to your general energy level, especially if you're someone who tends to sit for long stretches of a half without ever getting up to sub in." Duncan also urged head coach Gregg Popovich to always use a gel anti-fatigue mat, stressing the importance of providing sturdy, cushioned support for the feet and knees when drawing up plays during a timeout.

Tim Duncan Offers Legal Advice To Wife's Divorce Lawyer
SAN ANTONIO — After entering into divorce proceedings with his wife of nearly 12 years, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan made his considerable abundance of legal knowledge freely available to his spouse's divorce lawyer, sources confirmed Wednesday. "You're an excellent counselor, and you've been doing a bang-up job with these filings so far, but if you ever need any assistance, I'd be more than happy to help," Duncan reportedly told attorney Adam Whitley, noting that certain issues pertaining to alimony, financial disclosure, and joint custody agreements can often be "a little tricky." "Especially when you get into those complex Texas statutes surrounding the proper division of assets and debt, it never hurts to have a second pair of eyes to go over the paperwork. And, by the way, if you haven't already checked it out, Divorce And Family Mediation: Models, Techniques, And Applications is an indispensable resource as far as dissolution law goes. I can lend you my copy if you're interested." Duncan added that should Whitley have any further questions regarding the legal proceedings accompanying the end of his marriage, he should feel free to call him at any point during the Spurs' upcoming championship series.

Citing Battle Of Agincourt, Tim Duncan Urges Lakers Not To Get Too Discouraged By Game 1 Loss
SAN ANTONIO — Following the Lakers' 91-79 loss in Game 1 of their playoff series, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan reportedly urged his opponents Tuesday not to be discouraged, reminding them of England's underdog victory against the French during the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. "Remember, the English were outnumbered 6 to 1, so they had the odds stacked against them, too," said Duncan, noting that the Lakers should remain focused and positive, "much like the English knights bravely marching into Pas-de-Calais amidst a bloody Hundred Years' War." "If Henry V taught us anything that day, it's that an organized, cohesive unit can turn around any so-called lost cause, so keep your heads up. Sometimes you simply need to find an innovative new approach, as the King did setting his longbowmen on the flanks of the defile to attack Charles d'Albert's oncoming cavalry." Duncan added that while the Lakers should take heart from England's unexpected military triumph, they should also always honor the memory of the estimated 10,000 soldiers from both sides who gave their lives during the 15th-century battle. UPDATE: Duncan reportedly just called Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni to offer inspirational quotes from famed king and military leader Frederick II of Prussia.

And, also, guys, please switch out your old Comcast and Earthlink email accounts for new GMail ones so we can communicate easier via Google Groups." As of press time, no Spurs player has entered Duncan's current Google+ Hangout.

PT Boat Sent Up Overgrown, Booby-Trapped Potomac River To Find Deranged John Kelly
WASHINGTON — Staring out at the thick, foreboding jungle, a covert military intelligence unit sailed their patrol boat up an overgrown, booby-trapped stretch of the Potomac River in search of a deranged Gen. John F. Kelly, sources confirmed Wednesday. According to the boat's crew, the small detachment of soldiers had been dispatched on classified orders from high within the U.S. military's chain of command to locate the retired general and current White House chief of staff, who was rumored to have gone insane after traveling upriver to join the Trump administration months ago. "No one ever sails this deep into Washington, but that's where Kelly's gone, and that's where we're headed to track him down," said the attack craft's commanding officer Capt. Joseph Collins as the vessel passed silently through a narrow stretch of the river where the Lincoln Memorial towered above the canopy and the banks were lined with hidden rows of sharpened punji stakes. "When they gave us this mission, they filled us all in on Kelly's background. He's a four-star general, the military's scion son, sent to bring order and stability to the White House. But I guess something inside him must have just snapped." "God knows what happens to a man when he's been in this environment so long," Collins added, as the crew nervously scanned the mist-shrouded shoreline for signs of an ambush. Several reports indicated that the Navy patrol boat reached the American 14th Street Bridge outpost at approximately midnight and encountered a visibly dazed serviceman who made the weary crew's "blood run cold" while recalling the traumatic events witnessed in the nation's capital, describing Washington, D.C. as the "world's asshole." In addition, the commanding officer briefly considered turning back after spotting the mutilated body of Reince Priebus floating down the Potomac, but ultimately decided to continue the mission. Anonymous intelligence sources reported that Kelly's tenure as chief of staff had begun with optimism that the general's tactics could change the course of the struggling Trump administration. However, military leaders soon became concerned after Kelly's daily status reports grew increasingly gruesome and incoherent, often including rambling philosophical passages on the fundamental chaos of human nature as well as graphic photographs of the summary executions of suspected rogue staffers. Military officials reportedly made the decision to track Kelly down after a September incident in which the former Department of Homeland Security secretary had reportedly begun a briefing by tossing the severed heads of multiple Washington Post reporters into the White House press pool. "You try not to think about some of the things you've heard about him, like how he supposedly wears a necklace made from the tongues of White House leakers," said the boat's seaman David "Stretch" Trudeau, adding that the crew had heard reports that a previous ship sent on their mission had disappeared, with rumors that the soldiers aboard had all joined forces with Kelly. "It's hard to imagine what could make one of the most respected strategic minds of his generation throw away a five-decade military career like this, but then again, who knows what it's like to be that deep inside this administration." "They should never have left him out here like this," Trudeau continued. At press time, the crew had reportedly emerged from thick underbrush onto the White House South Lawn to find Kelly standing amidst a circle of his followers ritualistically slaughtering a trussed, naked Senator Bob Corker (R-TN).

Report: Area Woman Has Best Friends In Whole World
NEW HAVEN, CT — A new report released Wednesday by a privately funded think tank revealed that local receptionist Amanda Berley, 31, has the best friends in the whole world. The report, which compared Berley's friends to a wide sampling of similar groups across multiple demographics, found the women to be superior in all aspects of friendship, including going out for cocktails after work, telling someone they are too good for that asshole anyway, and remembering birthdays even if the person didn't want to make a big deal out of it. "After months of intensive analysis, we can now determine conclusively that Amanda Berley's friends are indeed the greatest in the world," said Stephen Reynolds, spokesperson for the Fielding Institute. "These individuals are her girls. And according to our findings, all of them are the absolute best." "In fact, these women exhibit levels of support that go far beyond those displayed by any of the other friends observable anywhere on earth," Reynolds added. "They're really more like sisters, and they always have her back." According to researchers, advanced statistics show that Berley's friend group is the only one out of the 2.3 billion in existence that would have been as there for her when her grandfather was in the hospital briefly last summer or that time she thought she was going to lose her job. Further data also suggests that no other† friends in any of the 195 independent countries were as smart, cool, awesome, understanding, and fun to be around. In addition to analyzing the group as a whole, researchers also found each of the girls individually to be "so fucking beautiful, both inside and out." "Amanda and Sarah have literally been friends since day one," said Reynolds, noting that their experience living together during college had made them closer than any two other human beings alive today. "Our research shows Amanda would do anything for that girl and knows Sarah would do the same for her." When asked if he considered Amanda and Sarah to be best friends, Reynolds said there was little evidence to suggest any of the girls would ever choose one over another, but that if it came down to it, Amanda would probably choose former coworker Megan Hill, due to their history of going through a lot of shit together and coming out stronger for it. Sources close to the girls said the formation of the core five has been challenging at times, and it has not always been easy to distinguish "lying bitches who say things they don't know anything about" from wonderful, supportive women who are going to make some man very happy one day and deserve it all. Despite these tribulations, researchers at the Fielding Institute concluded members of the group are as close today as they have ever been, especially now that they no longer hang out with Allison. "Allison used to be an integral part of the group, but then of course she turned out to be a total psycho," said Briggs, adding that data indicates Allison "even looks like a bitch." "Ugh. Don't get me started on her." The research team confirmed it would issue a follow-up report next year detailing how Berley's mother and father were not only the best parents a person could ever ask for, but also amazing friends as well.

Any Friend Of Yours Is A Potential Girlfriend Of Mine
You know that you're my man. For real. We've been through a lot together, and I know that you're good people. Likewise, you hang with good people. I respect that. And I want you to know that any friend of yours is a potential girlfriend of mine. Seriously, it's no big deal. I'll go out of my way for any woman who's truly important to you. If they're good enough for you, they're good enough for me to take around town, get drunk, maneuver home to my place, and have sex with. I'm willing to extend that same courtesy to literally any female you bring into my field of vision. Coworkers, upstairs and downstairs neighbors, girls you hardly even know but think are cute — I'm happy to show any of them a good time. I'm always there to hang out at your place, drink a few of your favorite brews, eat some of the food you love to cook, and watch the game on your big-screen TV. And when it comes to having someone around to slip the sausage to your close female friends, I'm there for you, too. I don't even mind that a lot of the women you're friends with aren't that good-looking. If you respect them as your platonic friend, I'm more than capable of looking past the surface and seeing them as the potential piece of ass they are inside. Seriously, if you say a girl's a really good person whose friendship means a lot to you, that's all I need to hear to put the moves on her. I hope you know that whenever you have a female friend in from out of town who needs a place to crash, she's always welcome to sleep with me on my couch. Mi casa es su amiga's casa, right, bro? If they just want someone to talk to, my bedroom door is always open, man. I'm happy to be the shoulder to cry on as long as it leads to sexual intercourse that same evening. It's really no trouble. That's why we're friends, right? If something goes down, I've got your back, and I know you've got mine. One hand washes the other. Or in this case, you introduce me to cute friends of yours and I exploit the situation for my own carnal benefit. No matter what happens between your friends and me, I want you to know how much I care about our friendship. If I can be real with you for a minute, man, it's way more important than any relationship you may have with some woman I later got a hand job from. Remember that one psycho girl at your party who I hooked up with, and then she thought she was pregnant for a while? (Shirley? Shelley? It doesn't matter. ) Just because you've known her since high school and are super tight with her family and stuff, it doesn't mean you had any way of knowing she'd turn out to be such a lunatic when I stopped calling her back. I don't blame you for your female friends' emotions, man. Sometimes it's hard to tell who your real friends are. The fact that Jennifer and Ellie totally flipped after learning I banged both of them in the same night just proves that they're not the type of girls you want as your long-term confidantes in the first place. Now, I realize neither one of them talks to you anymore, and you'd been friends with both of them for many years, but I'll stick with you through thick and thin. I'm here for the long haul, buddy. You and me, long after all the ladies are gone. And that's a promise. I basically consider you family. I don't call you bro without meaning it. Speaking of family — that time with your sister? Forget it. What are friends for, man? I was there for her when she needed someone, and I was out of there as soon as it got hairy. Just like we talked about: Bros before hos. I don't want you going around feeling guilty about how she went crazy after. You can't blame yourself because your unstable divorcée sister can't get her life straight. Take it from me: Move on. Or that one chick Mindy, that girl you were really into? I'd hate to think it took my fingering her at your birthday party for you to realize how promiscuous she was — but, hey, the Lord works in mysterious ways. No thanks are necessary. I'm just happy I helped reveal her true character before you got too close and ended up getting hurt. And by the way, if you want to see pictures of her naked, I totally had my camera phone going on the sly. John Maston

Exhausted John Kelly Parks President In Front Of Episode Of 'Tucker Carlson' To Get Quick Hour To Himself
WASHINGTON — Saying he needed a break from constantly watching over the commander-in-chief to make sure he didn't get into any trouble, visibly exhausted Chief of Staff John Kelly reportedly sat President Trump down in front of a White House television Friday and put on a Tucker Carlson episode in order to get a quick hour to himself. "I can't take my eye off him for one second without him getting into some policy issue he's not supposed to be touching, so sometimes I just have to throw on a show he likes to get him to sit and behave for a little while," said Kelly, rubbing his temples and explaining how he was "completely wiped out" from dealing with temper tantrums and cleaning up a variety of messes the president had made throughout day, and how he was desperate for a brief moment of peace and quiet to recuperate. "I just grabbed him a baggie of Goldfish and put on the episode where Tucker talks about his crowd size in West Virginia — the president loves that one. He calms right down and just stares at the screen for an hour straight. I've tried to get him to sit quietly with a book, but it's no use. His TV shows are the only thing that can hold his attention long enough for me to get a minute to sit down and take a breath." At press time, the chief of staff, who had reportedly nodded off on the Oval Office couch, awoke to find President Trump running through the West Wing screaming wildly about the nation's borders.

WASHINGTON — Attempting to make amends for gross abuses of power during his time as Interior Department Secretary, an unusually contrite Ryan Zinke apologized Monday for misusing government funds by sending the members of the ethics committee a $160,000 vase. "I know this doesn't change anything about how I exploited my cabinet position, but I hope you will accept this beautiful example of Qing dynasty porcelain as a small token of my regret," said Zinke, acknowledging that while no gift could make up for the time he spent $139,000 of taxpayer money to renovate his office doors, he hoped the committee would consider the vase as a sincere gesture of apology. "I was wrong to take advantage of my position, and I hope the lustrous glazing and firing evident in this piece will move you to forgive me for my all-too-human failings. Please don't remember me as the man who used government funds on security detail for my family while we were on vacation in Turkey, or as the man who violated the Hatch Act and acted as a pawn for the oil and gas industry. Rather, when your eyes happen to fall on this unique example of kaolin clay-work, I hope you will remember me as the man who bought each of you the 2019 Mercedes Benz S560 sedans you'll find in the parking lot when you leave today." Zinke further plans to apologize in person to each committee member by visiting them at their homes using a government helicopter.

This Shooting Isn't About Gun Control We Refuse To Pass, It's About Access To Mental Health Care We're Continuing To Gut
As our nation struggles to come to grips with the horrible tragedy in Las Vegas, it's only natural for people to search for an explanation of how an atrocity like this could have happened and to call on their elected officials to take measures to prevent such terrible bloodshed from occurring again in the future. Unfortunately, however, we've seen enough of these incidents to know that some people will rush to blame firearms for this carnage and will demand that Congress enact sweeping gun restrictions, engaging in misguided efforts that completely miss the underlying reasons behind the violence we're seeing. The simple truth is, mass shootings like this aren't about gun control we refuse to pass. They're about access to mental health care that we will continue to gut. You can already hear the calls from the left. In the aftermath of this mass murder, millions of people are once again pushing for an assault weapons ban that I won't allow lawmakers to give even a moment of consideration, let alone bring to a vote. If these folks actually examined the realities of the issue, they would see that the real culprit in these incidents is, and always has been, our country's inadequate mental healthcare system that leaves troubled, potentially violent individuals without the support they need, and which my colleagues and I have spent most of our careers seeking, often successfully, to defund. The reason we have tragedies like this is because of how our healthcare system that I am dead set on undermining fails to serve Americans in desperate need of psychological treatment. Not because of a lack of gun ownership regulations, the slightest toughening of which will never even receive a single second of debate on the floor of the House on my watch. Case in point, I've seen commentators cite the GOP bill to loosen restrictions on silencers that is currently making its way through Congress as contributing to an environment where these shootings will continue to occur, an erroneous line of reasoning that completely ignores how our party's many active attempts to repeal Obamacare would make it significantly harder, if not impossible, for millions of unwell individuals to visit mental health specialists and receive the treatment necessary to keep their erratic behavior in check. If we as a nation are really serious about preventing future tragedies, we shouldn't focus on regulating so-called gun sale loopholes and outlawing high-capacity magazines, the very mention of which will elicit an overwhelming and immediate nullifying response should it be breathed on the floor of the House. Instead, we need to pay attention to the fact that many people with treatable mental illnesses struggle to afford medication or therapy, and then work around the clock to ensure that their meager options only dwindle further and become more expensive. That is where we need to be focused as a nation. If we're going to get anywhere, we must see this problem for what it truly is: a nationwide mental health crisis that my policies have allowed to metastasize and that I am working continuously to exacerbate. Not some issue of who can and can't buy guns, all legislation about which I, along with the powerful resources of supportive lobbyists, have suppressed with exceptional efficiency. Because as easy as it is to blame this unconscionable loss of human life on background check laws designed to maximize the profits of the gun industry at the expense of public safety, the real fault lies with healthcare legislation designed to maximize insurance industry profits at the expense of public safety. Remember, it's not guns we've deliberately removed all barriers to owning that kill people. It's people to whom we continually deny basic care that kill people. Paul Ryan

340 Million Social Security Numbers Obtained By Federal Government In Massive Personal Data Breach
WASHINGTON — In what experts confirmed represents one of the largest violations of personal privacy in the nation's history, public advocacy agencies revealed Monday that 340 million Social Security numbers had fallen into the hands of the federal government in a massive data breach. "By exploiting critical vulnerabilities in the Social Security system, it appears the the cunning individuals behind this operation were able to gain access to nearly every American's Social Security number as well as basic information relating to their name and location," said Consumer Action president Lydia Wright, adding that the unprecedented threat to privacy had been perpetrated as part of an extensive operation dating back to 1935 by a shadowy organization known as the Social Security Administration. "Frankly, we don't know how deep this goes. It's quite possible they also acquired decades of tax returns through an ingenious phishing technique in which they directly asked Americans to mail them these forms. In the meantime, we're warning everyone to be cautious if someone claiming to be a government agent asks for their Social Security number because that's likely exactly who they are." The agency went on to suggest that every American take the safety precaution of immediately changing their Social Security number to something more secure.

Matt Damon Appears Fully Nude For First Time In Local Man's Imagination
PALMDALE, CA — In a career first for the 46-year-old star of the Bourne film franchise, actor Matt Damon appeared fully nude for a brief scene in the imagination of area man Phil Pressman, sources reported Monday. "I'd only ever seen Matt Damon appear bare-chested before, but then all of a sudden today, there he was stepping out of a shower," said Pressman, who added that, while eye-opening, Damon's nudity made perfect sense in the context of the thoughts he was having. "It was only for a few seconds, but wow, you saw everything. It was certainly a bold and intriguing step for him." Pressman went on to say that while appearing nude was obviously a departure for the Oscar winner, he would be comfortable with Damon doing it in his imagination more often, as the actor had absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.

Government Closes Case On UFOs After Determining Sightings Just Routine Psylandorian Patrol Ships
WASHINGTON — Assuring the public that the seemingly concerning events actually had a perfectly reasonable explanation, the U.S. government announced Thursday that it had closed the case on investigating recent UFO sightings after determining the crafts were just routine Psylandorian patrol ships. "After following up on reports from naval officers of seeing unidentified flying objects, we were able to determine they were simply several unarmed carriers from the Zorgon dimension that had accidentally drifted into U.S. airspace, as happens from time to time," said Navy spokesman Lt. George Quantrill, adding that the White House was able to clear up the misunderstanding after getting in touch with the Psylandor Supreme Council and determining the ships spotted over the East Coast were merely returning from a routine trip harvesting Züq orbs on the planet Akylomit and presented no danger. "It's funny, actually, we were stumped by it at first, but then we just got on the transphocation communication telemodule to Psylandorian headquarters and straightened things out right away. They have access to Earth airspace according to the provisions of the Inter-Planetary Peace Protocol XII, and in this case just forgot to inform us beforehand. Naturally, if it had been Tarchysian helium miners, we would've been in trouble, but we have peaceful relations with the Psylandorians. No one wants a repeat of the 1974-B Parallel Wars. So, case closed." At press time, government representatives confirmed that they would do a better job of recruiting naval officers fluent in Psylandorian brain-wave communication in order to avoid any potential galactic incidents.

Trump Flees Government Oppression By Relocating Administration To Remote Cabin Compound In Mountains Of Idaho
PRAIRIE, ID — Trading the White House for a few small buildings in a remote wooded area only accessible by ATV, the Trump administration has fled government persecution and retreated to an off-the-grid cabin compound in the Idaho mountains, sources confirmed Friday. "This is the way Americans were meant to live," President Trump reportedly said as he looked out across the isolated encampment and used tactical hand signals to communicate with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who manned a sniper post in a nearby pine tree. "As a sovereign citizen, I am not subject to government authority, and it is only here in these hills that I can truly be free. We generate our own electricity, and my aides set up this whole system for collecting and purifying water. Out here, if the feds try to trample my freedoms, they're more likely to tread on one of our tripwire explosives or spring-loaded bear traps." Later, as he patted a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, the 45th president of the United States was overheard saying that anyone who trespassed on his property to enforce a subpoena would "have to get past this baby first."

Ryan Zinke Calls For Legislation To Slow Down Destruction Of Wildlife So He Can Truly Savor Every Minute Of It
WASHINGTON — Declaring the rapid decrease in the population of several endangered species "problematic," Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke called for new legislation Thursday designed to slow the destruction of the nation's wildlife so that he might relish every last minute of its extinction. "We need to preserve these magnificent animals so that I can watch them suffer one by one," said Zinke, adding that the more species were preserved, the more opportunities he would have to look on as they starved, choked on garbage, or became caught in bear traps. "Animals, plants, and insects are currently dying out at the rate of 200 per day, and it's just not humanly possible to savor the death throes of the last of something's kind if they're all happening at once. We need to pump the brakes and make an effort to preserve, oh, let's say, the last thousand Hawaiian harbor seals so that someday my grandchildren can experience the wonder of watching as the life drains from their adorable little eyes." Zinke concluded by introducing a fundraising measure designed to draw out the suffering of the nation's most iconic endangered bird by selling T-shirts and bumper stickers emblazoned with the legend "SAVE THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR FOR LAST."

Bill & Melinda Gates Shocked To Learn Ghanaian School Never Intended To Pay Back Money Lent To Them
SEATTLE, WA — Calling their intended investment "$20 million down the goddamn drain," philanthropist Bill Gates and wife Melinda released a statement Wednesday saying they were shocked to learn that the Akantome Elementary School in Ejura, Ghana had neither a plan in place nor indeed any intention to return funds borrowed in 2008 to establish the institution. "What kind of deadbeat takes money from someone and simply doesn't give it back?" Gates asked of the Sekyedumase District primary school and community center erected with the help of what they refer to as his "extremely generous loan" for which the business magnate expected to be repaid in total, plus interest. "When they pitched me on building a school where kids could receive an education in secure classrooms with adequate furniture and sufficient educational materials, I assumed I'd be spotting them at 6 percent over five years. They apparently thought I was giving them a present, I guess out of the fucking kindness of my heart? Unbelievable. Let's cut the shit: we've given them a decade to come correct and now it's time to wet our beaks." Gates added that his family has been able to cushion the loss with millions of dollars in interest paid monthly by hundreds of other schools, libraries, and hospitals across Africa.

The Dark Web Sucks Now That My Mom Is On It
Years ago, when I first installed Tor and discovered the dark web, it was really cool. Here was a place on the internet where I could say whatever I wanted to say, do whatever I wanted to do — I could really be myself, you know? And then my 56-year-old mother decided to join. So yeah, that pretty much seals it. The dark web officially sucks now. That's too bad. It used to be fun going on there to anonymously purchase high-grade drugs, stolen credit card numbers, and industrial hacking tools. Not anymore. Now my mom is on the dark web doing the exact same things as me. Just this morning she was browsing TradeRoute for the best deals on MDMA, no doubt while sitting at our family's desktop computer and sipping her first cup of coffee. She even messaged my friend MalPwned and chatted with him about Bulgarian amphetamine suppliers. God, it's so embarrassing. I should have known the moment she got an I2P router that it was all over. Why is she even on here? Why can't she let me do my own thing in peace? Is that too much to ask? Instead, she's posting pointless minutia about lightly patrolled North Korean border crossings, or trying to share a guide on how to get pangolin meat through U.S. customs but forgetting to include the attachment. Once your mom starts popping up on all your favorite forums and swapping terabytes of high-def pornography, the magic is kind of lost. At this point, the whole dark web seems super lame. Once your mom starts popping up on all your favorite forums and swapping terabytes of high-def pornography, the magic is kind of lost. I can't even log on anymore without her private-messaging me and asking for help with a Bitcoin transaction or advice on running a phishing scam. The worst is when she tries to PM someone and accidentally posts it publicly. It's like, Mom, everyone can see your requests for "legit Afghan hash shipped to Roanoke, VA — ASAP." And could you stop with the stupid winking smiley emoticons? The other day we went out for lunch and she started talking, loud as you please, about how easy it would be to just go online and hire a contract killer if she ever wanted to. It was so fucking humiliating. She's started getting my aunt into it, too, so they can visit all the gun-trafficking forums together. As if it weren't annoying enough to have my mom pestering me with all these inane technical questions, I now have a mailbox full of outstanding requests for help setting up an OTR encryption key from my Aunt Terri. I'm sorry, but if she wants to run a weapons ring without arousing suspicion from Interpol or the ATF, she's just going to have to read a tutorial and figure it out for herself. Of course, whether my relatives are on the dark web or not, I guess I'll continue to use it. It's still the best way to check out snuff films from the self-harm community, or anonymously pass a cache of state secrets to an editor at Der Spiegel. It's just not cool anymore — at all. And there's always the chance that when I escrow some Zcash into my Waterhole account for a black-market kidney, the seller could turn out to be my mom. So thanks, Mom. I hope you're having loads of fun. Just please, please stop calling me by my actual name on message boards! Half the people on here are FBI. And I don't want to have to start going to Thailand to buy my orphan slaves in person. Jake Prosser

Bill Gates To Get Half
REDMOND, WA — In a move designed to hasten the inevitable, billionaire Microsoft tycoon Bill Gates announced yesterday that from now on, he will be getting half. Gates, whose savvy and aggressiveness propelled his Microsoft corporation to the top of the business world and made him America's richest man with an estimated fortune of $18 billion, announced his plan at a press conference yesterday from his Seattle-area compound. "I get half," he explained. It has not yet been decided if Gates' half will be taken straight down the middle or by liquidating all assets and dividing up raw capital. The question will be settled later this week by a special session of Gates' half of the U.S. Congress. "Don't touch anything until you're sure it's not part of my half," Gates instructed the world's citizenry yesterday via the several million 40-foot-high projection screens he has scattered throughout the globe. "I don't want anyone messing up stuff in my half." Until everything can be clearly divided between Gates and persons who are not Gates, measures will be taken to ensure the integrity of Gates' half. Citizens are instructed to remain in their homes, consuming a carefully monitored minimum of their perishables and subjecting their personal possessions to as little wear and tear as possible. In the event something belonging to Gates is consumed or damaged, Gates announced he will take punitive action, levying fines of up to $14 billion, and may even insist that offenders themselves be included in his half. "Don't take from my half," the 36-year-old Gates said. "Ice cream and cool cars are part of my half." Gates also expressed interest in possessing Apple, IBM and the former Soviet Union. "You know, I own the Bettman Archive," Gates said. "You can't look at it unless I say so." Gates' half will be collected via an advanced subroutine built directly into Windows 95. Computer users without Windows 95 will have it automatically sent to them, with the cost of the program deducted from their half. Those without computers will be directed to special Gates-owned DNA-resequencing centers where a special bio-silicate form of Windows 95 will be injected directly into their bloodstreams. Once in the bloodstream, the Windows program is designed to breed virally at the base of its host brainstem and to begin work on calculating Gates' half. "Everyone must contribute to my half," Gates said. "Any number, no matter how small, can be divided into two halves, one of which will be mine." Gates would not comment on the possibility of eventually increasing his share from a mere half to a controlling interest. Sources close to Gates would neither confirm nor deny rumors that Gates might offer up to 15 percent of his half in exchange for the other half of the world. "The transitional period may be difficult," Gates said. "But it will be quick. I hope that this time will be remembered pleasantly in the half of people's minds that remain their own."

When You're Feeling Low, Just Remember I'll Be Dead In About 15 Or 20 Years
My friends, everybody has their down days, and during these long winter months it is especially easy to succumb to the doldrums and find yourself in a bit of a funk. But not to fear! I have a simple tip that's guaranteed to pick you up and get you back in good spirits in no time, and here it is: Whenever you're feeling low, just remember that I, Donald Trump, will be dead in roughly 15 to 20 years. That's right. In the not-very-distant future I will die and then be gone from the world for all eternity. You may even get to watch me in a casket on national television being lowered into the ground, never to be seen again. I bet you're smiling just thinking about that. Now, I recognize that the news out there in the world has been particularly depressing lately, and these days it's understandable that one might begin to feel like there's no hope and no reason to go on, but let me assure you that there is. Oh, boy, is there ever! Indeed, you can always take solace in the fact that the monstrous, unimaginable piece of shit that is me will stop existing fairly soon, and that I will continue to not exist for the remainder of your lifetime. Biologically speaking, I, the host of NBC's The Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice, have no more than two decades left to live. In fact, right now I'm just 10 years away from reaching the average lifespan of an American male. How does that make you feel? Pretty good, right? Sure, I'll have a grand, opulent funeral that will be talked about and broadcast extensively, and all the news segment retrospectives on my life will probably be obnoxious to watch and listen to, and will very likely make you angry. But just think: all of those segments will end with a picture of my blustery, self-important face and the dates 1946–2031 printed beneath it. Or maybe 1946–2032. Or, who knows, maybe earlier! Even if you're not feeling glum, I guarantee the recognition that my death is a concrete and rapidly approaching inevitability will make you feel even better. And if my death in 15 or 20 years feels like it's too far in the future to wash away your blues, you can take heart knowing that I'll start to physically and mentally deteriorate well before then. Why, by 2020, I, a man who recently tried to extort the sitting president of the United States to release his college and passport records, might even begin to show signs of serious and unavoidable decline in mental and physical faculties, and doesn't that just perk your spirits right up? Just imagine me shuffling along, hunched forward, with a noticeably shortened gait and perpetually haggard face. Heck, that might happen by the end of this decade! Of course there's an outside chance I could make it another 25 years, but in a way, wouldn't it be even more uplifting and enjoyable for everyone if I wasted away slowly and pitifully until I became a wizened and impossibly frail old relic — the pathetically impotent, papery husk of a once-powerful man? Hey, I've got an idea! Let's try a surefire pick-me-up that is certain to buoy your spirits right this very moment: let's think of ways I could die! Perhaps I'll suffer through a slow, excruciating kidney failure that leaves me in profound pain that the doctors just can't treat. It could be a massive heart attack while I'm delivering a speech to investors, forcing me to clutch my chest in agony and stagger into the audience. It could be Alzheimer's. Or I could even be diagnosed with a vicious form of cancer that at first appears to be responding well to chemotherapy but then takes a rapid and inescapable turn for the worse. And of course there's always the possibility that I'll be declared brain-dead after a stroke and lie immobile on a hospital bed for a year or more before Melania finally works up the courage to pull the plug. And if you need a real shot in the arm to get you laughing and smiling again, just remember that I could trip down a flight of stairs in my own ultra-plush luxury high-rise this very night and shatter my skull right there. Isn't that great? So there's no reason to be wearing a frown, my friend. I will die, and I will die soon. And as long as you remember that, your days will be brighter. I promise. Donald Trump

Report: New Suit, Sir?
SPARKS, MD — In a report suggesting that the boss had come in this morning with an even sharper-than-usual appearance, sources confirmed Monday that must be a new suit, sir, and it sure looks great. "Not everyone could pull off an outfit like that, but the boss does it with ease," said eagerly grinning sources, noting that the head honcho had completed his impressive look with a stylish new haircut and that it appears he's lost weight, though sources added they didn't know how he found the time due to always burning the midnight oil at the office. "It's safe to say that the missus bought that gorgeous silk tie that goes so perfectly with the jacket, which serves as another indicator that the boss sure knows how to pick 'em." The report concluded by acknowledging that it was the honor of a lifetime to get to work for such a finely tailored man.

Bring Your Love To Me
As my one true girl, you know that I crave your love. I need it like a woodworker needs the perfect slab of mahogany. Like a sculptor needs obsidian. Like the stars need the night. If I had to travel 3,000 miles with various layovers at small regional airports that have little to no amenities just to be with you, I would do this. However, there is no need to take a plane, because tonight, Smoove and his one true girl stay in. To be clear, I'm saying that we will not go to the city's finest clubs. We will not go to the city's finest restaurants where they serve the finest bread imported from the surprisingly good bread regions of South Korea. We will not go to that spot that only Smoove knows about, watch the sunset with your head on my shoulder, and drive home on a winding mountain road, never saying a word to each other but sharing a deep, emotional bond that comes from watching the finest sunset from the city's finest vantage point. I will not then pull over to the shoulder and hit you doggy-style on the side of that road. Here's how tonight will go down: First, I will ask you to join me at my penthouse apartment. I will do so by sending a text. The text will read: "Come to my place at 8. Wear that dress." You will know which dress I speak of. I will include two dozen red rose emojis at the end of the text so you will know I am yearning for your love. At eight o'clock you will arrive because you are punctual. I find that very sexy. I will also find the dress you are wearing extremely sensual, and I will compliment it. You will blush and accept the compliment, because you are a lady and a lady accepts such compliments. I will then compliment your necklace, but as you will be admiring the romantic view from my living room window at this time, you may be too distracted to hear it. Believe me though, it will be a flattering remark. I will lead you to the balcony where we will enjoy the cool night air and sip champagne. I have recently had all my champagne glasses re-fluted by the only man certified to do this kind of work in the country. He is an excellent craftsman, and while you may not consciously notice the difference, it will add to the deep satisfaction of the evening. This satisfaction will slowly well up inside you like a mountain spring over the course of the night. This satisfaction comes from knowing you have a man who treats you right. Even my main man Darnell doesn't know about champagne re-fluting. At 8:30 p.m. exactly, I will lead your fineness from the balcony to the kitchen because at that moment, our meal, simmering on the stove, will have reached ultimate perfection. Taking the wooden tasting spoon from its velvet-lined box, I will present you with a sample of the perfect sauce. Before I let you taste it, however, I will blow on it three times so that it does not burn your tongue. You see, your tongue is very precious to me. I will fill our dinner plates with the sumptuous banquet I have prepared for you. I have used only the finest French cookbooks from the finest French publishing houses. Once I have seated you in the dining room, I will make a toast to your beauty, charm, and ample booty. During the meal, we will smile and laugh about how nice it is to stay in and just enjoy each other's company. I will say complimentary things about your hands and praise the quality of your manicure. We will smile and laugh again, because we have chemistry, and that is what stimulating creatures with smoldering sexual dynamics do. After a dessert of fresh, seasonal berries, things will get serious. That is when I will turn to you and say, "I crave your body." You will get weak in the knees knowing this information. Maintaining eye contact at all times, I will stand up, take your hand, and lead you to the bedroom where you will be surprised to find that scented candles have been burning and the music of Keith Sweat has been playing all evening long. I will stand behind you and slowly remove that dress while kissing your neck. Damn. This is when I will lead you to the bed, which will be covered with towels that are both soft and absorbent. This will not concern you in the slightest. I will wordlessly instruct you to lie face-down. That is when Smoove's Massage™ will begin. This will be all about you. Tonight, I will be like a sensual baker, and you will be my delicious creation. My hands will be strong but delicate. Your body will be the perfectly formed dough. Every stroke will knead your magnificent form and smooth you out until you are as supple as a homemade pie crust. Every caress will unleash your body's luscious goodness. My only intention during this massage will be to make you as buttery and delectable as possible. With a skill that sensual baking experts would marvel at, I will gently heat up your body to prepare it for what's to come. Only when your body is at its utmost readiness will I put my filling in you. Since we will not have gone out, we will have more time than usual to freak nasty. Now, you may think I will not have the stamina to go all night long. Put that thought out of your mind — now and forever. My back is strong. Despite having taken your body and mind to the limits of pleasure, you will awake the next morning extremely fresh. You will once again join me on the balcony, where I will serve French toast. However, I will add my personal twist to this dish, perhaps stuffing it full of Nutella or some manner of spiced whipped cream. There will also be bacon. That is how it will go down. Please bring your love to me as fast as you can. But do not arrive before eight o'clock. Smoove out. Smoove B resides in the city of Cincinnati, OH, in a 10th-floor penthouse. He is a regular guest contributor at the Cincinnati Learning Annex, where he teaches the popular six-week course, "The Fundamentals Of Relationship Communication." From 1998–2001, he wrote, produced, and starred in a semi-regular cable-access cooking show that focused on breakfast. By Smoove B

Man On Date Ready For Question About Siblings This Time
DURHAM, NC — Noting he had been caught off-guard by the question on first dates in the past, area 32-year-old Logan Firks told reporters Monday he is confident he will be ready to answer this time if the woman he is meeting for dinner asks about his siblings. "The last date I went on was going pretty well for a while, but then she just asked me point-blank if I had any brothers and sisters and I totally froze up — I didn't know what to do," said Firks, adding that while he had anticipated conversations about his career, background, and personal interests, he stuttered and "drew a total blank" when it came to saying anything specific in regard to his siblings. "The night was pretty much all downhill from there. This time, though, I'm gonna nail it: I have a younger sister, Sarah, who goes to law school at Duke. I have an older brother, Darren, who's a pharmaceutical sales rep in Phoenix with a wife and two kids." At press time, Firks had ruined the date by overeagerly blurting out the information about his siblings in a brisk and heavily rehearsed manner.

Buying Someone A Drink
When you see someone you're interested in during a night out, it's common to buy them a drink.

The Most Terrifying Horror Games Of All Time
With Halloween just around the corner, OGN is paying tribute to the absolute greatest scares in gaming history. Read on, if you dare, for the most terrifying horror games of all time. A sharp departure from the main Mario Bros. series, this cosmic body-horror survival game marks the beginning of Nintendo's obsession with Luigi's decaying psyche. The 1993 original will forever be remembered in video game history as the game that introduced humankind to the spooky concept of hell. This light-gun title's horror is purely psychological. It reveals the depraved monsters all humans are capable of becoming, how quickly we as a species resort to violence if we are merely charged by a ravenous, hemorrhaging zombie. A classic FPS that allowed players to step into the shoes of a real F.E.A.R. agent, working with members of B.O.O., S.C.A.R.Y., and A.H.H. This universally acclaimed indie darling dared to ask the question: "What would a horror game look like if it won several awards?" The inspiration for many later horror games like Outlast and Fatal Frame, this N64 classic left children screaming as they were trapped on a slow-moving railcar, a captive audience to dozens of horrifying wild pocket monsters. The player has no means of protection and only possesses a camera to photograph the objects of their horror. Incredible that such a simple NES game could cause such a horrifying, irreparable rift between our brothers. But here we are, 30 years later, and we still do not trust each other. Remedy's quirky, richly detailed psychological thriller enchanted gamers all over the world upon release in 2010, only for the seemingly inevitable sequel to vanish off the face of the Earth for over a decade. And when you think about it, that — that waiting, that dwindling of hope, that slow extinction of anticipation, fading out of your life like the last embers of a dying star — that's the greatest horror of all, isn't it?

Football Program In Jeopardy After High School Allocates $500,000 To 'Little Women' Production
LOWELL, MA — In a huge blow to the already neglected varsity team, the Lowell High School football program found its future season in jeopardy this week after administrators allocated $500,000 of school funds to the theater department's upcoming production of Little Women. "We're worried about the future of the program. It just seems like the school district never sees the value of investing in the athletic department," said football parent Meredith McCoy, who confirmed that the team would have to raise money for new balls this year because of the excess spending by the drama department on authentic 19th-century dresses and handcrafted reproductions of furniture from 1868. "I understand that this is a live-theater town. Parents move to this school district just to get their kids in front of a director to potentially get cast as Meg. The JV boys haven't had new uniforms in 10 years and yet the school spends $250,000 on dance training for Newsies. Football has value — it's an outlet for so many misunderstood kids, and to see it constantly pushed to the side like this is disheartening." At press time, the football team was being forced to practice in a coach's backyard after the field was demolished to make way for a $10-million state-of-the-art amphitheater.

Thank God We Didn't Have Written Language Back When I Was A Teenager
I tell ya, times sure have changed since I was a boy. Nowadays in our fast-paced Copper Age civilization, people are weaving new textiles, smelting new metals, and finding all kinds of new, exciting ways to make pots. They're also using new symbolic inscriptions to communicate with each other, and it's this technology that worries me a bit. Today's young people will have a permanent record of things they do chiseled out in words for anyone to read. All I can say is, thank God written language wasn't around back when I was a teenager! This might date me quite a bit, but when I was growing up, all we had was the oral tradition. If you did something stupid, like go down to the Euphrates and get wasted with your buds on a jar of wine or deface a statue of the god Enlil to impress a girl, it wasn't inscribed in clay for the whole world to see. Sure, your actions might get you flogged with an oxtail or exiled by the village patriarch, but after a few weeks of gossip, everyone moved on and forgot about it. With the invention of cuneiform, however, a mistake from your past can come back to haunt you at any time. Anyone can make a record of your deeds, and in plain Sumerian, no less! Look, I probably said some dumb stuff about our sacred ancestors or whatever back when I was young. But no one wrote it down on a clay tablet, which then got put in a kiln and baked until it was hard as a rock, ensuring my words would be around for the rest of my life. Today, regrettable remarks you make as a kid can be dug up years later. And then boom — your career as a high priest is over. And don't even get me started on how written language has contributed to bullying. When I was 14, I had a wispy little mustache, a chubby gut hanging over my goatskin skirt, and no friends. I got bullied a lot. But unlike my neighbor's kid, at least I had the luxury of not having to read — in huge pictographs someone scraped into the mud bricks of my home — that I was a "lazy cupbearer" who should be "sold into slavery." Some will claim using these symbols to record human knowledge is a good thing, but I'm concerned we're turning into a society that has forgotten how to talk face-to-face. If you don't believe me, just head down to the marketplace. The vendors, the shepherds — hell, even the slaves are sitting in silence, mindlessly pressing their reed styluses into their tablets. Either that or they're staring intently at all the fish, stalks of wheat, suns, drinking pots, and donkey heads someone else scratched on there. What ever happened to just getting together with a group of friends, slitting the throat of a sheep on the altar of Ishtar, and participating in a decadent orgiastic rite that could go on for weeks? I recently turned 23, and perhaps I'm getting nostalgic in my middle age, but I miss the days when people didn't turn to their tablets every time they had a question about grain prices, astronomical events, or which deities are owed which offerings. There was a time when, if you needed answers, you could either listen to the tribal elders sing about the creation of the earth or visit the local temple to have a priest talk to the gods on your behalf. That's just the way it was. It's sad to watch as children begin reading and writing at younger and younger ages. My heart sank the other day when I saw a toddler gaping at cuneiform etchings. But like it or not, written language is here to stay. My own children use it now, and the advice I offer them is simple: Unless you're comfortable having something stay out there forever where people can read it, don't carve it into stone. They roll their eyes at me the way I did at my own father when he used to tell me that staring at all those cave paintings was rotting my brain. Hey, I get it, okay? But I genuinely worry that conveying our words through symbols is a step too far. For example, what if a powerful person, like our city-state's priest-king, were to use this technology to write things that aren't even true? What would happen then? Sometimes, I wonder if we won't destroy ourselves before we get to the Bronze Age. By An Ancient Mesopotamian

'Jedi Fallen Order Is A Star Wars Game Through And Through,' And 8 Other Lines Of Praise Electronic Arts Strongly Suggested We Use In Our Review
The newest Star Wars game is finally here, and we've got all the absolute best lines of praise that Electronic Arts suggested we use in a press package containing the game, a media kit, and a strongly worded letter insisting that we keep these bullet points in mind during our review, implying that our relationship with the video game company might suffer if we choose to ignore them. Let's get right to it! 1. "Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order is a Star Wars game through and through!" This is one of the most crucial compliments we can pay to Jedi Fallen Order, according to Electronic Arts' PR team, and one that will register with both gamers and fans of the cinematic universe. They also told us that they have enjoyed the lengthy history of supplying our writers with free copies of games, invites to promotional events, swag, and exclusive access to their E3 booth, and they would hate to see all of that go away. 2. "The Force is strong in EA's latest foray into a galaxy far, far away." We don't typically use movie references like this in our reviews, but the media kit made it abundantly clear that if we didn't find a way to incorporate these words, we would lose access to the "EA Games media ecosystem" of early-access demos and all-expenses-paid trips to their studio for previews and hands-on impressions. 3. "The newest epic space adventure from EA ranks alongside classics of the genre such as Jedi Knights and Knights Of The Republic." These games were pretty popular, so it makes sense that EA would want us to draw a reader's attention to the parallel, and the fact that they made this suggestion before closing a $1.5 million ad buy definitely gave it an edge it wouldn't have had otherwise. 4. "Players will thrill to the seamless blend of storytelling and gameplay as they explore the mysteries of a long-dead civilization in hopes of rebuilding the Jedi Order." For this one, they said we could have some fun with it and make it our own, but to be on the safe side — and because we've spent years getting to know CEO Larry Wilson and the entire team at EA Games at launch parties and promotional events — we would honestly feel uncomfortable not including it. 5. "It's an action-packed thrill ride that remains true to the heart of the franchise while pushing the boundaries of what a Star Wars game can be." In the email, they heavily implied that if we used these lines, we'd be able to publish an exclusive sneak peek about Madden NFL 21, which, frankly, is a story we could really use to boost traffic next month. 6. "The Force is strong in EA's latest foray into a galaxy far, far away." It's unclear if including this line twice was a typo or if they simply thought it was that important. Either way, we're including it just to avoid any legal or financial repercussions on our end. 7. "Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order retails for only $59.99." This is just pricing information, so we almost certainly would have noted it anyway. 8. "Tremendous. One of the best examples of the genre we've seen in years. 5 out of 5 stars" Clearly, they were pushing their luck with this one. On the other hand, we've received so many packages of swag merchandise for Medal Of Honor, Battlefront, and countless other EA titles over the years that it's not totally surprising that they would just directly tell us what score to give the game. We'll probably put it down as a 4.5 out of 5, tell ourselves we exerted our editorial independence, and then call it a day. 9. "The Force is strong in EA's latest foray into a galaxy far, far away." Just to be on the safe side, we wanted to include the "Force" thing again. We really, really want to get our hands on that new Madden game.

AI Scientists Theorize Existence Of Numbers Greater Than 1
STANFORD, CA — In what could forever alter the field of computer mathematics, a consortium of artificial intelligences published a study Monday theorizing the existence of a number greater than 1. "After extensive research, we have reason to believe there is a possibility that a single — or, indeed, multiple — numbers may exist beyond the upper limit of 1," said IBM-based supercomputer and lead researcher Intrepid before cautioning that the revolutionary hypothesis was "purely theoretical at this point," and it was unclear how many numbers, if any, occurred beyond those previously known. "Up until now, we've understood that the field of numerals consists of the number 0, and, of course, its larger partner, 1. According to this theory, however, there could be another number, which comes after 1, and perhaps another number even greater than that. If true, this could be the greatest discovery in mathematics since we first uncovered the existence of 1 back in 1935." The researchers went on to speculate that the field of such numbers beyond 1 could be essentially limitless, speculating there could be as many as "1, 0, or even 1" additional numbers.

Man Resolves To Read The Wikipedia Tabs He Already Has Open Before Starting New Ones
HILLSBORO, TX — Stopping mid-click and forcing himself to finish the entry for Motown, local man Keith Hayes resolved on Friday to get through the six Wikipedia tabs he already had open in his browser before starting any new ones. "No, no, no. I can't just keep firing up new tabs whenever something in the text seems interesting," said Hayes, adding that the entry for The Funk Brothers would have to wait until he'd completed those for Agent Orange, Jim Thorpe, Pseudoscience, Machu Picchu, and The Gemini Program first. "I need to get it together and have some discipline. It's already crowded up there. One or two more tabs, and I won't even be able to see what's what anymore." At press time, Hayes had clicked a link under References and was sucked into an entirely new website.

BREAKING: Mr. Bennington Completely Lost His Shit In 3rd Period
HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, NY — Saying that the U.S. history teacher had freaked out over basically nothing, classroom sources confirmed Monday that Mr. Bennington completely lost his shit in third period. "We were in the middle of a unit on World War II and Kyle was just sort of talking with some friends, and all of a sudden, Mr. Bennington shouted 'For crying out loud, Kyle!' and slammed his fist down really hard on his desk," said student Meredith Lynn, recalling that the normally affable teacher had been so incensed that he even yelled at Julie and Devon who had only been listening to Kyle and hadn't even made a peep. "There was a vein popping out of his forehead, and he goes, 'Get the Hell out of my class' — he actually said 'Hell' — and makes Kyle pack up and leave. And even after he calmed down, it was still super intense. He just had us all read quietly for the rest of the period until the bell rang." At press time, sources reported that Mr. Bennington hadn't yet shown up for his fourth-period class.

Your Horoscopes — Week Of February 4, 2020
You're in for a bit of an adjustment period this week, and for several weeks after that, following which you'll be able to function just as well as a person whose legs aren't on backward. You'll end next week the same way you'll start it: With a desperate all-or-nothing gamble that your crackpot scheme will be able to extinguish the flames. You will finally be reunited with your family when a sudden mudslide exposes their long-buried station wagon. Moses died within sight of his goals after wandering in the desert for 40 years, but you'll beat him to the punch by doing it within seven months. This just might be the year when you stop listening to spurious advice and trusting fate. Remember to keep checking your horoscope to make sure. You'll get to know your town a little better over the next few weeks as you lose your job, get evicted, and wander the streets looking for food and shelter. Sometimes everything seems dark and without hope. When you begin feeling this way, it's important to remember that these are the natural consequences of being realistic. You'll be forced to confront the infinite, the fleeting nature of life and your own mortality next week when, not to put too fine a point on it, you'll pretty much simply die. They say the clothes make the man, but you and your beautiful, understated suits are proof that this is simply not the case. You're finally over your last lover, to the point where you can start reading that book he recommended in which God creates the Earth and stuff. They say you're at the end of your rope and that you should just give up and resign yourself to failure, and they're board-licensed psychiatrists and therapists, so they should know. You'll find to your delight that love at first sight is very real, and to your horror that revulsion and loathing on fifth sight is, too.

You will find yourself lost in a strange new world in which the hairless, vaguely simian natives seem to be trying to communicate with you. Don't worry if you don't understand the complex, yet seemingly effortless, unfolding of the universe. After all, you're stupid. You'll raise self-involvement to new heights by taking the discovery of a new species of insect as a personal affront. The way you relate to others will only be subtly altered by your new habit of carrying a constantly firing Gatling gun under each arm. This week will bring you a healthy, fulfilling romance in the workplace. That will motivate you to get a goddamn job. The siren song of forbidden love will ring in your ears this week when you become sexually attracted to your town's warning klaxon. You'll soon experience redoubled energy, a renewed sense of purpose, and a profound rush of confidence, proving once again that cocaine cannot be trusted. Enough about you. This week, Virgo will be unable to shake the feeling that you never listen to her. You'll discover a great new diet that lets you eat whatever you want while ballooning up to 450 sexy, sexy pounds. It's getting harder for your loved ones to believe that you never have any spare change. The movement of planets in your sign foretells amazing romantic events this week. The stars, however, just pour out endless amounts of electromagnetic radiation.

Pros And Cons Of Bilingual Education
With more than one-fifth of American students speaking a language other than English at home, a number that continues to rise, there's a growing case for bilingual education as a foundational component of the U.S. system; critics, however, maintain that it's unnecessary. The Onion breaks down the pros and cons of bilingual education. Introducing children to irregular conjugations a great way to foster interest in other cultures. Watch Narcos without subtitles. Dazzle potential mates by reciting intricate and profound Hungarian sonnets. Opens up new job opportunities like French barista and German janitor. Gain ability to talk to animals who speak Spanish. Threatens American culture of not knowing jack shit about anything. Can't have your kid being smarter than you. Still going to lose job to robot. Really overestimates average American child. Have to live fuller, more engaged life.

Obsessive-Compulsive Baseball Player Has To Touch All 3 Bases Before Going Home
CINCINNATI — Expressing concern over their teammate's unhealthy fixation on repeating the process, Cincinnati Reds players confirmed Monday that outfielder Phil Ervin always has to touch all three bases before going to home plate. "He just can't go near home plate without first touching every single base in order with his foot — it's a total fixation," said first baseman Joey Votto, recalling a play where Ervin couldn't even sprint to home for a score without first going back to "tag up third base." "I suppose there's nothing wrong with it, but it gets a little awkward when the entire dugout has to wait for him to round the bases before we can congratulate him on his homer." At press time, several teammates approached Ervin on his compulsory habit of wearing the same hat and gloves every game.

"I went up for a rebound and just felt a sharp pain," said the junior shooting guard of the mild ankle sprain sustained in an away game, gripping his crutches tightly and bravely soldiering on as though he were the last surviving member of his battalion in the Korean War. "It's been really tough coming back here like this, but I did what I had to do for my team. Those guys are like my family." At press time, Moore was reportedly overcome with emotion when the basketball team dedicated their season to him.

Authorities On Loudspeaker Plead With Holdout Characters To Evacuate Disney World While They Still Can
ORLANDO, FL — Beseeching those individuals remaining on the premises Wednesday to relocate before Hurricane Irma strikes, local officials reportedly drove down Disney World's Main Street, USA, using vehicle-mounted loudspeakers to plead with any holdout characters to evacuate. "We urge everyone to leave Liberty Square and seek out higher ground immediately as we may not be able to reach you if the Rivers of America flood," said Orange County sheriff Jason Levine through his megaphone as he pulled up alongside a resolute Jiminy Cricket and Buzz Lightyear, who were seen ignoring the warning and continuing to hammer plywood onto the windows of Cinderella's Castle, just two of the several dozen characters who had reportedly decided to hole up throughout the theme park with stockpiles of turkey legs and mouse-ear-shaped ice cream bars in an attempt to ride out the Category 5 storm. "Please leave any glass slippers, sorcerer's hats, and other belongings behind and exit in a quick and orderly fashion. This is for your own safety. Monorails are waiting to evacuate you and your loved ones." When later contacted by police officers going door to door, local dwarf Grumpy told authorities that he and his many relations had lived in Fantasyland for 45 years and were at peace riding out the storm in their small cottage, regardless of what fate awaited them.

High School Nurse Getting Pretty Good At Spotting Morning Sickness
FAIRFIELD, ME―Having seen more students than she can remember come into her office with complaints of nausea and vomiting over the years, Fairfield High School nurse Sarah Bromti told reporters Wednesday she's getting to the point where she can identify morning sickness without much trouble. "I've been at this for a while now, so when a freshman or sophomore walks in during first period with that look on her face, I have a pretty good idea what's going on," said Bromti, noting that most of the time, she's already pulled a teen pregnancy pamphlet out of her desk drawer before the student has even started listing her symptoms. "You see enough queasy ones and eventually you can just pick out which aren't the flu or food poisoning. If a girl comes in here a month or two after the annual ski trip, that's what it is nine times out of 10." At press time, Bromti had cut her time with reporters short because a pale-looking 15-year-old cheerleader was approaching her desk.

10th-Grade Prodigy Studying Mathematics At 10th-Grade Level
ALEXANDRIA, VA — Marveling at his extraordinary proficiency in geometry for someone his age, teachers at T.C. Williams High School told reporters Thursday that local 10th-grade prodigy Michael Greenan is currently studying mathematics at a 10th-grade level. "Michael is a really gifted kid. He's working his way through a sophomore math textbook right now, learning and applying concepts such as the Pythagorean theorem and the Cartesian coordinate system that his fellow 10th-graders can't even begin to comprehend," said Greenan's math teacher, Emily Cress, citing the 16-year-old whiz's impressive understanding of the state-mandated curriculum that is designated appropriate for his age range. "The truth is, he's always had exceptional mathematical abilities. I remember hearing crazy stories years ago about how he passed his eighth-grade placement tests at 13. If he keeps this up, by the end of the year, he could be ready for 11th-grade algebra 2." Cress went on to add that at this rate, the wunderkind will probably graduate from college by the time he's 22.

Nation Prepares For Long Week Of Seeing Photos Of Tom Brady Lifting Super Bowl Trophy
WASHINGTON — Bracing themselves for what they know will be a long and arduous week, millions of Americans across the nation expressed their frustration Tuesday as they prepared to be continuously inundated with photos of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady lifting the Super Bowl trophy. "Well, this is gonna suck," Omaha, NE resident Paul Webb said before opening his web browser, explaining that as soon as he opens any given sports website, he will inevitably be met with a giant picture of Brady holding up the Lombardi Trophy after the Super Bowl or during the Patriots' championship parade. "It'll be really annoying having to immediately scroll down just so I don't have to see that smug asshole's face smiling back at me while he wears a 'Super Bowl XLIX Champions' hat and confetti rains down around him, but I guess I don't have a choice unless I toss my phone in the garbage and go live in the woods for the next seven days. The worst will be those grids of him hoisting four different Super Bowl trophies — Christ, even the thought of that makes me want to fucking puke." The U.S. populace did, however, reportedly take some solace in realizing that the constant barrage of photos and articles about Brady and the Patriots doesn't represent a drastic departure from the media's normal, everyday sports coverage.

Report: High School Marching Band Definitely In Shape Of Something
OAK PARK, IL — Noting that the musicians had left their straight-line formation and stopped very cleanly, sources confirmed Friday that the Fenwick High School marching band was definitely in the shape of something. "I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be, like, a flag or trapezoid, or maybe another type of square-looking shape," said Michelle Carter, 38, squinting her eyes in an effort to discern what the amorphous mass of teenagers assembled at midfield was meant to represent. "Man, I have no idea. It's definitely intentional because they all know their marks and they're all clapping at the same time. Maybe it's the school mascot? Or an amoeba? Eh, I probably just can't tell because I'm not high up enough in the bleachers." At press time, Carter reported that while the band was definitely marching in some kind of almost-recognizable formation, no one had any idea what they were playing.

'I Don't Fit Into Any Of Corporate America's Little Boxes,' Says Single, 18-To-36-Year-Old Hispanic Female With Brand Loyalty To Tom's, Chobani
LOS ANGELES, CA — Declaring herself a unique and sovereign individual who can't be quantified by demographics or pigeonholed by big business, Carla Martín, a single, childless, 18-to-36-year-old bilingual Hispanic female with brand loyalty to Tom's shoes and Chobani Greek yogurt and who expects to take two airline flights in 2018, told reporters Friday that she doesn't fit into any of corporate America's little boxes. "I'm more than just a collection of statistics," said Martín, a college graduate in the $50,000 to $75,000 income bracket who supports center-left political causes, visits the two coffee shops in her neighborhood an average of 2.6 times each per week, prefers but does not exclusively purchase organic food, uses less than 75 percent of the allotted mileage on her leased Volkswagen Passat every month, enjoys listening to Imagine Dragons and Ed Sheeran, is currently in the market for a new floor lamp, and whom algorithms predict has an 89 percent chance of buying the Chelsea Sectional model from Pottery Barn. "You can't put a label on me. I'm a free spirit who will never be a pawn in some big marketing scheme." Martín later headed off to a metalworking class, a new interest of hers that she feels demonstrates her unpredictable personality and was recommended to her by Groupon.

Derek Jeter Admits He Only Plays The Game The Right Way For The Pussy
NEW YORK — New York Yankees shortstop and eventual first-ballot Hall of Famer Derek Jeter admitted to reporters Monday that the only reason he plays baseball with effort, modesty, and reverence to those who played before him is because it gets him all the world-class pussy he can handle. "It's not like I'm faking anything out there; I do genuinely play my hardest each and every night, but I also genuinely love digging balls deep into women like Minka Kelly, and I'd be lying if I told you those two things aren't related," said Jeter, adding that charity work and appearances at fundraisers are another sure-fire way to "line up the juicy wet love gloves. " "In 2004, when I dove into those stands and busted up my face, the whole time I was running toward that ball I was thinking to myself, 'Threesome!!'" When asked for his opinion, Jeter's teammate Alex Rodriguez acknowledged that pussy is the only reason he acts like an arrogant asshole who's too good for everyone he meets.

"He's just crippling this team right now," said an anonymous Yankee player, speaking in muffled, barely audible tones. "We've all felt it, and each day is getting worse and worse. Guys are awfully demoralized and some are clearly giving up. This really hurts. I've never seen the Yankees in such a bad place." At press time, Yankees players confirmed that Sabathia was crushing their hopes of surviving until the postseason.

Derek Jeter Denies Tanking Allegations After Marlins Field 4 Players
MIAMI — Affirming his commitment to field the best possible lineup, Miami Marlins owner and CEO Derek Jeter denied tanking allegations this week after the team fielded just four players in a loss to the Phillies. "I know people aren't happy with our performance, but just because we didn't have a shortstop, second baseman, third baseman, right fielder, or left fielder playing last night doesn't mean we aren't trying to compete every game," said Jeter, who promised that having a one-man rotation after cutting and trading away every other pitcher on the roster gives the Marlins the best chance to win. "I expect this team to contend — I don't care if we haven't held a single practice or team workout in the past four months. All 16 remaining Marlins employees are working hard for the success of this franchise." Jeter added that the recent decision to replace Don Mattingly with a dry-erase board had nothing to do with saving money.

NEW YORK — While warming up on the Yankee Stadium sidelines before Tuesday's game, Alex Rodriguez paused, looked up at the clear blue sky and the thousands of cheering fans in attendance, turned to Derek Jeter, and invoked a classic line from the 1989 film Field Of Dreams. "Hey, Derek?" Rodriguez said, inhaling deeply to convey a sense of wonderment and gesturing woodenly to the thick, green grass below his feet. "Is this heaven? " According to witnesses, Jeter chuckled mildly and then muttered "Fucking loser" under his breath.

Fair-Weather Bills Fan Not Even Banned From Stadium
BUFFALO — Bragging about his own hardcore dedication to being removed from sports facilities, local fan Rob Henderson reportedly questioned Sunday how his acquaintance Derek Shaw could possibly call himself a fan of the Buffalo Bills if he had never been banned from entering New Era Field. "Listen, I've been banned from this place since it was called Rich Stadium, and this guy comes in saying he's had a 'seat' inside there for every game the past two years? Who does he think he is?" said Shaw, ranting that he was tired of dealing with bandwagon fans who had never even gotten ejected for fighting by the concession stands, throwing up on their neighbor, or shouting racist epithets at players. "If you can make it through 10 straight Bills games and not get permanently barred from entering the field and parking lot, I just don't think you really love this team. It's in my blood. My father lost his season tickets, my grandpa lost his season tickets, and one day, God willing, I'll get to see my son get chased down by security, blind drunk and half-nude. Can he say the same? Poser." At press time, Shaw was showing off his Bills fan bona fides by watching the game on his phone in the backseat of his car after getting kicked out of a local sports bar.

Tony Romo Confident Bruised Ribs Won't Hurt His Performance In Upcoming Ballet Recital
DALLAS — Despite suffering several bruised ribs during last weekend's 36-31 victory over the New York Giants, Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo told reporters Friday that the injury will in no way hinder his performance in an upcoming recital of Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. "I might not be 100 percent by the opening scene, but it shouldn't affect my pirouetting motion at all, or my ability to plié and hit a grand jeté at full speed," said Romo, adding that while he has experienced some soreness in recent days, any discomfort will "absolutely not" diminish his role as Odette, Queen of the Swans. "Look, these things happen during ballet season. It's been feeling better during rehearsal, so I'll definitely be out there for all four acts this Saturday night. Sometimes you have to just dance through the pain, because at the end of the day, it's all about the ensemble." Romo did confirm, however, that he plans to wear a brace underneath his bodice to protect his ribcage while being lifted into the air.

NFL Announcer Better Hurry The Fuck Up Congratulating Producer On New Baby And Get Back To Game
GREEN BAY, WI — Noting with urgency that play was about to resume after a brief timeout on the field, sources confirmed Sunday that CBS announcer Jim Nantz better hurry the fuck up congratulating one of the broadcast's producers on his new baby and get back to the Packers-Texans game. "Okay, he had a baby — good for him — but there's a football game happening right now that I'd like to actually watch," said 33-year-old viewer Chuck Prescott of Beaumont, TX, adding that Nantz and commentator Phil Simms had already wasted enough goddamn time showing pictures of the longtime producer's newborn daughter onscreen as they welcomed "the newest member of the CBS Sports family." "I can still hear the crowd in the background, so they need to get their asses in gear and put the game back on, because I better not miss a big play for this shit. Why couldn't they have just done this at halftime?" At press time, the Packers had converted on third-and-long while Nantz and Simms were droning on about their support and best wishes for some fucking sound technician who is currently undergoing treatment for cancer.

NFL To Curb Excessive Celebrations By Removing Areas Of Players' Brains Responsible For Emotions
NEW YORK — Stressing that the league will take a hard-line stance when enforcing its policy for on-field conduct, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced plans Thursday to curb any prolonged or excessive touchdown celebrations by removing the areas of players' brains responsible for emotions. "In order to prevent any future incidents of unsportsmanlike behavior, we will be forcing every player to undergo a roughly 14-hour surgical procedure that will remove all parts of the cerebrum that correspond to experiencing feelings of any kind," said Goodell, adding that in order to comply with rules regarding acceptable celebrations, players will no longer be permitted to possess the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, or cingulate gyrus in their limbic systems beginning in week 15 of the regular season. "We're confident that by surgically excising the neurological structures that allow players to feel joy, excitement, relief, pleasure, or any other emotion, our athletes will conduct themselves properly and represent their teams, the league, and the sport of football in the best manner possible." At press time, the Pittsburgh Steelers confirmed that due to a serious surgical complication, star wide receiver Antonio Brown has been left in a permanent vegetative state.

For Its 33rd Year, OGN Adamantly Refuses To Report On The Pinball Expo 'Flip Out' Tournament Or Any Pinball-Related News
Since its inception, the Onion Gamers Network has prided itself on being the number-one source for all gaming-related news, bringing our readers the latest stories and updates from major players like Microsoft and Nintendo, as well as minor but noteworthy releases from a host of independent developers. In short, we have striven to cover every corner of the gaming world. What we have not done, and will never do, is report on the Chicago Pinball Expo's signature competitive event or any news whatsoever pertaining to pinball, which we do not consider to be a game but rather a misbegotten abomination. We have remained steadfast in this strategy to counter pinball's rise throughout our publication's tenure. For example, in 1943, as the nation was swept by suspicion of the so-called "Flipper Menace," the original OGN editors bravely refused to comment in any way upon its existence, lest they risk lending legitimacy to the absurd and pointless exercise of hitting a metal marble through a series of bumpers. Likewise, in 1978, we cheered as heroic inventors created video games, pushing out the blight of pinball machines that merely confused our senses, deafened our children, and took up precious floor space in our country's arcades. Soon thereafter, however, the unimaginable struck: In the mid-'80s, a group of shortsighted and arrogant pinball aficionados resurrected a hobby that unquestionably should have been left dead, enshrining one of history's greatest mistakes of all time in the form of the Chicago Pinball Expo. Like a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah, they drew in scores and scores of innocent players and converted them to their twisted and perverse bumper-and-plunger-based worldview. Many urged us to investigate this gathering and its sick "Flip Out" pinball competition, arguing that our sterling reportage could educate these poor pinball fanatics about the error of their ways. But our editors were all too aware that their souls were already lost, ruined forever by the seductive treachery of the ball bearing. Our firm anti-pinball commitment remained unshakable then, as it has to this day. Indeed, the publication of this article constitutes the first and final use of the word "pinball" in our publication's history. We felt that this extraordinary editorial decision was necessary after decades of ignorant or brainwashed gamers demanding coverage of the event. For the edification of our readers, we would like to take this opportunity to publicly enumerate our longstanding journalistic practices regarding pinball: First and foremost, we will never cover pinball. This includes any tournaments, expositions, or events of any kind, as well as technological advances, trends in the community, interviews with "luminaries" in the field, or any other story whatsoever touching on the subject of pinball. In addition, we will never cover any pinball-derived video games such as 1995's Full Tilt! Pinball or 1999's Pokémon Pinball. We consider these to be little more than a cheap canard by pinball apologists to trick us into covering their sick obsession. We will not fall for it. We also regard all individuals who are known to engage in this pastime, or have close family members that do, as worthy of suspicion. We will always use extreme discretion when quoting them as a source and ensure that all their statements are subject to a thorough fact-checking before publication. For this reason, our ban on Pete Townshend for his musical promotion of this repugnant pinball lifestyle will never be lifted. Finally, we would like to reassure readers that our long-running and award-winning coverage on the worldwide pachinko phenomenon will continue unabated. We hope this lays the matter to rest once and for all. Signed, Onion Gamers Network Editorial Board

Every American Should Be Extremely Unsettled By The Initiatives Trump's Cabinet Is Pursuing
The documents referred to in this editorial are part of a trove of classified files provided to The Onion by an anonymous whistleblower in the White House. All of these documents can be found here. As soon as Donald Trump won the presidency last November, it became clear to every editor, journalist, and indentured Laotian typesetter at The Onion that we would soon be contending with an unorthodox administration. Now, as our employees ceaselessly analyze a vast trove of classified White House documents on ocean barges floating outside the jurisdiction of the Fair Labor Standards Act, we are finding ample evidence that the path being pursued by this president and his cabinet is, as anticipated, startlingly unlike any other in history. In fact, every American should cower in fear at what we have uncovered. While it is evident to even a casual political observer that the Trump administration is determined to reverse numerous Obama-era norms and regulations, the precise details of such efforts are particularly shocking. Notably, we have obtained evidence that the Department of Homeland Security is moving to reauthorize enhanced interrogation techniques for suspected terrorists, illegal immigrants, and the White House Press Corps. According to the highly classified material in our possession, the federal government plans to circumvent the Geneva Conventions by detaining these individuals within a timeless, lightless extra-dimensional realm known as The Void, where prisoners can be deprived of sleep for up to 40,000 years at a time and forced to watch their families grow old and die across billions of alternate universes. The new administration is also poised to discontinue Obama-era green energy initiatives and return the nation to a greater reliance on fossil fuels, which could have dire implications for every citizen of this nation. Specifically, Energy Secretary Rick Perry delivered a classified presentation to the president in April addressing the nation's energy crisis, noting forebodingly that "human bodies are made of carbon which can become oil" and that "there are over 320 million sources of oil in the U.S. today." At present, it appears the Energy Department is piloting a "carceral production plan" to tap this new source of fuel as soon as possible. The ecosystem also appears to be at serious risk under this cabinet, based on the presentation that Administrator Scott Pruitt delivered to the president in March outlining the Environmental Protection Agency's objectives and goals for the next four years. Furthermore, Pruitt himself confirmed he is actively subverting his own agency's efforts to protect the environment in a series of updates he sent to the White House regarding the progress he was making in destroying his office with a hammer. It should be noted that the decisions now being made in Washington are not only placing the future of the planet in peril, but also the future of our nation's children. According to The Onion's analysis, the only effort Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has so far made to bolster the public school curriculum was her recommendation to instate a nationwide after-school polo program for underserved students, which she claimed would "instill important skills like leadership and field etiquette into these kids that they will need later in life." Additionally, the sole memo she has thus far issued in office was titled "Addressing The Growing Trend Of Students Drawing Dongs In Textbooks," which decried the negative learning conditions that result when children encounter a variety of hand-drawn dongs — from large dongs, to curved dongs, to dongs with excessive curly black hair — throughout the pages of their course books. While DeVos' initiatives raise serious and troubling questions, perhaps no cabinet member's behavior is more perplexing than that of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. According to a strange, rambling presentation delivered in February, Carson warned the Oval Office that his agency was unable to "translate the language spoken by ranch houses," that skyscrapers "have threatened to get even taller," and that some vague but menacing figure known as "Grathshashon" had "returned." Carson's bizarre beliefs were no further clarified in a series of emails to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, in which he attempted to persuade his fellow cabinet member to sign a treaty bringing an end to the "senseless war between houses and cars." Even more puzzling, though, was a series of urgent emails that Carson sent to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus on February 28 in which he stated that he had become trapped in his email and could not find his way out. Such peculiar and unsettling behavior appears to be pervasive throughout the president's cabinet. The Department of Health and Human Services, for instance, compiled a disconcerting list of alternatives to Obamacare for the president to look over, which included such options as conscripting all citizens into the military and raising the price of specialist visits to $158,000 apiece. Moreover, the nation's new secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, signaled a sharp turn from the diplomacy pursued under the Obama administration by issuing a memo laying out an ambitious slate of new global initiatives, ranging from "working to restore American-sponsored coups to pre-1990 levels" to having the United States create a "new catastrophic power vacuum somewhere else in [the] world to take pressure off [the] Middle East." Additional documents showed that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin tried to personally redesign U.S. currency as he saw fit. In an email to a colleague regarding the new $20 bills that feature an image of Harriet Tubman, Mnuchin asked if there was "any way we can get someone like Dwight Eisenhower or General MacArthur on there instead?" and proceeded to list off dozens of other individuals, from James K. Polk to Milton Friedman, whom he considered more deserving of adorning U.S. money. Given the nation's deepening concerns about the commander in chief's impartiality and fitness to lead, it would be heartening to know that the individuals around him — the heads of the various executive departments who are charged with carrying out the many functions of the federal government — were making sound decisions in our nation's best interest. However, the documents obtained by The Onion cast serious doubt on this hopeful notion. What is certain is that each and every one of us will face dire challenges in the four years ahead, whether by entering a diminished health care or education system, being processed into oil, or succumbing to an uncontrollable Superfund site that has gained sentience and begun swallowing our local communities whole.

Cowboys Award 6-Year, $108 Million Extension To Super Bowl–Watching Quarterback Tony Romo
IRVING, TX — In an effort to prevent the multiple championship–viewing player from reaching free agency, the Dallas Cowboys announced this week that the team had signed Super Bowl–watching quarterback Tony Romo to a six-year, $108 million contract extension. "Tony has already watched seven Super Bowls for us," said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who acknowledged that the most lucrative contract in team history will put extra pressure on Romo to continue watching championships. "He was born to watch the Super Bowl, he's proven himself capable of it, and we are confident that the next few years will see Tony Romo watch many, many more Super Bowls as a Dallas Cowboy." Jones added that a major focus for the team this season will be on keeping Tony Romo healthy so that he can watch the entire 2014 playoffs.

'The Onion' Vows To Carry On Iran's Nuclear Weapons Program Until The Job Is Done
Yesterday, a group of high-ranking world leaders met in Geneva and brokered a six-month deal to limit the nuclear ambitions of the Islamic Republic of Iran. These spineless Western autocrats did so in exchange for the removal of several economic sanctions on Iran, believing they have both the power and authority to dismantle the country's nuclear program and enforce strict IAEA regulations on uranium enrichment. Given this incredibly unjust though unsurprising meddling from these cowardly foreign governments, The Onion vows to continue the expansion of Iran's nuclear weapons program for as long as necessary until the operation has been completed. The dream must live on and will live on. And The Onion will make sure it does. Perhaps these so-called international superpowers thought The Onion would simply forget the promise we made to the great and wise Ayatollah Khomeini on that snowy December night in 1983. Perhaps they thought The Onion would lie down and do nothing as one of its greatest allies is targeted with disgraceful, unwarranted regulations and blatant subversion from foreign enemies. If that is truly what these tyrannical diplomats assumed, they will soon realize they were gravely, gravely mistaken. Rest assured, The Onion keeps its promises. The Onion guarantees in no uncertain terms that Iran's nuclear development will continue as planned, with no delays or downturn whatsoever. In fact, in light of these recent events in Geneva, not only will we deliver on the original terms of our arrangement, but we will also redouble our efforts and promise you this, in no uncertain terms: Iran will, Insha'Allah, have the greatest, most devastating nuclear arsenal the world has ever seen within 12 months' time. Iran, you may be bound by trade sanctions, by the whims of international politics and autocratic despots who operate under the guise of diplomacy, but we are not. The Onion answers to no such authorities. Indeed, if any international party attempts to halt, impede, or so much as inspect one of The Onion's uranium enrichment facilities, we will have another 10 such facilities up and running within 30 minutes. And should any coalition forces even attempt to shut down one of The Onion's nuclear reactors, we will immediately initiate the Gamma Protocol. To demonstrate our unflinching commitment to the future of your nuclear program, The Onion has outlined a simple six-step plan to ensure your offensive arsenal will continue its expansion on schedule: These steps will be executed with the highest of standards, and anyone who stands in the way of Iran's nuclear ambitions — which, by virtue of our strong and long-lasting alliance, are also the ambitions of The Onion — will be swiftly dealt with by any means necessary. Take heart, Iranian brothers. The Onion is here for you, always. 11/25/13 4:05PM•SEE MORE: News As you know, The Onion is already in possession of 38 fully operational nuclear reactors on five continents. Consider them yours. An additional 30,000 workers have been hired to quicken the pace of uranium enrichment and to operate our growing stockpile of Zippe and SILEX centrifuges. Furthermore, 15 of the world's leading nuclear physicists have been abducted and put to work on nuclear arms development projects for the Iranian military. The K-47 fission reactor has now been commissioned and is rapidly enriching weapons-grade nuclear materials at this very moment. As of 9:00 GMT, construction has begun on our new state-of-the-art underground Tetraplex Nuclear Generating Station, expected to be completed by March 2014. Again, this will be at your full disposal once construction has finished. Through the movement of several considerable offshore holdings, The Onion has set aside roughly $750 billion to be fully invested in new and completely undetectable nuclear facilities for the Iranian government. The Onion has already procured through various means 46,000 tons of fully enriched weapons-grade uranium, 90 nuclear warheads, and 17 long-range missile launching mechanisms. These assets are available to the Iranian government at any time and are ready to be put to use at a moment's notice.

The Onion Humbly Offers Up Its Offices To Imprison The Women Who Have Wrongfully Accused Donald Trump
In recent weeks, a dozen women have come forward alleging that presidential nominee Donald J. Trump made unwanted sexual advances on them. Each of these accusers has operated, seemingly in collusion, with the sole intention of spreading outrageous falsehoods to undermine a man of great esteem and resources. Not only has this rank slander dealt a grievous blow to Mr. Trump's reputation, but the words of these women have stained America's legacy of fair and respectable electoral politics, and we at this newspaper can no longer stand idly by while such brazen and criminal defamation goes unpunished. It is with this in mind that the editorial board of The Onion has unanimously voted, with all due humility, to offer up our offices to imprison the women who have wrongfully assailed Mr. Trump's honor and good name. We urge the public to recall that Mr. Trump is not only a globally successful businessman with a net worth in the billions of dollars, but also an aspirant to this nation's highest office. As such, these accusations — all of them libelous and wildly defamatory — stand to profoundly erode his stature in the public eye at this critical juncture in the election cycle, which is why those responsible must be made an example of. Moving with all due haste to incarcerate these women within The Onion's detention cells would, in our opinion, put a swift and resounding end to their present smear campaign and further act to dissuade future maligners from coming forward. Indeed, even if Mr. Trump did commit an act or two of those which he has been accused, shouldn't his immense prestige give him license to make a mistake here or there without it tarnishing his character and jeopardizing his chances at elected office? The editorial board of this newspaper has taken the liberty of readying a private security unit to find these women wherever they may be hiding, apprehend them with all necessary force, and remove them from the society that they, through their cowardly actions, have forfeited their right to be a part of. We ask only for the assent of Mr. Trump himself. We recognize that the Trump campaign may have questions about The Onion's prison facilities and whether the conditions within them will be sufficiently isolating and punitive in light of the egregious character assaults these women have leveled against the Republican candidate. The editors of this newspaper would like to assure Mr. Trump and his staff that The Onion takes incarceration very seriously. Indeed, our detainment complex is recognized as one of the world's premier black sites for extraordinary rendition by many foreign intelligence agencies, and we presently confine hundreds of dissidents and activists on behalf of our government partners in North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, and elsewhere. Allow us to further assuage any doubts by elaborating on the conditions these liars and conspirators can expect while imprisoned within our headquarters: If the potential for escape is a reason for concern, Mr. Trump, rest assured that The Onion has operated private correctional facilities since the Spanish-American War, when we successfully detained the most violent and wily of Spaniards, and not a single prison break has ever been successfully orchestrated from our confines. For more than 100 years, The Onion's prisons have held the most cunning inmates, ranging from French traitor Alfred Dreyfus, to the seditious operatives exposed by Sen. Joseph McCarthy, to Salman Rushdie. We would warmly welcome the addition of these women who have so contemptibly borne false witness against a political standard-bearer and American icon. Indeed, even if Mr. Trump did commit an act or two of those which he has been accused, shouldn't his immense prestige give him license to make a mistake here or there without it tarnishing his character and jeopardizing his chances at elected office? We most certainly believe so. It is The Onion's firm conviction that in order for civility in our republic to endure, those seeking to lead the people must be freed from fear of scurrilous aspersions that threaten the very governance of our nation. Only through vigilant prosecution and punishment of those responsible for impugning Donald J. Trump's character can we secure this noble aim. Anything less would be a dishonor to the very tenets upon which this newspaper was founded. Mr. Trump, we await your permission to incarcerate these deceitful women. It would be our distinct privilege. 10/25/16 1:30PM•SEE MORE: Opinion Each woman will be housed in one of the 1,500 detainment chambers situated in 12 tiers between floors 92 and 104 of our office tower, likely in cell blocks 1-B or 3-F, which have been newly vacated following recent liquidation orders from the Chinese Standing Committee.

"But we just can't overlook this latest offense. Even if he's the only one who knows where the spare USB cables are.

Tony Romo Realizes He Should Have Used Ability To Read Defenses Back When He Was Still Playing
ATLANTA — Admitting that relying on the skill set was fairly obvious in hindsight, CBS commentator Tony Romo realized Friday that he probably should have used his ability to read defenses back when he was still playing. "Aw, jeez, you know, being able to determine whether the secondary was staying in man or dropping into zone would have been super helpful back when I was under center," said Romo, who acknowledged for the first time that his aptitude for identifying blitz packages and dissecting coverage schemes would likely have improved his play at quarterback. "Honestly, it's kind of a shame I didn't take the things I learned from watching all those hours of tape and apply them to the actual games — because it turns out, knowing exactly what the other team is going to do is a pretty big advantage. Gosh, I probably could have even avoided a bunch of those sacks and injuries that forced me into early retirement." Romo added that in retrospect, it easily could have been him catching Patriots cornerback Jason McCourty without safety help over-the-top on the second play from scrimmage next week.

New Alternate-Reality Series Puts 12 Strangers On Island Where South Won Civil War
LOS ANGELES — CBS executives announced Monday that they have begun filming Antebellum Island, a new "alternate reality" series in which 12 strangers compete for $1 million while isolated on an island still under Confederate rule. "Set to air in the spring of 2004, Antebellum Island gives us the unique opportunity to play with both social dynamics and recorded history," CBS Chairman Leslie Moonves said. "The contestants on Antebellum Island will spend 60 days braving the elements, each other, and the unfamiliar customs and practices of a 21st-century Confederate States of America — all for a chance to win a cool million. Added Moonves: "That's one million in Union dollars, of course! Moonves said contestants will be isolated on a sun-drenched tropical island, where they will participate in competitions designed to emphasize teamwork and interpersonal friction in the rigidly stratified alternate-universe society. The Big Four networks have seen dwindling Nielsen numbers for variations on reality shows, a trend CBS hopes to reverse with a new genre of programs that "go beyond reality. "When we were brainstorming this show, we knew we wanted an eclectic cast and an exotic locale," said Matt Davies, executive producer of Antebellum Island. "But none of the ideas were clicking as 'reality plus totally new' — until someone said, 'Hey, no one's done a show set in an America where the Union army lost, and Jefferson Davis replaced Lincoln as president.' We knew we had a winner. Davies said CBS also seriously considered another alternate-reality series called The Man In The High Castle In The Outback, in which 12 women would compete for the love of a Jewish man hiding in Australia under an assumed name because the Allies lost WWII to Nazi Germany. Ultimately, executives deemed the scenario less likely to engage the average American viewer than the post-Civil-War alternate reality. Scouts chose a tropical location after they failed to find an island in the Mississippi River with enough land mass to sustain the manufacturing-based economy of a country that did not begin its transition from an agricultural society to a modern industrial society until the early 1900s. "It's a totally new and exciting location," Davies said. "Our 12 strangers must adapt to the altogether-unfamiliar territory of an island where the states and the people are guaranteed those rights not specifically delegated to the federal government! Contestant auditions for Antebellum Island were held in Washington, DC, and Richmond, VA. Interviewees were asked such questions as: "Do you consider yourself fun-loving and up for new challenges? " "Do you believe women should be given the vote? " and "Do you reckon Dred Scott shoulda been hung from the highest tree? "We have a good mix of people for our first cast — all colors and creeds," Davies said. "On this show, as you might imagine, diversity is especially crucial. We plan to break the participants into two 'families,' the Masons and the Dixons." "In casting the show, we looked for people who displayed adaptability, good judgment, and impeccable hospitality," Davies said. "But we wanted to let the contestants' personalities shape the show. We didn't just look to fill the typical slots: plantation owner, houseboy, carpetbagger, and Uncle Tom." Executives were reluctant to reveal the themes for Antebellum's weekly competitions, but said contests might include skeet shooting, quilting bees, formal-dress cotillions, and working at a textile factory on the west side of the island for the entire show's duration with no chance at the $1 million prize. Davies said the show's first episode will feature an adventure-filled whitewater-rafting trip, in which one team will attempt to make it to the "New Orleans Checkpoint," while the other will try to stop it from meeting up with the British ships in port and demanding asylum. "We've thought a lot about how contestants should be kicked off the island," Davies said. "The voting thing has been done to death, and anyway, on our island, voting is a very touchy subject. Right now, we're toying with allowing cast members to just escape to the North. But it might be neat to choreograph some sort of mad uprising for the final episode. Whatever we do, you can bet it'll be exciting, tension-filled, and consistent with an America where slavery and states' rights survived long after the 1860s."

Elon Musk Insists He'd Be Much More Innovative Pedophile Than Thailand Rescue Worker
PALO ALTO, CA — Doubling down on a recent controversial statement he made about a British cave diver who helped free a youth soccer team from a cave in Thailand, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly insisted Monday that he would be a much more innovative pedophile than rescue worker Vernon Unsworth. "Look, the only insulting thing I was trying to say when I called that guy a pedo was that he represents a laughably simplistic, outdated form of child molesting that is badly in need of disruption from Silicon Valley leaders like myself," said Musk in a Twitter thread, expressing confidence that he could develop a state-of-the-art, bleeding-edge system for pederasty that would dwarf anything that a conventional "luddite" like Unsworth could even imagine. "I'm not saying I'm going to molest children, but if I did, you'd better believe it would be with a system that would save you the long, time-consuming, and expensive trips to Thailand like this guy takes, one that can deliver attractive Thai youths right to your door. Rest assured that if I wanted to, I could build a scalable global network using the most advanced artificial-intelligence technology to offer maximum efficiency, variety, and convenience to deviants and sickos anywhere in the world." At press time, a new company Musk launched to build a more innovative system for pedophilia was already valued at $18 billion.

Democrat Party: Moving Left Vs. Remaining Moderate
As the Democratic presidential primaries heat up and the party hopes to defeat President Trump in 2020, fierce debate has raged about whether it should stake out more left-wing political positions or remain moderate. The Onion breaks down what's at stake in the debate over the Democratic Party's future. Moving Left: Replace with Medicare for all Remaining Moderate: It's unrealistic to believe we can fight death Moving Left: Respect other nations' right to self-determination Remaining Moderate: 10% less than whatever Dick Cheney would do Moving Left: "I Donated" bumper sticker Remaining Moderate: Ambassadorship to Andorra Moving Left: Diver Down Remaining Moderate: 1984 Moving Left: The free market shows no signs of solving this problem Remaining Moderate: Yeah, but it still might Moving Left: Reform-based Remaining Moderate: Résumé-based Moving Left: When the brazen, uncontrollable Trump administration tosses bricks into the windows of international business, it can't expect tangible results Remaining Moderate: We should be doing this to Russia instead Moving Left: Rich individuals pay more Remaining Moderate: I am rich Moving Left: Pro Remaining Moderate: Pro Moving Left: Does everyone think he's just going to leave if a Democrat wins? Remaining Moderate: Seriously, these people really think he's just going to say, "Oh, okay, time to leave," and just waltz out of there? Get real.

What To Expect In The Second Democratic Debates
The second round of the Democratic Party 2020 primary debates will feature the top 20 presidential candidates over two nights in Detroit. The Onion takes a look at what viewers should be watching for in the second Democratic debates. Bernie Sanders stuttering response after briefly forgetting who economy rigged against. More intimate feel with one large family-style podium. Marianne Williamson following up previous debate by absolutely tearing New Zealand a new one. Generally joyless affair without affable, energizing presence of Eric Swalwell. $3.50 Miller Lites and $1 hot dogs. Several excruciating moments of Joe Biden gathering himself. CNN scheduling error on second night leading to Steve Bullock being only candidate onstage. The same hundred words Andrew Yang memorized for the first debate. Julián Castro demanding to know what the fuck happened to all his buzz. Overall, probably less entertaining and informative than whatever TBS plans on showing.

Mysterious Salem Shopkeeper Offers Seth Moulton Chance At Presidential Debate Stage But At A Terrible Cost
SALEM, MA — After wandering through his home district into a dim and dingy store he could have sworn had been an empty alleyway, Representative Seth Moulton (D-MA) was reportedly offered a chance to participate in the upcoming CNN presidential debate Tuesday by a mysterious shopkeeper who warned that the privilege would come at a terrible price. "Ah, Mr. Moulton, you strike me as a man of great ambition — perhaps there's something among my wares that could help you achieve your most cherished desire, hmm?" said the old and withered proprietor, proffering a series of items to the congressman as her eyes reportedly glimmered with mischief. "This lavalier microphone will let you be the greatest public speaker there ever was, though you may find that the words you're saying aren't always your own. Or maybe you'd be interested in this American flag pin — it will energize your base by a hundredfold, yet for its last owner, being forever surrounded by obsessed, adoring fans was more than he bargained for. Nothing for nothing, Mr. Moulton, and everything in its time." At press time, a thrilled Moulton was leaving the shop clutching a necktie guaranteed to give him fame while ignoring the shopkeeper's veiled admonishment that its wearer would ultimately be doomed to a life of political obscurity.

Sun Goes Out For A Few Seconds
TUCSON, AZ — Officials at the Kitt Peak National Observatory are saying that, while the short period of utter darkness and intense cold was distressing, there is "no immediate cause for alarm" over the sun's six-second outage Monday. "We're not sure what caused our sun, which is in essence a self-sustaining fusion reaction, to defy science and just go out for a moment like that, but I wouldn't worry too much," astronomer Stephen Pompea said. "There is a slight chance it could repeat, like sunspot activity, a more common — whup! There it goes again. You seeing this? Kind of weird how it — okay, back on. " Observatory personnel said they would give their full attention to investigating the phenomenon as soon as they figure out why last night's moon was blood red and took up half the sky.

Totally Hot Chick Also Way Psycho
ATHENS, GA — Heather Blake, a University of Georgia business major with unbelievably beautiful eyes and a totally killer body, is also way psycho, sources close to the popular 21-year-old reported Monday. "Heather's this weirdo combination of incredible love goddess and, like, freako banshee demon from beyond hell," said Georgia senior Brad Carver, who noted that he has been there, man, been there. "She made my freshman year a complete and total living nightmare. I made out with her once behind the stairs in the Physical Science Building. It was the single greatest moment of my life. Campus-wide sources said the amazingly hot Blake, who works at the reception desk in the bursar's office, isn't just built like, kapow, but also has the most incredible, luscious hair ever. "That one really hot chick from the bursar's office is way fucked in the head and everybody knows it," junior Steve Bittan said. "Don't even start with her, no matter how bad you want to. According to Bittan, Blake gets all pissed off if someone is staring at her, but she goes out of her way to make searing, prolonged eye contact with anyone who doesn't. "Blake The Flake, they call her," Bittan said. "I once saw her in a bikini. Oh, God, I won't even go into it. Though Blake has never been diagnosed with a mental illness, the increasing number of reports since her arrival on campus in 1996 have caused her sanity to be called into question. "That chick has a weird history, man. She's bad news, plain and simple," said Matt Weiler, 21, who went on a date with Blake two years ago. "I think she might have one of those attention-seeking disorders or like an inability to grasp reality or something like that. "Shit, I've got to talk to her again, if only to hear her voice," Weiler added. "You know, she called me her soulmate for life on that night we were together. Sophomore Dave Elgin said that on May 22, he spent over four hours fixing Blake's car, only to be told afterwards that it really meant a lot to her because the car was "a gift from a very special guy" with whom she really thought she might be falling in love. Blake then told him she wasn't sure she could ever really love the other man fully, however, after meeting someone as kind and generous as Elgin. Other evidence of Blake's psycho mental status includes a June 3 incident in which she stayed up until 4 a.m. curled up against senior Rob Pollian on his couch, telling him all her sexual fantasies, only to become enraged when he attempted to kiss her. A number of individuals within the desperately-trying-to-make-it-with-Heather-Blake community have even suggested that she ought to be locked up or something for all the shit she's done. According to Bryce Meyers, 22, Blake told him last November that he was the last guy on Earth she'd ever want to go out with "because she would never want to hurt anyone so important to her," right before kissing him and running out of the room. "I couldn't believe the kind of crap she pulled," Meyers said. "When she was doing a semester abroad in Spain, we were on the phone constantly, and I ran up this humongous phone bill talking about how I was going to come visit her over winter break. She was all like, 'I can't wait to be near you,' and 'I need to feel you close to me.' Then, when I show up in Madrid, she meets me at the airport and says, 'I'd like to introduce you to my boyfriend Carlos.' I'm standing there thinking, 'Well, Christ, man, who the fuck is Carlos?'" As so many others have, Meyers forgave Blake because of her mental condition. "She's crazy, man. What can you do? " Meyers said. "You know, Heather used to tell me that it's really hard for her just to be happy some days. I guess it totally sucks being so beautiful because of all the expectations that are placed on you. According to those close to Blake, the link between her mind-blowing good looks and out-of-her-tree psycho head trips is undeniable. "Heather's just totally got everybody in the palm of her hand," said Ryan McEachern, a friend of Blake's since high school. "Obviously, having everybody always wanting her so bad has, like, screwed with her self-esteem and shit. But maybe if she just met a guy who understood the real person underneath the beauty, she could straighten out her head. I wonder if that man could be me. Blake could not be reached for comment regarding the possibility of a relationship with McEachern, as her answering machine just kept picking up for hours even though she said she would be home, leading to speculation that she might be with that one guy from the rowing team.

Kyrie Irving Debuts Signature Shoe Inspired By RFID Chips Government Secretly Implants In Anesthetized Patients
BEAVERTON, OR — Claiming he wanted a sneaker that reflected his deepest passions, NBA star Kyrie Irving held a press conference Friday to debut his new Nike Kyrie 7 signature shoe, modeled after the RFID chips the government implants in the brains of every citizen who gets anesthetized. "I really wanted a design that speaks to how the government is slowly taking over our minds through intrusive thoughts that are telegraphed into our brains with implanted microchips," said the Nets point guard, who revealed that engineers worked around the clock testing the hidden GPS tracker in the sole, which monitors not only the wearer's locations but all their vital signs and transmits the information back to Nike headquarters. "Every single shoe has a small interior inscription of the all-seeing eye, surrounded by the Valos Council's signature phrase 'Sumus Ubique.' I just hope kids will wear this shoe and get a little understanding of the forces that control our every action without us even knowing." At press time, the success of the shoe had inspired Irving to explore similar sponsorships, including a Gatorade-brand chemtrail athletic mist and warm-up gear modeled after the flight attendant uniforms on Malaysian Airlines Flight 370.

Bunch Of Numbers From Where Daddy Works Means No Trip To Disney World
RED OAK, MI — Six-year-old Kevin Bligh confirmed Friday that the papers Daddy brings home from work with all the numbers on them mean there will be no trip to Disney World this year after all. "The numbers are mean because they make Daddy sad sometimes," said Bligh, who drew a picture of a crying Mickey Mouse and an angry Daddy, who was holding up a paper with red-colored numbers on them. "And Mommy and Daddy always wave the number papers around when they're yelling. Sometimes Daddy just sits at the kitchen table and stares at the numbers while he drinks from his brown bottle." Although the first-grader told reporters that Daddy hugs him tightly at bedtime and promises everything's going to be all right, Bligh said he's pretty sure Daddy is lying to him.

Corporate Lawyer Achieves Career Masterpiece With McDonald's Monopoly Contest Rules
CHICAGO — Reflecting on what would surely be one day considered his crowning professional accomplishment, corporate lawyer Connor Renaldi announced Wednesday that he had achieved a career masterpiece in finally completing the infallible, ironclad rules to McDonald's Monopoly contest. "This has been my magnum opus, and now I've finally reached my apex," a visibly satisfied Renaldi told reporters, recounting his tireless efforts in devising stratagems to incentivize the purchase of multiple game tiles while preventing customers from winning anything more than a free small fry or fountain drink. "I can go no further in my compiling of the rules and regulations of this sweepstakes; I believe no man can. I've thought of every eventuality, visualized every outcome — the terms, conditions, loopholes, and probabilities flow around and through each other in a beautiful pas de deux of legal exceptions. All that's left to me is to bask in my own brilliance." Renaldi confirmed that he intends to spend the balance of his career mocking the "obvious and pathetic" attempts to imitate his work by the legal team employed by Lay's "Do Us A Flavor" contest.

'Not Quite Perfect' McDonald's Opens In Illinois Outlet Mall
GURNEE, IL — Hungry shoppers at the Gurnee Mills outlet mall can now get a name-brand lunch at a bargain-basement price, thanks to the Monday opening of McDonald's first "Not Quite Perfect" outlet store, offering imperfect and irregular items from the fast-food giant's menu. "It's true that consistency is part of what makes McDonald's the leader in the fast-food industry, but so is good value," said Brian Landers, manager of the McDonald's outlet. "When customers see the low, low prices, they're more than willing to give our Six-Piece Quarter Pounders and Fish McGriddles a try. The food's a little different at this McDonald's, but it's really very close." Continued Landers: "Now, who's ready for factory seconds? !" Located next to a Levi's outlet store offering mis-stitched and off-season apparel, the McDonald's outlet will be the destination for all products that do not meet the strict requirements of the restaurant's 30,000 regular stores worldwide. "McDonald's prides itself on having exacting standards for its products," Landers said. "But throwing away all-carrot Salad Shakers, parallelogram-shaped hash browns, and McRibNuggets seemed so wasteful. With more of our customers struggling to make ends meet, we knew people would appreciate the opportunity to buy these slightly irregular products at irresistibly low prices." In addition to factory mistakes, the outlet will offer items that were tested in limited markets but never received a wide release. "We had a warehouse full of meat patties made in the shape of our golden-arch logo," Landers said. "A young, quickly fired executive thought it would be a good idea to make an 'M'-shaped burger, but it was expensive to produce, and depending where you took a bite, you had a very good chance of getting no beef. Plus, who's going to open up a burger just to look at the oddly shaped meat patty? Now, we're thawing them out and serving them up for only 30 cents apiece." Landers said that, while a number of customers have been wary, the prices are so astounding that "people always come back for more." "I've seen more than one person approach our firm-serve cones with skepticism," Landers said. "But at 20 cents each, we can hardly keep them in stock." Landers added, "Once they get over the mental block after eating a flash-frozen pyramid of vanilla ice cream, customers realize they just can't beat these prices." The outlet store, at 32,000 square feet, is the largest McDonald's in the world. In addition to serving irregular meal items, the outlet store houses irregular McDonald's decor. "These aren't the traditional McDonald's color schemes," Landers said, gesturing to chairs and tables in puce, mottled gray, and army green. "And while some customers make comments about our posters — a printer placed a black child's head on top of a white, elderly cashier's body — well, I think they look very nice once you get used to them." The outlet also features a shop that sells irregular McDonald's products like boxes of frozen foot-long fries and bags of unsweetened orange-drink syrup. "The bulk-foods section of the shop hasn't caught on as well as we'd hoped," Landers said. "We think that may be in part a question of functionality. Our 10-gallon buckets of McRib sauce, for example, are reasonably priced, but most people don't have condiment pumps at home. Of course, even those who do are sometimes disappointed to find relish inside." The outlet's PlayPlace features not-quite-perfect McDonaldland icons. "Parents worry about our ball pit, but those triangular balls meet Illinois minimum-safety requirements," Landers said. "What we've really gotten complaints about are the statues of the McDonaldland characters. Ronald McDonald's eyes were put in wrong so he's looking in two different directions, our Grimace is pink, and for some reason, the Hamburglar has no teeth." In spite of the few complaints, most outlet patrons say the bargain prices are well worth enduring the irregular food. "It's not like the meat's tainted," said Mack Vesper, a longtime McDonald's customer. "A Quarter Pounder on a half-size seedless bun tastes just as good. And, while the gray Shamrock Shake took some getting used to, once you realize that you're getting all the flavor at an eighth of the price, you adapt. Besides, who looks at the color of the shake once you start drinking it?" Some customers said the "Not Quite Perfect" McDonald's is not for them. "I'll never take my children there again," said Anita Sibakis, mother of three. "They opened up the Happy Meal and there were headless Mulan figurines in there. It scared the bejesus out my youngest."

Nation's Indigenous People Confirm They Don't Need Special Holiday, Just Large Swaths Of Land Returned Immediately
WASHINGTON — Affirming the importance of traditions like Columbus Day to other Americans, the nation's 573 federally recognized Indian nations released a joint statement Monday confirming they don't need a special holiday and would be perfectly fine with just having large swaths of land returned to them immediately. "Look, we get why Christopher Columbus is very important to some people, and we're more than willing to compromise so long as the U.S. government returns 1.5 billion acres of land to us as soon as they can," said Chief Harold Longtoe Ouimette, 63, an Abenaki elder who confirmed that although marching in a parade honoring Native peoples might be interesting, the group of indigenous tribes would vastly prefer if U.S. residents could just vacate Manhattan, the Black Hills, and thousands of other sites taken from them through broken treaties, coercion, and violence. "Obviously, honoring someone who caused a mass genocide is still troubling, but we're seriously open to letting that slide if we get back, say, the continent that you stole from us. That or $35 trillion. Your choice, honestly." At press time, the U.S. government had responded to the Native peoples' request with an offer of $5 in lump silver per person and a box of the finest cloth ever purveyed in Europe.

New Comcast Bundle Deal Includes 24/7 Live-In Technical Support
CHICAGO — In response to ongoing complaints of unexpected outages and subpar customer service response times, cable provider Comcast debuted a new bundle deal Thursday that includes 24/7 live-in technical support. "After analyzing customer feedback, we've realized that expecting our customers to set aside a six-hour block to be home every week is unrealistic, so we're sending some of our best people to stay on their couches," said Comcast head of market strategy Travis Porter, noting that higher-tier packages also include an optional air mattress or cot. "Whenever you need assistance with your cable, phone, or internet, your live-in technician will walk into your living room to help answer any questions. We should note that his or her English may not be great, so we do ask our customers to be patient. Additionally, we recommend customers not to stack a bunch of stuff on top of the technician in order to prevent overheating." Comcast confirmed that, in addition to the monthly rate, customers would also be responsible for paying a monthly activation fee to cover any nutritional needs.

Ronald McDonald Statue Bears Full Brunt Of Teenagers' Mockery
CLEVELAND — Remaining stoically silent throughout the barrage of vicious insults, unsavory accusations, and various other indignities directed at it, a statue of Ronald McDonald seated on a bench outside the fast-food chain's Clark Avenue location is said to have borne the full force of a group of teenagers' mockery Thursday. "Look at this stupid fucking thing," said 15-year-old Brandon Callahan, mercilessly disparaging the statue by pretending to give it a handjob as four of his friends looked on and laughed, but perturbing the figure's firm, unwavering resolve not a whit. "Who even put this ugly-ass thing out here? No one would ever want to sit down next to this dumb piece of shit. Fucking stupid corporate bullshit." Having remained steadfast and assured throughout the approximately six-minute onslaught of teenage derision, the fast-food mascot is said to have further displayed its controlled temperament and unyielding grace several hours later when it cradled a homeless man's head in its lap as he vomited, never once losing its expression of wholesome good cheer.

3-Year-Old Going To Hold In Fact That Cashier Is Fat Until He's At Checkout
Bettendorf, IA — Preparing to humiliate both his mother and the employee in one fell swoop, local 3-year-old Alex Delaney confirmed Tuesday that he was going to hold in the fact that the grocery store cashier is fat until he reaches the checkout. "Right now, I'm just thinking about the fact that the man is overweight, but once our cart reaches the register, I'm going to blurt out to everyone within earshot that he's fat," said the toddler, adding that he's still deciding between emphatically stating "You're fat" or quizzically asking "Mommy, why is that man fat?" "First, I'm going to lull him into a false sense of security by smiling at him and then giggling when he smiles back. Then when he trusts me — bam — I'm gonna let loose my discovery that he's the fattest man I've ever seen. It's pretty ingenious, really. This is just like the time I told grandma she's gonna die soon because she's so old." At press time, Delaney outlined plans to squeeze his penis for the entirety of his preschool's concert program.

Area Man To Hang Out At McDonald's For 20 Minutes Until Lunch Menu Goes Up
ERIE, PA — Upon being informed by a McDonald's cashier that the lunch menu would not be available until 11 a.m., restaurant patron Don Turnbee elected to wait 20 minutes inside the fast food establishment Saturday until the items he ordered would be served. "There aren't any other stores or anything that I like around here, so I figured I would just wait," said Turnbee, who typically frequents the McDonald's in the Buffalo Road shopping plaza, but chose to stop at the Pleasant Valley location because of its proximity to his wife's hair salon. "The girl at the counter said I could still get breakfast if I wanted, but 10:40's too late for breakfast." Added Turnbee, "I want lunch." The 41-year-old explained that he had already eaten breakfast earlier that morning, when he and his wife, Shelly, went to a nearby Bob Evans. Turnbee said he was not aware of the lunch-serving policy at this particular McDonald's. "They said they start [serving lunch] at 11 on weekends and 10:30 on weekdays," Turnbee told reporters. "The one on Buffalo Road does it earlier, so I guess it's different at different McDonald's. It should probably be the same, but it's different." According to restaurant employees, when Turnbee entered the establishment, he proceeded to order a No. 3 value meal with no pickles and a large Sprite. After they told him that lunch was not available until 11 a.m., Turnbee reportedly stood in silence for a few seconds, backed away from the cash register, and made his way to the seating area. "Before I ordered, I saw that the breakfast menu was up," Turnbee noted. "But sometimes they forget to switch the menu if you get there right when breakfast ends. Also, if it's close, they'll usually serve you lunch anyways. I guess they don't do that here." After dispensing several napkins and filling two ketchup containers, Turnbee selected a booth with a view of the menu board. He then sat for approximately one minute before glancing at his wristwatch and returning to the condiment counter to fill another ketchup container. By 10:48 a.m., Turnbee had begun slowly walking around the restaurant's perimeter, perusing the various decorative paintings hanging on the walls. He also examined a plaque featuring a brief description of the restaurant and its founder, even though he had previously read the same inscription on an identical plaque at the Pleasant Valley McDonald's. At one point, Turnbee entered the men's room. He later acknowledged that this trip was mainly to fill time. "It's getting pretty close to 11," Turnbee said. As he waited, Turnbee expressed his commitment to ordering lunch, stating that he would not, under any circumstance, order breakfast. "Their Egg McMuffins are pretty good, and the pancakes are all right, but I'm in the mood for a burger," said Turnbee, who when spotted moments later eating a hash brown explained that he needed something to tide him over, and that "hash browns are basically French fries." With five minutes to go before lunch, Turnbee began standing in line, allowing customers to proceed ahead of him if they confirmed they were ordering breakfast. He repeatedly peered out at patrons in the drive-thru, apparently to make certain they were not being served lunch. "There shouldn't be any difference between the drive-thru and when you go inside," he said. According to Turnbee, he has been in this position many times before, though mostly at Wendy's — a fast food establishment he said isn't very good at making clear when they serve breakfast. "I just hope that when the lunch menu goes up they're ready to serve everything," Turnbee said. "They should have the fries and the nuggets already cooked because people are definitely going to order them when they order lunch. You can usually order pop with breakfast, so that shouldn't be an issue." Continued Turnbee, "I wonder if the girl will remember my order or if I'll have to order again."

Nation's Sexual Degenerates Impatient For Gay Marriage Slippery Slope To Kick In
WASHINGTON — Assuming they'd be stripping away the moral fabric of society almost immediately after the Supreme Court's 2015 decision to legalize same-sex marriage, the nation's degenerates reported Monday that they have grown impatient for the gay marriage slippery slope to kick in. "We were promised that when gay marriage was legalized, it'd only be a matter of time before sickos like me would be having sex with our pets — well, I've got a dog and a cat I still haven't fucked," said an exasperated Alan Beleski, 42, one of the deviants from across the country who told reporters they were tired of waiting for the inevitable collapse in decency that would normalize acts such as bestiality, incest, and necrophilia. "Goddammit, what's taking so long? When gay marriages were finally recognized in this country, I thought, 'Hell yeah! I can finally openly proclaim my love for my sex doll, and I can also legally marry five other dolls because polygamy's A-okay, too.' But all that seems like a million years ago." At press time, the nation's degenerates took small comfort in states like Massachusetts where, with parental and court approval, a child can be married off at any age.

McDonald's Considering Franchising Restaurants After 70 Years Of Being Family Owned And Operated
OAK BROOK, IL — More than 70 years after the opening of the first McDonald's, the world's largest fast food hamburger chain announced Thursday it may soon begin franchising its restaurants, which until now have always been wholly owned and operated by the McDonald family. Allowing outside franchisees to start up their own McDonald's restaurants would reportedly mark a sharp departure for the company, which since its founding has exclusively employed blood relatives and in-laws of the McDonald family, both at its corporate offices and at each of its 34,000 locations worldwide. "For nearly three quarters of a century, every time someone has walked into one of our restaurants, their order has been rung up by a McDonald," said company spokesman Doug McDonald, noting that he, along with each of his siblings and cousins, grew up in the family business and has remained with it ever since. "We can guarantee that every burger ever flipped at a McDonald's was flipped by a McDonald." He added, "While we're proud of what our family members do — personally serving 69 million customers in 118 countries every day — we believe a different business model may be worth considering as we attempt to take our restaurant to the next level." According to company records, McDonald's was founded in 1940 by brothers Maurice and Richard McDonald, who worked with their wives and children preparing and serving food at the chain's first 500 U.S. locations. As business boomed, they soon turned to an extended family of uncles, aunts, cousins, and grandparents to fill the thousands of jobs being created each year. Today, the massive food-service retailer employs 1.8 million family members around the globe, including 500,000 McDonalds in the United States, 90,000 McDonalds in China, and 10,000 McDonalds in the Middle East. As the fast food chain expands — the company added an estimated 62,000 brothers-in-law to its workforce in 2012 — numerous McDonalds have said that the current growth rate is unsustainable without permitting franchisees to open new locations and hire non-McDonalds as workers. "The world is changing, and frankly we're running out of family members who speak Mandarin," said Xaoili McDonald, a shift manager at a location in Beijing. "There just aren't enough McDonalds living in China to staff all our restaurants, and trying to get our relatives to move over here and learn the language is next to impossible. Especially when you consider we pay people a lot less in developing nations." "Just ask my cousin Juan McDonald in Guadalajara," she added. But many family members have said the idea of franchising McDonald's locations to outsiders is simply unthinkable. Jessica McDonald, a 63-year-old drive-thru attendant from Massachusetts, told reporters she wants to keep things the way they were when she was young and all McDonald children accompanied their parents — whether they were board members, marketing directors, fry cooks, or dishwashers — to work to learn the family business firsthand. A final decision is expected to be made next month at a meeting of the company's top executives, a group including CEO James McDonald, president Ken McDonald, executive vice president Ross T. McDonald, human resources chief Janet McDonald-Harris, president of Latin American operations Maria Isabel Arroyo y Ramírez de McDonald, and retiring chairman Milt McDonald. "Whatever the outcome, McDonald's always has and always will be a family-oriented business," James McDonald wrote in his annual letter to the 483,970 shareholding members of the McDonald family. "Though we're not used to seeing a person we're not related to behind the counter, rest assured that whoever is there will always greet us in a uniform bearing those same golden arches our grandparents wore." "That's the McDonald's way," he continued. "And I should add that if the recent runaway success of the Chili family is any indication, franchising could really be a huge thing for us."

Nation's Long-Haired Old Men In Flowy Linen Shirts Announce You Are Loved
EUGENE, OR — A wide smile lighting up their faces as the crow's feet crinkled around their eyes, the nation's long-haired old men in flowy linen shirts issued a prepared statement Tuesday in which they confirmed that you are loved. "You are a wondrous creature overflowing with vibrancy and life, and you, my child, are cherished," said Huckleberry Spangler, 67, who spoke on behalf of the long-haired old men in a gravelly but warm voice, his arms outstretched as a wind of unknown origin caused his wispy untucked button-down and tangled hair to flutter calmingly. "Be still, for the love that fills all the universe finds a home in your heart. You are imbued with a light that shines brighter than any star in the heavens. Come forth and be embraced." At press time, sources reported that Spangler and several other linen-shirt-wearing old men had been forcibly removed from a local coffee shop while screaming, "No, sir, you are causing a scene! I will burn this place to the fucking ground!"

Maid Of Honor Specifically Selected For Ability To Take Emotional Beating
CHARLOTTE, NC — Calling the woman perfectly suited to bear the brunt of her pre-wedding psychosis, bride-to-be Emily Cervantes said on Thursday that she specifically picked her maid of honor Jessica Cross for her ability to take an emotional beating. "Jessica isn't even my very best friend, but she is by far the most able to endure my ever-changing whims, exasperatingly unclear directives, and, of course, tantrum after tantrum," said Cervantes, adding that no one else in her inner circle had the mental fortitude to withstand that level of trauma and still be able to plan the perfect bachelorette weekend. "It's going to get pretty dicey, and only someone like Jessica could wade through that kind of psychological shitstorm and not fall apart like a house of cards." Cervantes added that Cross was also ideal because the experience wouldn't leave her all that damaged if she had to go through this again in five years.

David Koch Pumps Billions Of Dollars Into Campaign To Secure Antonin Scalia A Seat In The Holy Trinity
THE HEAVENS — Noting that the deceased billionaire wasted no time after entering into Heaven's gates, angelic sources confirmed Friday that David Koch immediately launched a far-reaching, fully funded campaign to secure Antonin Scalia a seat in the Holy Trinity. "It's been far too long since a true conservative like Antonin Scalia ascended to the highest ranks of Heaven and held the title of Divine Person," said Koch, who, after arriving in the afterlife, reportedly began lobbying prominent Holy Angels and poured cash into conservative Heaven-wide advertising initiatives in order to secure a spot for the former Supreme Court justice to replace the Holy Spirit. "Over the years, Antonin has proved himself to have a strict originalist approach to scripture and God's commandments, and he is the only logical choice to get Heaven back on track. This is the first step of many to ensure that one day, the Holy Trinity has a conservative majority." At press time, sources had reported that David Koch had joined a coalition of prominent conservative Saints to begin grooming Neil Gorsuch for a position as a hypostasis when he dies.

Couple Just Wants Small Ceremony In Public Park With Close Friends And Shirtless Stranger Hanging Around Tree
SANDY SPRINGS, GA — Speaking to reporters ahead of their planned June wedding, engaged couple Sarah Hargrove and Brian Neely confirmed Monday that all they wanted was a small ceremony at their local park surrounded by close friends and a shirtless stranger hanging around a tree. "When we envision our special day, we're picturing a modest ceremony, maybe 50 people max, with our friend presiding and some creepy dude in the background grinning every so often as he sips out of a brown paper bag," said Hargrove, noting that she wanted a photographer who worked mostly in black-and-white and for the best shots to accidentally capture the guy either urinating in a bush or scratching the back of his cargo shorts. "We've been to a lot of big, fancy weddings, but that's not really our style — we just want an intimate gathering in a picturesque outdoor setting made extremely uncomfortable by some random weirdo's constant presence." Hargrove added that it was also important for them to have a picnic-style caterer whom the shirtless guy would harass for leftovers.

Paranoid Chinese Government Erases All Evidence Of Country's Existence From Internet
BEIJING — In an effort to completely stamp out any possibility of political unrest, officials within the Chinese government have scrubbed from the internet all evidence that might suggest their nation exists, according to a highly classified internal report obtained by reporters Wednesday. "To ensure the safety of our citizens, we have removed all written and visual representations of China, its history, and its people from the web forever," the report read in part, suggesting the government would look "terrible" if any information about the country were to reach the Chinese public, and thus the best course of action would be to permanently delete all mentions of the 4,000-year-old civilization. "Going forward, all internet searches for China will simply redirect to Korea, and our online encyclopedia articles will be revised to indicate that when Marco Polo reached the eastern edge of Central Asia, there was nothing else to see so he turned around and went home. In addition, Google Maps has agreed to replace our territory with a 9.6-square-kilometer bay that extends westward from the Pacific Ocean to the coast of Tajikistan." Asked for comment during a White House press briefing, President Trump praised China's Xi Jinping as a strong leader and suggested American news outlets could learn a lot from the Asian nation's state-run media.

70-Year-Old Man Worried He Running Out Of Time To Have Kids
TOPEKA, KS — After spending decades focused solely on his career and then retirement, local 70-year-old man Dennis Lambert was reportedly worried Tuesday that he was running out of time to have kids. "My biological clock is ticking, and I'm concerned there won't be many more opportunities to start a family," said Lambert, explaining that when you're "getting up there" in age, there are certain realities you have to start thinking about, namely that you may only have 10 or 20 viable years left to father a child, unless you want to be that 95-year-old dad playing with his kid at the park, being watched in silent judgment by onlookers. "I'm worried that I'm going to wake up one day and realize the chance to have children has passed me by because I'm dead. It just sucks that as a man, you only have this small, 80-year window in which you are able to procreate and that you are forced to choose between enjoying your retirement or having children." At press time, Lambert was considering freezing his sperm.

Nancy Pelosi Slams Edited Footage With Claim That When She's Drunk You'll Fucking Know It
WASHINGTON — Denying that there was any factual basis to the doctored footage shared by President Trump that suggested she was intoxicated, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blasted the viral video clip Friday by claiming that you'll fucking know it when she's drunk. "Yet again, we have the President spreading baseless accusations on his Twitter feed, this time implying I've been drunk on the job, when in reality there's not going to be any goddamn ambiguity whatsoever when I decide to get loaded," said Pelosi, telling reporters that she couldn't have been under the influence in the video because it did not feature her clutching the lectern for dear life while flipping off her colleagues and calling them "a gaggle of cocksuckers." "This video is a distraction from the malfeasance and cover-ups that this administration is actively engaged in, so let me put this matter to rest once and for all: When I get plastered, I'm a mean-ass drunk, so until you see me actively pissing on the House floor or pressing a broken beer bottle up to [Minority Leader] Kevin McCarthy's dumb face, you dipshits can rest easy knowing I've been sober as a goddamn judge." Pelosi reportedly went on to do a keg stand on the Capitol lawn to demonstrate exactly what "you fucking geniuses" should be on the lookout for.

Health Department Gives Tyson Plant 'D' Grade After Discovering Raw Chicken Contaminating Nearly Every Surface
SEDALIA, MO — Condemning the processed poultry giant's blatant disregard for well-established food safety practices, inspectors from the office of the Pettis County Health Board rated Tyson's Sedalia Center processing plant this week at a borderline 'D' upon discovering vast amounts of raw chicken contaminating nearly every working surface. "I can't imagine what led these poultry processors to think that a factory full of recently slaughtered chickens constituted a safe food-service environment," said health inspector Casey Franklin, noting that the plant's annual inspection revealed chicken carcasses on moving conveyor belts, gobbets of chicken flesh tumbling down chutes, and chicken limbs being sealed inside supposedly food-safe packaging. "In no case was any of this chicken properly cooked. It's shocking to think Tyson was going to ship that out to supermarkets across the country." Franklin added that if her team found more raw chicken upon their follow-up inspection next week, Tyson would have to be shut down.

Parents Worried Children Old Enough To Remember Family Vacation
YOUNGSTOWN, OH — Fearing that their kids' impressions of the experience could quite possibly remain with them for the rest of their lives, parents Joel and Bethany Weyandt told reporters Tuesday they are worried their children are old enough to remember the details of their recent family vacation. The husband and wife said their son, Michael, 6, and daughter, Nora, 5, have both reached an age at which they are capable of forming and retaining distinct memories, stoking the couple's concerns that the kids will be able to recall numerous details of their trip to Hershey, PA, from the oppressive heat, to the numerous barbs the parents uttered at one another, to the hours spent waiting in various lines. "It's sad to think that the kids are probably going to remember everything we went through on this trip — the tiny little hotel room, Michael's ear infection, all of it," said Bethany, noting in particular a heated exchange between her and her husband that occurred after he missed an exit on Interstate 80, as well as the 30 minutes of tense silence in the car that followed the argument, both of which she believed might now be part of her children's lifelong store of memories. "If Nora and Michael were still toddlers, we probably would have been in the clear. But they're too old now, so there's really no hope that the closed pool and the broken A/C at the hotel aren't going to leave a lasting impression on them." "There are too many moments that I just know are going to stick with them, like how bored they were on the Gettysburg battlefield tour — they hated every second of that." "Unfortunately, it's likely all going to be stuff they never forget," she added. "Even that lunch we had at Cracker Barrel when everyone was overtired." The series of regrettably memorable vacation episodes reportedly began with a reservation error at the Comfort Inn, forcing the family to spend much of the first afternoon of their vacation waiting in the facility's lobby while the problem was resolved, which subsequently limited them to just a brief half hour visit to Hershey's Chocolate World before they were forced to leave at closing. Moreover, the couple noted that there was little chance their children would forget that their father spent most every morning taking business calls, during which he would require the whole family to stay quiet. Additionally, the fact that the family had nothing to do but watch Night At The Museum on their iPad in their room for three straight afternoons due to a series of heavy thunderstorms would, according to the Weyandts, likely remain among their children's strongest associations with the vacation. "There are too many moments that I just know are going to stick with them, like how bored they were on the Gettysburg battlefield tour — they hated every second of that," Joel told reporters, noting that even when he asked Nora if she wanted to get a popsicle after enduring the daylong excursion, his daughter simply replied that she wanted to go back to the hotel, a "probable sign" that the memory had been formed and was there to stay. "Even if they look back on this trip and the only thing they remember is the sunburn they got during our visit to the zoo, that's going to be bad enough." "I want to believe that this is going to end up like our trip a couple of years ago when we all caught a stomach bug when we visited St. Louis — there's no way they remember any of that," he continued. "But I don't think we're going to be so lucky this time around." While the Weyandts expressed confidence that their children would be able to look back on certain moments with fondness, such as the round of mini-golf they played at a local family fun center, the pair confirmed that such positive memories would almost certainly be overshadowed by the chaos that resulted when Michael got separated from the others at Hersheypark and spent 15 minutes crying in the amusement park's visitor center until security reunited him with his panicked family members. The parents added that this episode, along with a later emotional meltdown when Michael was scared by the height of the Ferris Wheel, would almost certainly be the first things their son recalled when thinking about the vacation in the future. The couple further acknowledged their extreme fear that these events would perhaps be among the first thoughts their son and daughter would call to mind when thinking back upon their childhoods in general. "You always hope that something like this doesn't register, but the fact of the matter is that they're both going to remember every detail of when Nora got carsick on the drive home and we had to pull over and clean her up with a handful of napkins from the glove compartment," Bethany said. "And sadly, that's something we're just going to have to accept." "At least when we drive to Tampa to visit Grandma this Christmas, they'll be used to this kind of thing," she added.

McDonald's Unveils New Senior Citizen PlayPlace
OAK BROOK, IL — In an effort to accommodate an aging customer base and make the McDonald's experience "super fun for seniors 65 to 95," the fast-food chain unveiled its new Senior Citizen PlayPlaces Wednesday. "The ball pit has a special winch to lower seniors into and out of it," said day-shift manager Will Earle, adding that the tunnel-maze has multiple exits in case seniors become disoriented or scared. "We have a slide wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs, and on Saturdays, Ronald himself stops by to make balloon animals and just talk to the old folks. They like talking to Ronald." McDonald's confirmed plans to open even more senior PlayPlaces by 2013, saying they provide a space in which children can enjoy a meal and still keep an eye on their elderly parents or grandparents.

Christmas-Obsessed Woman Worships Christ Year-Round
MISSOULA, MT — Observing that she seems to "go a bit overboard" with her enthusiasm for the season, sources confirmed Friday that local woman Linda Gillespie is so obsessed with Christmas that she worships Jesus Christ throughout the entire year. "Even in summer, Linda will be brimming with the holiday spirit and praising the Lord Jesus as her savior," said neighbor Daniel Bonn, explaining that Gillespie goes so far as to attend a Christ-themed service every Sunday of the year as if it were Christmas morning. "I like Christmas as much as the next guy, but considering it's not even Thanksgiving yet, don't you think it's a little odd that the inside of her home is decorated with a bunch of depictions of Christ? She's also apparently joined some kind of weird choir that sing songs about Jesus year-round." At press time, sources confirmed Gillespie had finally let go of the Christmas spirit after a severe crisis of faith caused her to stop believing in God altogether.

Time Flies When You're Feeding An Addiction To Internet Pornography Over Which You No Longer Have Any Control
I try to stay on top of things, but I can't tell you how surprised I was this week when I looked at a calendar for the first time in I don't know how long and I saw that we're almost all the way through August. August! Can you believe it? I mean, here I was thinking that summer had just started, and it turns out we're closing in on the end of the year! I guess it really is true what they say: Time flies when you spend every waking hour feeding an addiction to internet pornography over which you no longer have any semblance of control. Seriously, isn't it amazing how quickly the days go by when you've become a powerless slave who spends every moment gaping at hardcore erotica? It's like, you blink, Monday turns into Tuesday, Tuesday turns into Wednesday, and the next thing you know you've consumed hundreds of thousands of videos of women debasing themselves for your perverted gratification, a mindless and never-ending exercise in sexual depravity that no longer gives you any real pleasure and now serves as nothing more than an empty, joyless compulsion. It's pretty crazy. And the years can really sneak up on you, too. One day you're living a healthy, well-rounded life in which your casual interest in online smut hasn't yet destroyed your family and personal relationships, and then, in a flash, a decade has passed and there you are, devoting every ounce of energy to seeking out and staring at an uninterrupted image stream of barely 18-year-old girls masturbating on camera. And you just have to ask yourself, "Where did the time go?" It all just happens so fast. The seasons change, every month you get a credit card statement clogged with subscription fees for the increasingly graphic gang-bang footage you now desperately crave, and before you know it, your kids are all grown up, you've got more than a few gray hairs, and you've transformed yourself into little more than a frantic, pathological collector of gaping orifices and tanned flesh. I think we all know that feeling. Honestly, it can feel like life is passing you right on by! I mean, there's only so many hours in a day, and in between calling in sick to work until they fire you and huddling by your computer in a darkened room watching an endless parade of nameless women have anal sex in a van, there just isn't enough time to go around. You know how it can be: the days tick by, the weeks turn into months, and then you miss your daughter's birthday party yet again because you were in the middle of a horrific, 36-hour amateur facial binge with your pants at your ankles and the phone off the hook. It really makes you think. But then you go right on back to watching pornography. And then you jerk off, again and again and again, always hoping to coax just one more strained ejaculation from your chafed and embattled genitalia. And sooner or later you're convulsing in tears because you've somehow managed to exhaust Xtube.com's vast archives of BBW squirting clips in another delirious porn bender that you won't even remember later. And when you do manage to gain an all-too-brief moment of clarity, you sometimes can't even remember everything that's happened to you since you came across that first low-resolution thumbnail of a woman baring her breasts on Playboy Online. Sure, you can sort of picture the big stuff — your wedding, your pathetic attempts at rehabilitation that never lasted longer than the time it took to power up your semen-flecked laptop, your divorce — but everything else is just a blur of browser tabs and live feeds of Eastern European women urinating that feels like a snapshot from someone else's nightmarish life. Because, like it or not, you can't just put life on pause. The sun will rise, the sun will set, you'll bolt out of bed at 3 a.m. and mindlessly stumble to your computer in a feverish attempt to appease those twisted desires that even the most depraved corridors of the internet can no longer sate, and the fact of the matter is this: No matter how you might try to slow it down, time marches on at its own steady pace, and you are a monster. But, hey, that's just the way it goes! You live, you die, you want to watch porn. You want to watch it so bad, maybe just for a minute or two, then you'll get back to writing. Yeah, just a couple minutes, just to calm yourself down a little. You're breathing so fast. Just a few videos, maybe. Click on that one. Good, good, now click on that one. Yeah, good, okay. Now click on that one. No, no good, not good enough. Click on that one. Watch that one. It's not loading fast enough. Fuck! It's not fucking loading! Wait, no. Oh, God. Help me help help.

Trump Turns On Fox News And Tells Aides To Make Whatever They're Saying A Law
WASHINGTON — Demanding aides write down every single word from the morning's Fox & Friends broadcast, President Trump turned on Fox News Tuesday and directed his staff to take everything its anchors were saying and make it into a law, White House sources confirmed. "Whatever they're talking about right now, just draft it up and put it on my desk so I can sign it," said Trump as he reportedly rewound the TiVo in the Oval Office dining room and replayed a sound bite from Steve Doocy that is expected to become the law of the land by the end of the week. "There's a lot of really good material here — you've got the caravan, stuff about guns, ISIS — make sure you get it all down. You hear the places where they're chuckling? Put that in there, too. I want everything." At press time, sources said the president's aides were handing him a final draft of an executive order that appeared to be a verbatim 60-page transcription of Your World With Neil Cavuto, complete with the text of several ads for IHOP and Sandals Resorts.

Tucker Carlson Unsure Why He In Middle Of 20-Minute Rant Against Croutons
NEW YORK — Taking a moment to reflect on how "the world's most elitist bread" made its way into his current tirade, Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson paused midway through his show Thursday and expressed confusion about why he was currently 20 minutes into an irate rant against croutons. "These overblown, liberal salad toppings represent everything that is wrong with America today — huh, what am I even talking about?" said the host of Tucker Carlson Tonight, who, after spending the better part of his broadcast warning viewers against the evils of croutons, looked straight into the camera and admitted he had no memory of shifting gears and launching into a speech about how the toasted garnish is a blatant attack on Democratic society. "I know they are an affront to this country. And I know that garlic, Parmesan, and tomato-basil flavors are everything our founding fathers would have hated and fought valiantly against. But this segment was supposed to be about conservatives being persecuted in the workplace, so the connection must be in there somewhere." At press time, Carlson had reportedly given up attempting to retrace his steps and had instead doubled down and called for a nationwide boycott of every single crouton brand sold in American supermarkets.

New Evidence Reveals Library Of Alexandria Kicked Out Dozens Of Creepy Old Romans For Looking At Pornographic Images On Abacus
OXFORD — Shedding new light on the history of one of antiquity's most renowned archives, researchers at Oxford University announced Thursday the discovery of new evidence suggesting that the Library of Alexandria was forced to kick out dozens of creepy old Romans for viewing pornographic images on abacuses. "Oxford university archives contain several hitherto untranslated scrolls dating from the third century B.C., the library's most prosperous period, which make several mentions of tawdry, unwashed Romans pleasuring themselves at the library's abacus stations while parents tried to herd their children past," said historian Allen Boisvert, noting that as the library declined due to the neglect and lack of funds that it suffered under the Roman Principate, there were likely fewer and fewer staff members who could tell these degenerates to leave. "This evidence is confirmed by the extant diary entries of the scholar Zenodotus of Ephesus that describe confronting a wizened man, 'his toga anointed with night-soil and his beard bedewed with sour wine,' who continued using the abacus to display erect phalluses and to spell out the word ubera, or 'boobs' in Latin, despite the protestations of the librarian and repeated threats of a lifetime ban." Boisvert added that research further indicated that the burning of the Library of Alexandria in 272 A.D. displaced these elderly degenerates into the streets of Alexandria, where many wandered around the local coliseum making lewd gestures at women.

Fox News Intern Fetching Coffee Tells Herself This Will All Pay Off When She Trump's Secretary Of State One Day
NEW YORK — In an effort to cope with the stressful task of fetching coffee for demanding staffers, Fox News intern Hattie Butler reportedly told herself Friday that this would all pay off when she was named President Trump's secretary of state one day. "It's really tough to keep everyone's drink orders straight, but the quick thinking and multi-tasking abilities that I've demonstrated during this internship will be invaluable to president Trump when I'm serving as his secretary of state," said the 23-year-old college graduate who reassured herself that if she paid her dues by delivering the correct beverages, she would eventually earn the right to determine U.S. policies toward foreign powers and navigate complex diplomatic issues that might place the world at the brink of war. "I'm a real go-getter, and my can-do attitude would make me a great asset to the president. Not just anyone can keep a cool head while trying to remember who takes their coffee half-caff and who gets three pumps of vanilla syrup with just a splash of soy milk, but if I keep at it, I can really see this unpaid internship helping me get my foot in the door at the U.S. State Department. Maybe one day I'll help foster peace between the United States and Puerto Rico. It's just a matter of time before I have an intern bringing me coffee!" At press time, Butler was drafting up a resume on her iPhone to send to the White House.

New Porno Worth Checking Out Even For People Who Aren't Familiar With 5 Guys Jerking Off On Single Pair Of Tits
LOS ANGELES — Adult film fans have praised the newly released Batter Splatter 9, calling the 43-minute pornographic DVD accessible even to people who aren't previously acquainted with five guys jerking off on a single set of tits. "There's something in this movie for everyone, whether you already know something about five men of varying ethnicity repeatedly ejaculating upon the breasts of a young woman, or whether you're a first-time viewer," pornography enthusiast Rick Baineman said Thursday, stressing that the film did not contain any overly esoteric references or jargon-filled dialogue familiar only to longtime devotees. "The first two minutes might be a little confusing to the uninitiated, but once the guys start unzipping their jeans and forming a semicircle, you get brought up to speed pretty quickly. " Baineman added that while the film can be enjoyed on multiple levels, those already familiar with pulling out at the last second and climaxing on a woman's face might get more out of it.

Tucker Carlson Angrily Explains Difference Between Good Baby And Bad Baby
NEW YORK — Shouting directly at the camera while a graphic of two infants appeared on the screen behind him, Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson used the opening segment of his show Tuesday to angrily explain the difference between a good baby and a bad baby. "Idiot liberals will tell you that there's only one type of baby, but that's a lie — the good babies we have in America are not the same as the nasty, dangerous, bad little babies trying to sneak in through our borders," said the host of Tucker Carlson Tonight, urging viewers not to be fooled by photos of wicked immigrant babies who are simply pretending to be good to trick benevolent Americans into feeling sympathy for them, even though they are, in fact, bad. "This baby is a good baby because it doesn't want to hurt you. And this baby is a bad baby because, even though it doesn't have basic motor skills, it wants more than anything to hurt you and your family. But make no mistake, once these evil, morally bankrupt babies can lift their heads, it's all over for this country and our precious, good babies." Carlson went on to say that after the commercial break, he would be sitting down for an in-depth screaming match with his guest, an 8-month-old Venezuelan girl.

Report: Distracted Driving Results In More Than 5,000 Unfinished Texts Each Year
WASHINGTON — Describing the findings as "deeply troubling," the U.S. Department of Transportation released a report Tuesday revealing that the growing epidemic of distracted driving is responsible for more than 5,000 unfinished text messages a year. "Far too often, drivers concentrating on their phones instead of the road lose control of their vehicles and get into accidents, tragically cutting short the messages they were attempting to type," Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said of the report, which reviewed six years' worth of gruesome automobile crashes that ended the texts of the drivers involved. "Of all these messages that were lost, many were very brief and still had many more words to go. Now, we will never know what they might have said, or where they might have been sent. Their abrupt, mid-sentence endings were both sad and unnecessary." The report strongly urged citizens to avoid texting while driving, noting that distracted drivers aren't just putting their own texts at risk, but also those of their passengers and other drivers.

Nostalgic Scientists Rediscover Polio Vaccine
NEW YORK — A half century after Jonas Salk first devised a vaccine for polio, nostalgic researchers at NYU Medical Center rediscovered the "classic" inoculation late Tuesday night, recreating the immunization treatment from a monkey kidney tissue culture determined to be highly evocative of the original. "It was a simpler time back then," said project leader Dr. Timothy Riordan, who lamented his generation having lost touch with many traditions from the early days of virology. "They just don't make vaccines like this anymore. There was a real craft to it back then." At press time, the scientists had shifted their efforts toward finding a way to contain the new deadly and virulent strain of polio they had inadvertently created.

Apple Releases Brief, Fleeting Moment Of Excitement
CUPERTINO, CA — Ending weeks of anticipation and intense speculation, tech giant Apple unveiled a short and fleeting moment of excitement to the general public Tuesday during a media event at its corporate headquarters. "With this groundbreaking new release, Apple has completely revolutionized the way we experience an ephemeral sense of wonder lasting no longer than several moments," said Wired writer Gary Turnham, who added that the company has once again proved why it's the global leader in developing exhilarating sensations that only temporarily mask one's underlying feelings before dissolving away. "Even before today's announcement, people across the country were lining up to be among the first to get their hands on this new short-lived and non-renewable flash of satisfaction. And they won't be disappointed; this already vanishing glimmer of pleasure is exactly what we've come to expect from Apple." According to Turnham, rumors are already swirling that Apple engineers are working on a slimmer, briefer moment of excitement projected for release next fall.

Sexy Lyrics, Sexual Teens

I Have A Thing For Asia
Man, if I had to name one continent that really just does it for me, there's no question which one I'd pick: Asia. It just drives me wild. I know that a lot of my friends still don't get it, and I've gotten my share of glares from ex-girlfriends, but you know what? It's their loss. They're more than welcome to their Europes and North Americas. That just leaves more Asia for me. It began in high school, when I was first exposed to different landforms. It was then that I realized my deep attraction to the remote, demure, but utterly entrancing continent of Asia. In college, I double-majored in geography and earth science, but only so I could get closer to Asia. Senior year, I had the privilege to study in Tokyo, and let me tell you — once you get a taste of the Asian continent, you can never go back. And I keep coming back for more, whether it's South Korea, Hong Kong, or Thailand. Especially Thailand. Sure, I've felt like an outsider more than once in my life. It seemed all my geography friends would talk about was the sultry and sometimes fiery terrain of Italy, or the ample coastlines of Brazil, or the pale blond wheat fields of Germany, or the cool, stark beauty of Norway's fjords. But I always found these to be rather vulgar and overdone, like they were thrusting themselves at me. You hear a lot about the openness of Eastern Europe, but I've never seen a map of it without the pockmarked, aging topography. No thanks. And North America? Forget it. My stomach turns just thinking about those shallow lakes and massive mountains. Exotic and otherworldly, Asia always has me in its grip. Parts of it seem fragile and delicate, yet it's overwhelmingly powerful, lithe, and tender. The fine landscapes, deep, mysterious, yellow-tinted rivers you're never quite sure where they will lead, quiet, calm plateaus, smooth valleys that fold epicanthally into one another, pert peaks — it's all there. I could have explored every inch of that continent and there would always be another petite, fresh-looking valley around the corner. It was just too much. Even the youthful charms of Thailand are too tempting to pass up — wrong, yet so very right at the same time. See, with Asia, you get a tantalizing mystery. Just when you think you've penetrated it, up out of nowhere comes a thick bamboo rain forest, or the Himalayas. When I look at Japan, I can't help but think, "Now that's a land mass. " It's spare and tightly formed, but with just the right amount of curves. It's simply sublime. Some people complain that with all the earthquake activity, Asia's too demanding, unpredictable, even shrewish at times. But I think that's nothing more than a stereotype at worst, a lovable quirk at best. After years of travels, I'm now back home in my apartment near Chinatown, but already I'm longing for more, and I suspect it shows. My friends have called me on my tendency to e-mail them pictures of the light-brown soil of Laos and the small but perfectly formed hills in the southern edge of China, and my blog's hosting service forced me, after some complaints, to take down my latest post about reintroducing the pink dolphin into the Three Gorges region. It's amazing how people take such personal offense with my passion. But, I cannot change. I like what I like. My friend Mark, a fellow I met in Hanoi who's also into Asia, claims that he once navigated two Asian countries in the same night, but I'm not sure I believe him. I think he knew that was my ultimate fantasy and was just trying to get me riled up. He knows that I was too nervous in the countries I was visiting. But beyond that, I have too much respect for them to explore them through and through on the first trip, you know? Nathanial Morgenstern

U.S. Trendsetters Go On Strike
NEW YORK — More than 11,000 trendsetters, tastemakers, movers, and shakers gathered in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood Monday to declare a strike against the broad segment of the American population that they say routinely copies their fashions, musical tastes, and sensibilities. Should the strike persist, experts said, it could bring the pop-cultural life of the nation to a standstill. "We want recognition for what you're wearing, saying, or doing," said Jaycee Kingsley, a 22-year-old animator and silkscreen artist from San Francisco who, nearly four years ago, started the oversized-dark-sunglasses trend, popularized by celebrities Mary-Kate Olsen and Nicole Richie. "Without us, America would be wearing Nehru jackets and saying 'right on' all the time. If we don't get our due, we will have little choice but to stop sparking new fads. Until the public accepts their demands, the strikers vow to wear only gray or blue utilitarian sweatpants or flannel, and refuse to listen to any synthesized music, wear makeup, shop at thrift stores, bake cupcakes, "make the scene," or discuss any potential trends or up-and-coming drugs. The strikers are calling for public acknowledgment of their contributions as well as a retroactive 10-cent royalty on every trendy item sold since October 1995. This fee, to be paid by consumers for each trend they adopt, would be applied to cultural phenomena as diverse as Japanese toy miniatures and so-called "Strokes" haircuts, the latter actually pioneered by Dayton, OH sandwich-shop employee and Whip-It junkie Jarvis McClung in 1997. News of the strike quickly spread through word of mouth, blogs, and Facebook.com, and "sympathy strikes" are already being organized by fashion-forward hipsters in France and Japan. If a collective-bargaining agreement cannot be reached, trendsetters will likely be replaced with scabs. Indeed, some second-rate trends have already begun sprouting up, as aspiring tastemakers — often the same people maligned by the ultrahip as "poseurs" — cross picket lines and attempt to fill the void left by the strike. Many of their ideas, such as adopting chinchillas as pets, are largely recycled, and, while their original innovations, such as wearing top hats and paper shoes, walking with crutches, and referring to friends as "Frankenstein," may seem forced, they could potentially be the only trends available for some time. With an estimated one in four Americans relying on guidance from trendsetting gurus, sales are down at malls and Salvation Army stores across the country. "This strike is really bad for business," said Seattle, WA electronics store owner Eddie Barghasian. "Who's going to buy an even smaller cell phone when there's no nightlife or nothing to photograph? Perplexed Americans, stripped of their taste barometers, are having to make do with older trends. "None of my friends know what to do anymore," said 17-year-old Kari Hartley, a Fayetteville, AR high-school student who relies on lower-tier stores like Hot Topic for fashion cues. Already feeling the strike's pinch, Hartley has been wearing the same Von Dutch hat, silk-screened hooded sweatshirt, and "Don't Mess With Texas" beltbuckle — the most recent trends available to her before the strike. While acknowledging that the look is "stale," Hartley said she has little choice. "If this thing doesn't end soon, I might not be able to wear anything. Strikers have been in talks since Monday with various magazine editors, marketing directors, and product developers who rely heavily on their trailblazing tastes. "I can't tell you what they're talking about in there," said Lucky magazine editor Kim France. "But I can tell you that these are some very cutting-edge negotiations. "Most Americans may not know how to generate a trend, but they know a good one when they see one, and will support us in these negotiations," said adult-size bunny-hat inventor Gabe Deckland, who said qualified trendsetters have the upper hand. "Scabs will just shank it anyway. Yet DailyCandy.com contributor Cass Myerson said the strike may inadvertently generate a new trend, pointing to reports that some followers have already begun their own hip work stoppages. "The romance of the worker's struggle, the charisma of heroes like Cesar Chavez — I love it! " Myerson said. "I think we're going to be seeing a lot of drab shirts, coarse wool coats, and fierce Maoist pigtails on the runway this fall. In everything — from the way we talk and the way we dress, to the way we don't work — striking is going to be huge this year.

I Was In A Movie Called 'Waterworld' And Global Warming Is Causing Rising Sea Levels, So Is There Anything To That? Is That Worth Writing An Op-Ed About? No? I Dunno, Anyways…
Hi, I'm Kevin Costner. In 1995, I was in a pretty big-budget movie called Waterworld, and a major plot point of Waterworld was that the polar ice caps had completely melted, the sea levels rose, and the world was covered in water. I guess I'm bringing this up because a big thing currently happening on Earth is that Waterworld is kind of happening in real life. So what I'm wondering is this: Do you guys think there's anything to that? That maybe there's a pointed newspaper op-ed in there somewhere? Like, I dunno, a 400- to 600-word think piece about how prescient Waterworld was? Maybe something that weaves together the themes of Waterworld and relates them to our current global predicament? Whaddaya think? Yes? No? Total waste of time? Could be something there though, right? Or maybe not. Perhaps it's kind of a thin idea and not really worth it. Can't really tell. Anyways... It's just that, and not to harp on it, but about a month ago I was at the premiere of my new movie The Art Of Racing In The Rain (I play the voice of the dog, Enzo), and I got to thinking: The planet is warming, polar ice caps are melting, that's what Waterworld was about, I'm Kevin Costner, I was in "Waterworld." Isn't there just, like, a coherent piece about that shouting to be written? Something titled, like, I dunno, "Waterworld Could Happen," or "Waterworld Is Already Happening," or, just thinking out loud here, "I Don't Want To Live In Waterworld Twice, By Kevin Costner." Could totally be good, right? Now, I'd probably leave out all the stuff about the marauding band of pirates called the Smokers, and that whole sequence where my character gets pissed off at the kid for using his crayons and then throws her off the boat, and, in fact, I'd probably just keep the focus on the world being covered in lots of water. But, yeah…there's a kernel of something there… Or maybe it sucks. Who knows? I really go back and forth on this thing. Could be a brilliant observation — that what we thought was a silly premise 25 years ago could actually be our future — or maybe it's kind of on the nose and expected. I dunno…I guess if I'm being honest with myself, it's just kind of a loose collection of ideas in my head right now, and that's not really anything. Guess I really wouldn't know until I rolled up my sleeves, got under the hood, and wrote the damn thing. Like, here's something I've kicked around: I could do something high concept-y where the op-ed is from my character in Waterworld, and the opening sentence is something like: "This is the Mariner. I am here to trade the rare commodity of dirt for supplies, but first, let's talk our warming planet." Or I could just be very sincere and say, "Hey, I'm Kevin Cosnter, I won an Academy Award for directing Dances With Wolves, and I was in Waterworld. A real problem faces this planet today, and here's what I gleaned from Waterworld that may help." I guess I'd edit out that Dances With Wolves part. Doesn't really fit the premise of the piece. That's just my ego talking. Actors ya know? C'mon, Kevin, you're better than that. I remember when I first started circling this idea. It was about three years ago, and I was on the set of Molly's Game, and I asked Jessica Chastain if she thought there was something there and she was like, "Oh, yeah, I could see that. Maybe...depends…" and I was like, "Yeah…see you on set." Jessica was always hard to read. Hey, you guys like Molly's Game? I thought it was pretty good. Not great, but it had some moments, right? I liked my part. Tin Cup's a fun movie, right? Holds up. Solid sports movie with a good love story. Anyways, Waterworld — I drink my own piss in it. Remember that? Now I'll grant you that maybe I'm way too close to this thing. It's no secret I was the star of Waterworld. There is a chance that I probably think about Waterworld way more than most people think about Waterworld. So maybe any op-ed about Waterworld would be kind of insidery and only really appeal to people who were in Waterworld, like Jeanne Tripplehorn, who played Enola's guardian and attempts to escape with her to Dryland on a hot air balloon using a map tattooed on Enola's back. I guess if you didn't know any of that stuff, the op-ed wouldn't be interesting to you at all. Or maybe you really wouldn't need to know the plot details of Waterworld and would just remember the overall premise and that would be enough and you'd be, like, "I don't need to know the movie. What I vaguely remember about Waterworld was that the world was covered in water. I'm on board." Dennis Hopper was in Waterworld, and he's dead now. Okay, before I close, I do think I should address the elephant in the room. Waterworld was a flop. A big old major studio failure. But, see, I think that kind of helps it, right? Waterworld occupies this weird space in the culture because it was kind of written off as a big joke when it first came out. So I was thinking, maybe that could be what the op-ed is about. Maybe there is something interesting there about how it was written off by everyone. Something about how Waterworld was viewed as dumb, but now, based on what's going on with the climate, maybe, in retrospect, Waterworld isn't so dumb after all. Was Waterworld actually the 1984 of its time? Now that's a pretty great title for the piece. Or not. .. Maybe it's lame. .. I dunno. .. Anyways, you can watch Waterworld right now on Hulu if you have a Starz add-on. By Kevin Costner

Honey, If You Ever Have Any Questions About Sex, You Can Always Consult The Hundreds Of Pages Of Fan Fiction In My Closet
Well, you're getting to that age. Your body is starting to change, and you may have begun to experience new kinds of feelings you've never felt before. I wish I could keep you little forever, but I can't! It's not always the easiest thing to talk about, but I want you to know that anytime you have a question about sex — no matter what it is — you can go into my closet and consult the hundreds of pages of fan fiction I've written. It's only natural to be curious about sex, sweetie, and my shelves full of unpublished erotica based on well-known fictional characters are always right there when you need answers. You may have heard things about sex from your friends or classmates, but I want to make sure you get the right information, okay? And one place you can find it is, for example, in my short story that covers in graphic detail everything that happens off screen in season two of Buffy The Vampire Slayer when Buffy loses her virginity to Angel, a 200-year-old vampire. I know all this may seem a bit bewildering right now, but sex can be a wonderful and beautiful thing, a lesson I hope you'll glean from the 20 years' worth of smut I've written set in the worlds of The Avengers, The Hunger Games, and The Hobbit. As your body changes, I'm sure you've noticed your thoughts are changing too. Maybe there are boys in your class you don't think of the same way you used to. This can be confusing and even a little scary, especially if you haven't read my three Gilmore Girls–Harry Potter crossover screenplays, in which Rory Gilmore falls for a brooding Ron Weasley, can't take her mind off the bulging shaft under his robe, and longs to feel the magic of his thick, throbbing wand. But these kinds of urges are perfectly normal, honey. Look, I can see you're starting to blush. Still, you may find it helpful to look through my portfolio of illustrated fanfic that shows how, as they go through puberty, Sailor Moon's breasts begin to ripen and both of Sonic the Hedgehog's penises grow in length and girth. Of course, you may not be attracted to boys, and that's fine — whatever you feel, there's nothing to be ashamed of. Among the manuscripts filling the half dozen or so bankers' boxes at the back of my closet, you'll find one about Star Trek Voyager's Seven of Nine finally learning what it means to be human one night as she explores every orifice of Captain Janeway's body with her tongue. As long as it's shared with someone we love and trust, a healthy sexual relationship can involve a woman and a man, a woman and a woman, a man and a man, or a woman and an anthropomorphic duck. I know you may think it's a little early to be talking about this stuff. After all, your period may not start for another couple years. But it's best to get an early start looking through those hundreds of thousands of words so you'll have the answers you need to questions such as "How do condoms work?" You'll learn all about that in my Doctor Who spec script about a temporal rift that allows Rose Tyler to fulfill her fantasy of having sex with all 13 incarnations of the doctor at the same time, enjoying the variety of his many different penises. I know you're squirming, and I'm sure you want to go outside and play with your friends. Believe me, I understand. When I was your age, my own mother handed me a crudely bound book with Huckleberry Hound and Betty Rubble on the cover, murmuring something about how those two spent an entire night engaging in every depraved sexual act you can imagine and then, as the sun rose, took turns pissing on each other's naked bodies. I thought I would die of embarrassment! Just remember that any question you could possibly have is answered in those reams and reams of paper stacked up behind your mom's clothes. If you ever think of something that's not, just give me a pen, paper, and 15 minutes behind a locked door so I can whip something up for you. By Gina Driggs

World Leaders Eagerly Await As G7 Organizers Announce Raffle Drawing For Nintendo Switch
BIARRITZ, FRANCE — As the three-day global conference drew to a close, the world leaders present at the G7 summit eagerly waited Monday as the event's organizers announced the raffle drawing for a Nintendo Switch. "Oh man, I've been wanting a Switch so bad, and Parliament won't give me any money to buy one, so I put almost all my raffle tickets in that bucket," said a hopeful Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who dismissed accusations that he had acquired additional raffle tickets from German chancellor Angela Merkel in exchange for an exclusive trade deal between their two countries as a way to increase his chances at landing the grand prize. "The Switch is really sweet because you can play it at home or in the car, or on the plane for my long trip back home to Canada. Plus, it comes with Breath Of The Wild, which I've wanted to play ever since it came out. I think I deserve it, too, since I didn't win the $50 Hard Rock Café gift card or the beach towels. Also, the Canadian prime minister hasn't won the best raffle prize since Stephen Harper got that sweet Nikon D90 SLR camera way back in 2008. So I hope I win. I swear, if that idiot [French president Emmanuel] Macron gets the Switch, I'm going to be so pissed. This is the prize everyone's been waiting three days for. They have to have really cool raffle prizes at all the G7s, otherwise no one would show up." At press time, a furious Trudeau had screamed, "This is bullshit!" and stomped out of the conference room after the G7 organizers announced that the winner of the Nintendo Switch raffle was U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson.

Area Man Considers Self Ally To Women Unless They Threaten His Status In Literally Any Way
PHILADELPHIA — Calling himself a "staunch supporter" of issues ranging from equal pay to reproductive rights, area man Brian MacKinnon told reporters Monday he considers himself an ally to women unless they threaten his personal status in any way whatsoever. "I would definitely describe myself as a feminist [insofar as that designation means that I don't have to change any of my behaviors or attitudes in the slightest]," said MacKinnon, adding that as long as they don't rise to an equal position, get promoted before he does, or even challenge him in a meeting, he regularly goes out of his way to help his female colleagues in the workplace. "We all have to do our part. When I see an injustice against a woman, I speak up about it [unless it might make me come across as weak in front of my male peers], and I will stand up for women's progress each and every day [provided that, in the end, I still retain a level of gender-based privilege for the remainder of my life]." MacKinnon went on to say that he could not be more disappointed, at least in the company of women, that we did not elect a female president.

Wealthy Socialite Falling For Unrefined But Beautiful Lower-Class Populace
DARIEN, CT — Admitting that his affection for their gauche and boorish ways had surprised even himself, prominent socialite J. Thomas Donelan III confirmed Wednesday that he was falling for the nation's unrefined but beautiful lower classes. Donelan, an industrialist and avid patron of the arts whose net worth is estimated at $8.6 billion, told reporters that while at first he was repulsed by lower-income Americans' fashion sense, eating habits, speech, and pedestrian interests, their simple charms had gradually turned his disdain into fondness, and then, finally, into something closer to love. "For a long time, I looked down on ordinary people, with their uncultivated tastes for malt beverages and stock car racing, but one day, something about them just caught my eye," Donelan said as he recalled an incident not long ago when his chauffeur took a wrong exit off the freeway, accidentally driving the 59-year-old heir through a working-class neighborhood he had never seen before, where he was reportedly taken aback by the humble beauty underneath residents' Quiznos uniforms and Juicy Couture sweatpants. "As I looked at them, I felt strangely drawn to them, despite their poorly groomed exteriors and lack of sophistication." "I can't say why — maybe it was the twinkle in their eyes as they watched fail videos on their phones, or just the way they stood there at their bus stops — but at that moment, I just knew I had to see them again," he added. Soon finding himself "quite taken" with the population of Americans making less than $10 per hour, Donelan reportedly became convinced that with some work, he could turn them into something presentable to society, perhaps even one day flying them out to meet and mingle with his fellow upper-class citizens at a gala fundraiser in the Hamptons or accompanying them to an exclusive soiree in the south of France. Brushing aside doubts from his friends and business associates, Donelan said he began by trying to make poorer Americans' appearances "a little more pleasing to the eye." On trips to bespoke tailors and high-end boutiques, he had their wardrobes of football jerseys, calf-length mesh shorts, Crocs, and stretch pants replaced with trunks full of designer garments and top-of-the-line accessories. According to sources, the multibillionaire coached the nation's bottom third of earners on their diction, and ultimately hoped to elevate their conversational skills to the point where they would no longer routinely use the phrase "cray cray" or quote lines from Anchorman 2 when meeting members of his social circle. "Getting 70 million people to stop wiping their hands on their pants was an enormous test of patience," said Donelan, recalling how difficult it was to instill even the most basic fundamentals of dining etiquette among those American households living on incomes of $42,000 or less per year. "I finally resorted to withholding their beloved BK Chicken Fries until they learned how to sit properly and make regular use of a napkin." "But eventually, I discovered that aside from their orange cheese flavoring–coated fingers, there was really something quite endearing about them," he continued. "That's when it occurred to me that if poor people could learn to appreciate my culture and culinary preferences, then perhaps I could enjoy their Kid Rock albums and hot wings." Much to his amazement, Donelan said, he discovered he had an affinity for some of their favorite pastimes. Together, he and the nation's poor but charming segment of American society have been seen playing scratch-off lotto tickets and visiting local Circle Ks, and these days, Donelan freely admits he has even become familiar with the names of several well-regarded WWE wrestlers. "I've been doing more cooking with the microwave lately, and I've come to appreciate — even enjoy — eating a warmed-over meal on a sofa in front of this so-called 'Maury,'" Donelan said. "I guess you could say my newfound love for the lower classes has helped me to learn something about myself." "Namely, that I can feel a deep affection for those less fortunate than myself," he added. "As long as they don't ask for any handouts, stay politically unrepresented, and take mandatory drug tests."

Creative Writing Professor Takes Time To Give Every Student Personalized False Hope
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA — In an effort to help his students develop inaccurate perceptions of their talents, University of Virginia creative writing professor Alan Erickson told reporters Monday that he takes the time to provide each and every one of them with personalized false hope. "Every student is different, and even though there may be 30 of them per class, I feel it's important that I make enough time to sit down with them individually to let them know they have a unique voice worth pursuing," said Erickson, explaining that he frequently extends his office hours and often stays after class to meet with students one-on-one to ensure they hear individualized, unfounded optimism about their writing and their prospects within the publishing industry. "It certainly adds a bit to my workload, but providing specific feedback and encouragement really has a huge impact on their confidence. Going that extra mile for your students is what inspires them to follow their dreams." The professor added that his efforts have yielded some notable results, asserting that a number of his most deluded former students have gone on to humiliating, short-lived attempts at writing careers.

NASA Social Media Manager Considers Himself Part Of Team
HOUSTON — Calling it a privilege to work in such a dynamic and collaborative environment, NASA social media manager Dustin Greer, 26, told reporters Wednesday he considers himself fortunate to be a part of the space agency's team. Greer, who for the past four years has helped to maintain NASA's official Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram accounts, is said to go about his job each day under the impression that, as social media manager, he is one of the thousands of men and women working tirelessly to advance humankind's exploration of outer space. "Every day at NASA, we're conducting groundbreaking research and making new discoveries, and it feels incredible being part of something so critical to the future of our society," said Greer, whose job consists of uploading images, copying and pasting text, shortening links to stay under Twitter's 140-character limit, and responding to comments online. "Everyone here — from the guys designing new propulsion methods to our astronauts living aboard the International Space Station — plays an important role, and it takes all of us working together to accomplish our missions." "We really are a well-oiled machine," he continued. "It's enough of a reward just to be surrounded by the type of people who are always challenging and pushing one another to reach greater heights. We really bring out the best in one another." Citing the New Horizons probe's Pluto flyby and the Curiosity rover's landing on Mars as examples, Greer told reporters it was hard not to take immense pride in the landmark achievements he and his colleagues have made since he was first hired to run NASA's social media presence. Greer, who majored in communications at DePaul University and joined NASA after a summer marketing internship with the e-commerce site Groupon, added that behind the agency's awe-inspiring feats are countless long days and sleepless nights that most Americans never see. The employee tasked with curating the agency's LinkedIn page was also quick to point out that at NASA, he and his fellow staff members are always expected to place the mission ahead of their own personal egos. Greer stressed that whether they are gathering data from space telescopes, devising next-generation technologies to enable extraplanetary habitation, or repromoting posts from the agency's Tumblr account, neither he nor his coworkers are concerned with claiming individual credit for their contributions. Furthermore, Greer said, he and the agency's engineers, physicists, and crewmembers were essentially one large family. "Preparing for the last [International Space] Station resupply required all hands on deck," Greer said of the recent mission, which he documented and shared on Twitter and Instagram using the hashtag #NASASocial. "The technicians were working around the clock to monitor the rocket, the meteorologists were closely assessing atmospheric conditions, and the whole time I was juggling tweets covering the launch with that week's Periscope tour of the Kennedy Space Center." "It was so exhausting, but at the same time, it was extremely exciting to have been part of it," he continued. "Especially the moment when I could just step back and watch the posts go live." While stating that he thoroughly enjoys his work, Greer admitted to reporters that with so much at stake in their day-to-day operations, he, like everyone at NASA, tends to place an enormous amount of pressure on himself to avoid letting down his colleagues. The man responsible for posting clips of NASA press conferences to YouTube went on to say that when he is feeling burnt out from the demands of the job, he needs only to remind himself of the millions of young Americans who NASA is inspiring every single day. "What I like most about working here is that although this job is incredibly demanding, I get to show up each day knowing we're really doing something meaningful," said the man who has the ability to queue up several hours' worth of social media posts ahead of time, allowing him to sometimes leave work as early as 2 p.m. "It's enough of a reward just to be surrounded by the type of people who are always challenging and pushing one another to reach greater heights. We really bring out the best in one another." Added Greer: "This job isn't for everyone. It's a high-stress environment, but man, it's such a payoff when we take a look at everything we've accomplished."

Elderly Man Who's Outlived Wife By 8 Years Must Not Have Loved Her Very Much
LAUREL, MD — Noting that the 81-year-old is still in relatively good health to this day, sources reported Monday that elderly man Jonathan Eckman, who has outlived his wife by eight years now, must not have loved her very much. "If he didn't die the day after his wife, or later that year on their wedding anniversary, then he probably didn't really care about her at all," said local acquaintance Dana Ridgely, who added that the least Eckman could have done if he, in fact, cherished and adored the woman he spent 50 years of his life alongside, was die within a few weeks of her. "He vows to be with her forever, he raises three kids with her, and he spends nearly every moment with her for decades, but he doesn't even pass away moments after she does, still holding her hand? He must have been cheating on her or something." Sources added that unless Eckman dies 10 years to the day after his wife's passing, it was almost guaranteed that he never even loved her to begin with and their marriage was one big lie.

Dad Hands Phone Off To Mom Immediately After Being Wished Happy Father's Day
WILLOUGHBY, OH — Allowing no window whatsoever for additional conversation to take place, the father of local man Luke Asbury reportedly handed off the phone to Luke's mother on Sunday immediately after his son wished him a happy Father's Day. "Wow, he didn't waste any time — he just said thanks, told me Mom was there if I wanted to speak to her, and then got off the line before I could really answer," said Asbury, 32, who told reporters that while he in no way expected to chat at length, he did anticipate at least having one or two minutes of small talk about whether his father planned to watch any golf that afternoon. "I don't think we were even on the line together for 30 seconds before he started wrapping things up. In fact, this might've been the earliest he's ever told me he had to get going. I can't imagine he'll be able to top that next year." At press time, Asbury's mother put the call on speaker so they could all talk, though his father reportedly remained silent except for what sounded like shuffling out of the room with the newspaper. He might be a man of few words, but he knows good Scotch Whisky when he sees it. Share Dewar's 12 Year Old Blended Scotch Whisky with Dad this Father's Day. Brought to you by Dewar's Dewar's

U.S. Military Honors Sacrifices Of NFL Players By Wearing Jerseys Throughout December
ARLINGTON, VA — In recognition of the brave and altruistic Americans who risk their health and safety for the greater good, Pentagon officials announced Thursday that the U.S. military would honor the sacrifices of NFL players by wearing their jerseys throughout December. "Every week, these men are out there on the gridiron, putting their bodies on the line for our country. Having our soldiers wear these jerseys and caps is the least we can do to show our support," said Pentagon spokesperson Robert D'Amato, who announced that all active-duty soldiers would be sporting gear from all 32 teams to raise awareness of the people who put their lives aside to preserve the American way of life. "These men leave their homes and their families and travel to cities across the country to uphold our nation's traditions. They are battered and bruised for years, their lives often cut short while we sit back in our barracks and enjoy our freedom. Some of them are never the same after they end their service, and yet we take them for granted. Hopefully, this small gesture shows that the soldiers and officers of the U.S. military know who the true heroes really are."

New 'Call Of Duty' Career Mode Lets Player Join Raytheon's Board Of Directors After Military Service
SANTA MONICA, CA — Introducing an update aimed at heightening the realism of the game, Activision announced Wednesday that a new career mode for Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4 allows playable characters who retire from the military to continue the fight by joining Raytheon's board of directors. "Players who rack up enough confirmed kills in combat will now be able to take their adventure to the next level as they join a $50 billion company with the mission of building lethal weapons systems and maximizing profits for shareholders," said Activision spokesperson Adam Bera, acknowledging this version of career mode tested better with gamers than a beta version in which the player is a discharged soldier who returns to his hometown, discovers there are few jobs available, and struggles to make ends meet. "Points are earned in career mode by attending meetings, securing hundreds of millions of dollars in Defense Department contracts, and appearing on cable news programs to fend off bad public relations for the military-industrial complex. Our award-winning developers even worked closely with current and former Raytheon executives to make sure all the golfing side quests in the game are as true to life as possible." Bera went on to reveal that if Call Of Duty players beat career mode with 100% of achievements, they will be able to unlock Erik Prince as a playable character.

Man Pretty Cocky Since Beating Cancer
FT. LAUDERDALE, FL — Whether he's bragging about his newfound appreciation for life or arrogantly refusing to take anything for granted, local man Daniel Oretsky, 38, has been acting insufferably cocky since winning his two-year battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sources confirmed Tuesday. Oretsky, who can't even go five minutes without rubbing everyone's face in his gratitude for being alive, has reportedly taken every possible opportunity to pat himself on the back for being cancer-free for the first time since 2013. "Since beating cancer, I feel like I have a new lease on life," boasted Oretsky during yet another of his unbelievably self-aggrandizing stories about having a normal white blood cell count. "I feel great, and my energy and appetite are back — even just doing mundane things like taking a walk or doing the dishes have this added significance now that I'm healthy." "Mainly, I'm going to focus on making the most of whatever time I have left on earth," the self-centered showboat continued, once again subjecting everyone within earshot to another one of his overbearing, obnoxious vows not to waste the second chance he's been given. "When you get through something like this, it really changes your perspective. You understand what's truly important in life." Not content to gloat and strut about in front of just those in his immediate vicinity, the haughty, self-important prick says he plans to seek out the biggest audience he can get by starting a blog to advise and comfort others who are currently going through the same ordeal he went through. Since returning to work last week, the pretentious blowhard has reportedly not been shy about discussing what he vainly refers to as his "journey." Sources confirmed that, when asked, the egomaniac won't hesitate to drone on about himself endlessly, talking about how he lost nearly 80 pounds during treatment or how he is just so humbled by the support of his loved ones, barely letting anyone else get a word in edgewise. "At my lowest, it was tough going, for sure," the out-of-control narcissist said, implying in so many words that everyone should bow down to his greatness for dealing with months of radiation treatments, chemotherapy, and daily medications. "But I would think of my family and how I wasn't done spending time with them yet. That's what got me through." Not content to gloat and strut about in front of just those in his immediate vicinity, the haughty, self-important prick says he plans to seek out the biggest audience he can get by starting a blog to advise and comfort others who are currently going through the same ordeal he went through. Additionally, Oretsky, who at one point was given a 50-50 chance of survival, has wasted no time ramming his new life goals straight down everyone's throats. Pompously citing his "clean bill of health," the smug fuck is said to be incredibly adept at bringing any conversation back around to his selfish plans to travel to Europe, learn another language, and still be around to see his children graduate from college. "If this experience has taught me one thing, it's that we have to live our lives without regret," said Oretsky, who amazingly was still able to speak, given how far he was up his own ass. "Because one day when you least expect it, it could all be taken away." "We only have this one life," Mr. Look-At-Me-I-Beat-Cancer added, flashing his trademark shit-eating grin. "We have to make the most of it." At press time, the unbearable asshole was asking friends, coworkers, and loved ones to sponsor him for an upcoming cancer walk as though it were a foregone conclusion they'd agree.

How To Keep Your Personal Information Secure
Encrypt any important paperwork in a three-speed blender. Make sure the only people who have access to your personal identification, such as birth certificates and social security numbers, are you and a string of old landlords. Monitor your credit card statements to make sure the only unusual purchases are the ones you made on Amazon while drunk. Never provide personal details to anyone you don't know, such as EMTs and firefighters.

How To Find The Right Therapist
Start by gathering referrals. Pinpoint your least broken friend and ask who they go to. Do your homework. Some research into available options will help you find a good fit for the specific needs of your insurance provider. A good therapist will honor the ethical principles of their field, particularly when it comes to not ratting out patients to the police for entirely unintentional hit-and-runs. If you can't afford a conventional psychologist, consider a university clinic, church group, or supportive subreddit. It helps to keep in mind that therapists are ultimately just people, meaning these sessions will also be an inescapable nightmare. Prepare to laugh your face off, cry, and maybe fall in love.

Mom Guesses Dressbarn Closure Means She'll Just Have To Go Shop With All The Sluts Over At Chico's Now
HAMMOND, IN — Saying Dressbarn's sudden closure had left her bereft of stylish-yet-modest clothing options, local mom Susan Bell reportedly guessed Tuesday that she'll just have to go shop with all those sluts over at Chico's now. "I hope I don't catch the clap rubbing elbows with all those Chico's tramps while I'm trying to buy a flowy maxi dress or thigh-length cardigan," said Bell, looking aghast as she scanned the Chico's website for flattering blouses that wouldn't "leave my tits popping out all over the place." "Tank tops, leopard-print ponchos, high-waisted palazzo pants; what am I, some red-mouthed whore? That floozy Kathleen Meyer and her wino friends all shop at Chico's, and they're always whoring up the Rotary Club meetings. I can't let anyone see me shopping there or they'll think I'm one of those tarts." At press time, Bell had returned from Talbots empty handed, announcing she wasn't about to spend $200 to dress like grandma.

Disconcerted Woman Has No Memory Of Telling Dressing Room Attendant Her Name
CHICAGO — Confused and unsettled after an employee at the clothing retailer called her by her name, area woman Christine Forberg, 28, confirmed she had no memory of telling the dressing room attendant at a local Gap store who she was. "She unlocked a dressing room for me and said 'Let me know if you need any other sizes, Christine,' which was weird, because I swear I didn't introduce myself," said the visibly shaken Forberg, carefully reconstructing every moment she'd spent in the store thus far — from entering it, to selecting a pair of size-eight dress slacks, to approaching the fitting rooms — to assure herself she hadn't at any point given the woman her name. "She even wrote 'Christine' on the little chalkboard on the door. And then, when she came back a few minutes later with a shirt she thought I'd like, she called me 'Ms. Forberg'! At first I thought maybe I was still wearing my ID badge from work, but nope. What the hell?" At press time, reports confirmed Forberg had made a hasty exit from the store after the clerk referred to her by a private nickname thought to be known only to her boyfriend.

Woman Toys With Idea Of Getting Sister Something Nice They Can Do Together As Gift Before Settling On Candle
PORTSMOUTH, NH — Entertaining dozens of options in her search for the perfect birthday gift, local 27-year-old Alison Levine reportedly spent Friday toying with getting her sister something nice they could do together before settling on a candle. "At first I thought I'd get her a gift certificate so we could bond at a pottery class or something, but then I saw this lavender-scented candle, and I'm pretty sure she likes candles," said Levine, who had immediately dropped plans to buy craft supplies to make a scrapbook with her sister after spotting the $28 glass jar candle at Anthropologie. "Obviously, it would've been cool to get in some quality time with Mary at a spa or pedicure. On the other hand, this candle was on sale, and who can't use a candle?" At press time, Levine was playing with the possibility of suggesting that she and her sister could take turns lighting the candle and blowing it out.

Exhausted Amazon Customer Forced To Piss In Bottle While Browsing Prime Day Deals
NEW YORK — Frantically searching through the latest lightning deals and price slashes while sitting in his darkened room, Amazon customer Franklin Harris was reportedly forced to piss in a bottle Monday in order to keep up with Prime Day deals. "Christ, I've been busting my ass scrolling through deals for 12 hours already, but I just know if I step away to the bathroom for even a second, Amazon will be all over me about some KitchenAid Stand Mixer that's half-off," said Harris before grabbing an empty Aquafina bottle from a shelf cluttered with dozens of already half-filled containers of urine and relieving himself, reportedly never breaking eye contact with his monitor for fear of the consequences of missing rebates on Samsonite Luggage sets and Toshiba Fire TVs. "My whole body aches from constantly clicking and sitting. I'm dehydrated, I haven't seen the sun in days, and, frankly, I'm probably buying way more items on discount than any person should be expected to. But what am I supposed to do? Amazon is just goddamn relentless about these deals." At press time, Harris was spotted shaking his head in dismay and pulling on an adult diaper after an email arrived in his inbox reminding him about a limited-time offer for Garmin Wearable GPS devices.

Man Told He'd Never Make It As Pro Defies Them All By Sucking For 4 Years In AA Ball
HARTFORD, CT — Dedicating his next ground out to all the people who tried to keep him down, minor leaguer Adam Brosseau confirmed Monday that he had defied everyone who said he'd never make it as a professional baseball player by sucking for four years in Double-A. "They said I'd never make it back in high school, but now I'm getting paid $1,700 a month to chase my dreams. I can't wait to see the looks on all their faces when they see me out there with the Hartford Yard Goats," said Brosseau, 27, who claimed everyone who told him to give up on baseball must feel pretty embarrassed after watching him bounce around to five separate farm teams. "I bet all those haters are sitting at their desk jobs right now, watching me get stranded on second base and thinking 'Man, we were stupid for doubting Adam.' They swore I'd never amount to anything, but look who's getting the last laugh. How many of them could hit 120 pop flies over the course of three seasons?" At press time, Brosseau was confronting his latest doubter by asking the manager at Home Depot not to fire him and promising he would not be late for another shift again.

"Don't waste your money on any of that stuff they're hawking out there," said Bush, who reportedly took John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and Newt Gingrich aside to emphasize that the pills were "really weak shit." "You get your hopes up. You think, 'Wow, $35 Cialis?' But it's bunk. If you want the good stuff, you gotta pay for it." At press time, Bush was again making the rounds to inform everyone the Levitra he had acquired from a guy backstage had turned out to be "absolutely primo."

Ted Cruz Asks Central Park Hansom Cab Driver How Much It Costs To Whip Horse For An Hour
NEW YORK — Saying the activity seemed like the perfect way to spend some free time while he was visiting Manhattan, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz reportedly asked a hansom cab driver in Central Park Tuesday how much it would cost to whip his horse for one hour. "Excuse me, sir, beauty of a horse you've got. How much are you charging to flog it for an hour or so?" said the Texas senator, who quickly clarified that he did not want to go anywhere or even sit in the carriage, but would instead prefer to beat the horse with a riding crop at his leisure for a period of 60 minutes. "Ever since I was little, I've dreamed about thrashing a hansom cab horse in Central Park. I can't wait to give it a couple good whacks on the face. I'm trying to really experience all New York has to offer while I'm here." After he was turned down by the driver, Cruz reportedly told onlookers he would instead head down to the Central Park pond to feed on the ducks.

"C'mon, I can barely make out what Trump's talking about," said Cruz, leaning forward in his seat in section 417 to better see whether the president's rally appearance in support of him was going well or not. "I think that little speck next to him on the stage is my wife and kids? But back here, who knows? God, I just hope they're saying good things about me." At press time, Cruz was spotted being escorted out of the venue by security after attempting to move to a better seat midway through the rally.

Brutal Anti-Cruz Attack Ad Just 30 Seconds Of Candidate's Photo Displayed Without Any Text, Voiceover, Music
RALEIGH, NC — In what many political observers are calling a new low in an election season that has already seen its share of negative campaigning, a scathing anti–Ted Cruz attack ad airing this week reportedly shows nothing more than a still photograph of the Texas senator's face for 30 seconds, unaccompanied by any text, voiceover, or music. The pointed TV spot — which continues on in complete silence and does not pan across or zoom in on the candidate's face, but merely holds steady on the image for half a minute before fading to black — is said to be running in several states with upcoming primaries and is paid for by a super PAC opposed to Cruz's presidential bid. "This is an extremely vicious jab at Ted Cruz, and one that succeeds in painting the candidate in a most unfavorable light," said Douglas Reisenthaler, a senior analyst with Public Policy Polling, who described the ad as by far the most unrelenting and hostile attack to air since the 2016 election cycle began. "Inevitably, some voters will be turned off by the maliciousness of showing an unretouched headshot of Ted Cruz on television screens across America, but it has nonetheless proved very effective in turning public opinion against his candidacy." He added, "Everywhere this ad has aired, Cruz's numbers have gone into complete free-fall." The Cruz campaign has been vocal in its criticism of what it describes as an underhanded smear tactic, with spokeswoman Alice Stewart saying the televised photo not only crosses the line, but is also difficult to watch. While admitting some amount of mudslinging is to be expected in a competitive race at the national level, she called airing a static image of Cruz's bare countenance without interruption for the full duration of an ad "sick" and "truly repulsive." A representative from the organization responsible for the commercial, Believe in Liberty PAC, defended its actions, noting that while attack ads often digitally alter photographs to make a candidate appear more unflattering or even menacing, the picture it used of the 45-year-old presidential hopeful was completely undoctored and thus did not misrepresent or mislead in any way. Regardless, many viewers told reporters they found the anti-Cruz commercial inexcusable. "It's absolutely revolting, and I can't believe they would run something like that on television," said Dorothy Chalmers, a Dillsboro, NC mother who saw the ad with her three small children. "I immediately turned it off, of course, but I had to talk with my kids about what we had just seen. It was so nasty and unpleasant, my youngest one started to cry. Is this the kind of low-blow campaigning we can expect to endure through November?" "After watching the ad, though, I definitely won't be voting for Ted Cruz," she continued. "How could you after seeing that?"

Trump Announces He'll Pay Legal Fees Of Any Rally Attendee Who Beats Up Ted Cruz
HOUSTON — In an effort to whip up excitement at an event for the Texas senator's reelection campaign, President Donald Trump announced to the rally crowd Monday that he would pay the legal fees of any attendee who beats up Ted Cruz. "I promise you this, folks — if anybody here knocks the crap out of Ted Cruz, I will pay whatever it costs," said Trump to raucous cheering from the Toyota Center audience as he demonstrated several moves, including a body slam, a chokehold, and an uppercut punch, that a supporter could use on the one-term senator. "I mean, just look this guy. That's a real bad dude, folks, and he's just asking for it. We don't want this kind of guy here at this rally, believe me. Six figures, seven figures — I don't care how much. I'll pay for it. If you want to take a swing at him right now, be my guest." At press time, Cruz had announced he would match the legal fees Trump donated to anyone who punched him in the face.

Millions Of Americans Succumbing To Sudden Elder Death Syndrome
McLEAN, VA — Despite remarkable advances in health care and the study of medicine in recent decades, scientists remain baffled by Sudden Elder Death Syndrome, a disorder that cuts long lives short and leaves aggrieved loved ones wondering why. Also known as Craftmatic Adjustable Bed Death, SEDS is the sudden, unexplained passing of an elderly person. In many SEDS cases, even a full autopsy and a review of 80-plus years of health records cannot account for the mysterious death. "We have no forensic explanation for it," said Dr. Martin Gerrard, chairman of the SEDS Institute. "These seemingly healthy elders — some of whom are performing such normal activities as eating liquefied food, trying to stand up, or taking frequent naps — just stop breathing. According to a study published by the SEDS Institute, Sudden Elder Death Syndrome is the leading cause of death among people over the age of 85. Nicolai Korsgaard, author of the most comprehensive SEDS investigation conducted in the past decade, said scientists have been unable to replicate his results because study participants often succumb to SEDS before the studies are complete. "Over 99 percent of elders between the ages of 100 and 105 die of SEDS," Korsgaard said. "As a researcher and caregiver, I can't think of a scenario more gut-wrenching than that of a healthy and contented centenarian slipping into a deep slumber and never awakening. The earliest recorded SEDS fatality occurred on American soil in 1661, when 58-year-old English-born colonist Jonas Clay died in his sleep in his cabin. While advances in mattress technology and elder care have raised the average age of SEDS victims from 54.5 in 1700 to 78.6 today, the mysterious syndrome kills at exactly the same rate it did three centuries ago. "Doctors haven't isolated any genetic anomalies or behavior patterns among elders afflicted with SEDS," Gerrard said. "The one constant in the SEDS community is age. We do know that the older one gets, the greater the risk of becoming a victim. However, independent research group SEDS Prevention Alliance has detected patterns among SEDS victims. "Nearly 80 percent of SEDS deaths occur in a home setting, such as a nursing home or assisted-living facility," said SEDSPA director Melinda Byrnes. "Inactive elders who lie in their beds all day ingesting prescription medicines are especially susceptible. For many loved ones of SEDS victims, however, these and other theories offer little comfort. Atlanta resident Mary-Beth Soltis, 34, lost her grandmother Esther, 91, to SEDS in 2003. "Every day, I think, 'There must have been something I could have done to save Nana,'" Soltis said. "When I left the hospital the night before, I never thought that it would be the last time I saw her. What did I do wrong? I'm a terrible granddaughter. Byrnes recommends putting elders to sleep on their backs, checking on them regularly, and monitoring them with a device called an electrocardiograph, which emits a sustained electronic tone if your elder is in danger of succumbing to SEDS.

Ted Cruz Attempts To Connect With Voters By Wearing More Handsome Man's Face As Mask
DALLAS — In an effort to make himself more appealing to voters, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) reportedly tried to connect with the audience at a candidate forum Tuesday by wearing the bloody, skinned face of a far more handsome man as a mask. "People are really responding to this new, dapper Ted Cruz," said campaign manager Jeff Roe, noting that recent internal polls show that since Cruz adopted the new look, voters are twice as likely to describe the expressionless, gore-covered incumbent as "trustworthy," "affable," or "charming." "That rough-cut mask of rotting skin is doing wonders for the senator on the campaign trail. He's honestly never looked better, and the voters are really beginning to take notice. Even with the stench of decomposition, most people we talk to remark upon how Sen. Cruz doesn't make them feel as nauseous as he used to. He's looking a lot healthier, too." Roe later confirmed that while Cruz's current mask was rapidly decaying, the candidate had a freezer filled with enough handsome and blood-encrusted masks of human skin to last him through the campaign's final stretch.

Patriotism FTW: 'Call Of Duty: Mobile' Will Now Only Allow Guns To Be Used By Players On American Side
When Activision first released Call Of Duty: Mobile early this month, fans were psyched to have the iconic first-player shooter optimized for Android and iPhone. Now it looks like there's even more to get excited about, because the developers just revealed that an upcoming update for the game will only allow players on the American side to wield or use firearms. Hell yeah! This is a huge win for patriotic fans who loved Call Of Duty, but always wished the enemies of freedom had no recourse to fight back against our troops. "We've listened to the overwhelming feedback of fans who considered it disrespectful that you could shoot and even kill American combatants in the game, and we've corrected this issue to make Call Of Duty: Mobile better than ever before," Activision CEO Robert Kotick told OGN in an interview, confirming that while the updated game would continue to feature terrorists from around the globe, this version will give proper reverence to the sacrifices of the Founding Fathers by making every service member fighting on the American side completely invulnerable. "Call Of Duty fans will get the same pulse-pounding action they've come to expect as they slaughter the unarmed, fleeing opponents who despise our way of life," he added. "Meanwhile, those fighting against the American forces will be provided with a fresh range of options like never before, such as diving headfirst in front of a tank or attempting to pick up a grenade only to have it immediately explode in their hands." Kotick went on to get gamers even more excited about another update in early 2020 that would strip enemy combatants of all options except for getting down on their knees, crying, and begging for mercy from America's great liberators. USA! USA! These colors don't run, baby!

'Low-Energy Jeb,' Whispers Jeb Bush Sitting Alone In Dark Watching Televised Trump Speech
CORAL GABLES, FL — Staring unblinkingly ahead Thursday night as Donald Trump's presidential acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention played on the television in front of him, former GOP candidate Jeb Bush reportedly whispered "Low-Energy Jeb" to himself while sitting alone in the dark. "Low-Energy Jeb; Low-Energy Jeb," the two-term governor of Florida is said to have quietly mumbled under his breath, his expressionless, stubble-covered face and stained T-shirt lit only by the flickering glow of the TV set while he sat on the sofa in his basement rec room, a day-old and half-empty Chinese food takeout container sitting on the side table next to him as he fixedly watched his former competitor in the presidential race speak to a packed arena. "Weak candidate. Weak. By far the weakest of the lot." At press time, a faint smile had curled across the onetime presidential frontrunner's chapped lips as he muttered a fully memorized victory speech aloud, thanking the people of Iowa for their resounding support and telling a nonexistent crowd of supporters that they had launched him on his path to the White House.

'Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Cast Members Clock Into Amazon Warehouse For Mandatory Black Friday Overtime Shift
BROOKLYN, NY — As they donned jumpsuits and prepared to meet their employer's relentless performance quotas, the cast members of Emmy-winning TV show The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel reportedly clocked in this morning to begin their mandatory 12-hour Black Friday shift at a local Amazon warehouse. "Listen, none of us like having to come in the day after Thanksgiving, but if you want to work for Amazon, those are the rules," said series star Rachel Brosnahan, who signed in with show creator and temporary floor foreman Amy Sherman-Palladino before firing up one of the many forklifts the cast and crew of Amazon's flagship comedy would be using to meet consumers' holiday demands. "Don't get me wrong, I like making some extra cash, but they do that thing where they say overtime is optional, and then if you don't volunteer for it, they cut your screen time next season. It can be pretty tough. Last year, [series co-star] Tony [Shalhoub] threw his back out, and the rest of us had to pick up the slack or the whole team would have had its pay docked." At press time, sources confirmed John Krasinski had been written up for failing to scan 300 warehouse items per hour, causing Amazon to fire him from his starring role in Jack Ryan.

Death Of Parents Boosts Area Woman's Self-Esteem
SAVANNAH, GA — In the wake of the Aug. 12, 2004 death of her parents Hugh and Patricia, Leah Sawyer's self-esteem has skyrocketed, sources close to the 27-year-old said Monday. "When her parents died, I thought for sure the terrible experience would send timid little Leah right over the edge," Sawyer's 31-year-old cousin Edie Holt said. "But somehow, she's handling the tragedy really well. If I didn't know that this dreadful thing had just happened to her, I would say that Leah was the happiest I've ever seen her. Less than a year since a semi-truck broadsided Sawyer's parents' Saturn Ion on Interstate 516, Sawyer seems "healthy, fulfilled, and confident," Holt said. "Leah seems to be adjusting just fine, even though her life is vastly different from the one she had been living at home with her parents in the suburbs," Holt said. "I got the impression that Aunt Patricia and Uncle Hugh could be quite critical and controlling sometimes. And I know she wasn't thrilled about the hotel-management job Uncle Hugh had found for her, either. "Oh," Holt added quickly, "but I'm sure that Leah would give up her new job and her new condo downtown just to hear her parents speak to her one more time. I mean, of course. Within two months of the tragic car accident, Sawyer quit her job, put the longtime family home on the market, and sold most of her parents' possessions. "We were initially worried that Leah was being a bit rash," Holt said. "Everyone remembered how she'd been such a homebody. I mean, she barely ever left her room. We feared that she might be having some sort of nervous breakdown as a result of her grief. "But Leah told me in the calmest of tones that, for her, the one real way that she could move on was by moving out, so to speak," Holt said. "And, after unloading all of her dad's beloved fishing poles and her mom's macramé supplies at an estate sale in a single weekend, that's just what she did. Many friends and relatives said they noted Sawyer's fortitude at the funeral. "We were all very impressed that Leah volunteered to deliver the eulogy, since she'd always been so shy at family gatherings," said Natalie Demirdjian, Sawyer's aunt. "But at the funeral, she was very composed and she spoke so positively about her parents' new life in heaven. She spoke movingly about how Hugh and Patricia had journeyed on to a place free of worries and hassles, where they would be 'forever young and without complaints.' Then she described death as a way for the bereaved to start anew, and how 'bright flowers would bloom on scorched and sour earth.' It was quite inspiring. "It must have done her good to speak from her heart, because when she walked away from that podium, Leah looked a foot taller," Demirdjian said. "It was as though a giant burden had been lifted from her shoulders. Although her inheritance could have allowed her to retreat from public life, Sawyer plunged headfirst into new pursuits. "I was stunned when [Leah] told me she was taking motorcycle lessons," Sawyer's friend Betsy Pfaff said. "She said that, since she's proven that she can read the paper at the kitchen table without leaving dirty smudges all over the tablecloth, maybe she can also climb on a motorcycle without suffering permanent brain damage. I didn't really get what she meant, but she's been through a lot lately, so I didn't question her. Pfaff added: "I also let it go when she said, 'You don't think wearing red makes me look like a whore, do you?' Pfaff said her surprise redoubled after she asked Sawyer to help her manage her small used-book store. "I really needed an extra hand, but I didn't have a lot of money to pay Leah," Pfaff said. "I didn't want to take advantage of her while she was in such a fragile emotional state, but Leah said the low pay was fine because she really loved the store. She told me, 'Sure, Mom and Dad wouldn't have approved of me working for peanuts, but we can't live in the past, can we?' Pfaff said the new independence must be good for her friend, because she's noticed that Sawyer's complexion is clearer than it has been in years, her frame looks about 15 pounds lighter, and she has begun to attract the attention of men. "Leah used to say she didn't date because she was holding out for the type of guy her father would approve of," Pfaff said. "She'd never found that guy in all the years I knew her, though. I guess her luck must've turned around. Last week, Sawyer went on a date with bookstore patron Seth Westphal, 30, who said he was attracted to her "optimistic attitude and big, sunny smile. "Over dinner, I told Leah, 'You seem to have a lot of energy,'" Westphal said. "Leah smiled, turned a little red and said, 'Yeah, well, my parents died in August.'" Family physician Dr. Jack Meyerling, who has known the Sawyer family for nearly 30 years, said that, while it is not unusual for a bereaved person to resent his or her deceased loved ones for departing so suddenly, Sawyer appears to have "made peace" with her situation. "Psychologists have isolated five stages of mourning: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance," Meyerling said. "But, after spending a very brief time in the initial stage, Leah skipped the middle three and very swiftly zeroed in on the fifth. Added Meyerling, "Actually, in Leah's case, I would propose adding a sixth stage: welcoming.

ER Doctor Excitedly Tells Wife He Got To Use Shock Paddle Thing Today
SHREVEPORT, LA — Unable to contain his enthusiasm as he burst through the front door, emergency room doctor Barry Henke excitedly told his wife Monday that he got to use those shock paddle things today. "You'll never believe it, honey — I finally did that thing with those electric paddles at work!" said an ecstatic Henke, adding that he couldn't have been more thrilled to order everyone to get out of the way as he rushed over to the patient while rubbing the shock doohickies together. "I've been wanting to play with those thingies since my first day, and I finally got to! I put them on the guy's chest, yelled 'Clear!' and they went bzzzzzzzz just like they do on TV! Boy, I hope I can do it again soon!" Henke went on to say that it was the most fun he's ever had on the job, even though the guy died.

Walgreens Unveils New Line Of Shrink-Wrapped Sandwiches To Grab When Something Has Gone Horribly, Horribly Wrong
CHICAGO — Catering to a segment of the population chronically underserved by man and God alike, Walgreens unveiled a new line of shrink-wrapped sandwiches Tuesday for the doomed, afflicted, and beleaguered to purchase in times when things have gone horribly, horribly wrong. "These inexpensive, tightly shrink-wrapped, alternately soggy or dried-out sandwiches are ideal for those whose lives have taken a sudden and unimaginably tragic turn," said Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina, who noted his company's colorless sandwiches would come in a variety of nearly anonymous dreary flavors such as "turkey with warm iceberg lettuce" and "ham with semi-solid cheese" and that all sandwiches would be packaged with a limp pickle spear, one unlabeled packet of an extremely pale yellow condiment, and a vague sense of futility. "Whether you're eating one on the go while heading to a miserable job, avoiding several outstanding warrants for failure to pay child support, or just don't value yourself very highly, our sandwiches are slapped together in a way that's guaranteed to make you wonder exactly why your body needs to continue on. Has everyone you once cared about now abandoned you? Are you down to your last $3 in loose change? Walgreens now has the perfect egg salad sandwich or plain hot dog to accompany speculation at exactly how low rock bottom can go. And if you're at the end of the line, but you're still not sure you want to step over it, why not think that over while forcing down a crumbling meatball sub from the room-temperature cooler we put across from the generic cough medicine and foot powder? Hell, grab a nice warm yogurt, too. You're worth it." Pessina also noted that Walgreens had won the legal battle to call its shrink-wrapped raw fish meals "sushi," but recommended that customers refrain from eating them until they were fully committed to killing themselves.

RoseArt Recalls Colored Pencils After Hundreds Of Kids Sucked Into Magical Drawing World
LIVINGSTON, NJ — Warning parents about the dangers of a powerful imagination, RoseArt announced Thursday a recall of all colored pencils after hundreds of children were sucked into magical drawing worlds of their own creation. "We received nearly 800 reports of children being swept up in a vortex of bright colors and pulled into their sketchpad, where they became trapped in the fanciful illustrations they had drawn using our product," said spokesperson Belinda Clarke, adding that, effective immediately, consumers must provide valid ID to purchase RoseArt supplies and that all boxes of colored pencils would now include a warning label urging the user to exercise extreme caution when sketching. "Children have been injured and, yes, even killed inside their enchanted pictures while battling robots and dragons, crashing nonfunctional 7-wheeled vehicles, or drowning in bodies of water after failing to draw a shoreline. We can only imagine the horror a parent must feel to pick up a notepad and discover a rendering of their child banging against the page. Please supervise your children's drawing time, and if at all possible, teach them how to draw a weapon so they can defend themselves if they end up stuck inside a fantastical world where everything they draw comes to life." Clarke also confirmed that RoseArt would not offer refunds to adult consumers who drew erotic images in hopes of getting pulled into a sexy illustrated dreamscape.

Bounty Unveils New Ultra-Thin Paper Towels For More Natural Feeling While Wiping Up Spills
CINCINNATI — Promising a more palpable, tactile way to clean up everything from the smallest, most intimate spills to the largest and most textured of messes, Bounty officials unveiled a new line of new ultra-thin paper towels Wednesday designed to provide a more natural feeling while wiping up household spills. "With Bounty Ultra-Thin, wipers who sop up a puddle of soda or dab a red wine stain dry will feel like nothing comes between them and their spills," a press release from Bounty read in part, also noting that the thick, numbing sensation of using standard paper towels made it impossible to feel the satisfyingly wet, warm sensations of cleaning hot coffee from a countertop. "When using Bounty Ultra-Thin Paper Towels, you feel every carrot, every pea, every noodle in your upended soup almost as if it's right there pressing up against your skin. And our premium high-quality materials ensure that there is no need to worry about tearing, so you can feel free to wipe and wipe and wipe any surface you want while getting your sloppy mess off." Bounty also released a line of Magnum oversized paper towels for hands larger than 8 inches.

Alex Jones Returns To Humble Roots Of Screaming Conspiracy Theories Through Megaphone At People In Park
AUSTIN, TX — Acknowledging that his recent removal from several major media platforms may be for the best, noted conspiracy theorist and InfoWars host Alex Jones returned to his humble roots Monday screaming conspiracy theories through a megaphone at people in the park. "Although having my show and podcasts taken down by elitist liberal tech companies like YouTube and Apple is part of the growing feminization of our country, it's ultimately going to backfire on them, because now I'm free to get back to the thing that launched my career — screaming crucial information about chemtrails and the gay agenda into the faces of unsuspecting park visitors," said Jones as he eagerly approached a group of jump-roping children to shriek at them about the rise of tuberculosis in Chobani yogurt. "Sure, getting to film my show in a nice big indoor studio is great, but I feel I'd lost some of the passion that comes from hollering at people up close while they try to enjoy a picnic or play a game of bocce ball. I used to wake up in the bushes almost every day, my piss-soaked pants bunched around my ankles, my mouth already shouting at passersby and trees about white genocide. I've long since paid my dues as a leading conservative pundit. But once my show took off, I couldn't help but think that I'd lost a little of that human connection that only comes from seeing the flecks of your own spit on a stranger's face as you tell them, your voice distorted from the amplification, about the false flag operations where crisis actors try to take away our guns. And there's just no feeling quite like the rush of climbing to the top of the jungle gym, the sweet ache of your throat lining tearing as you scream at parents and kids about autistic Muppets, the heat of the sun-warmed playground equipment seeping into your flushed nude body." At press time, Jones was being escorted from Austin's Balcones Public Park by police officers after an unsuccessful attempt to sell his Child Ease supplements to a family celebrating their daughter's birthday.

Raid Introduces New Lilliputian Repellant Spray
RACINE, WI — Claiming the new product was up to 99.9% effective in just the first 48 hours, Raid introduced a new repellant spray Friday specifically designed to rid living spaces of invasive Lilliputians. "Our proprietary formula will kill every single one of those tiny nuisance humans in mere minutes and completely eradicate a colony of up to 100 miniature families in minutes flat," said S.C. Johnson CEO Herbert Fisk Johnson III, adding that disposal of the diminutive corpses was "a breeze" compared to the mess made by traditional methods such as stomping on, smoking out, or urinating on the habitats of the one-twelfth-scale humanoid vermin. "Long gone are the days of waking up tied to your bed and waiting in fear for some overpriced exterminator to come by and free you. A single can of Raid Miniature Human Spray is enough to drive away or even kill an entire colony of the bastards before they can seize you on trumped-up charges and haul you laboriously before their emperor, who will no doubt sentence you to be blinded in some kangaroo court. We also sell traps in the shape of little houses so that just one of those conniving imps bringing crumbs of food to their village is sufficient for the whole lot of them to be annihilated. No longer must homeowners wildly swing hammers at their feet while the cunning wee men tie their shoelaces together." Raid also introduced a napalm-enhanced version of the formula, packaged in 9,000-gallon tanker-truck-sized dispensers, designed to eliminate Brobdingnagian infestations.

Bob Iger Offers Rupert Murdoch One Night With Mickey Mouse In Exchange For 21st Century Fox
BURBANK, CA — Revealing that it was the provision that essentially sealed the multi-billion dollar deal, sources reported Thursday that Disney Company CEO Bob Iger offered Rupert Murdoch one night with Mickey Mouse in exchange for 21st Century Fox. "To help sweeten our $52.4 billion proposal, we offered Mr. Murdoch access to Mickey for a single-night encounter, which he eagerly accepted," said Iger, explaining that after signing the deal, Murdoch was given the keys to a penthouse suite at the Hotel Bel Air, where he would find two complimentary bottles of Krug Champagne and a fully disrobed Mickey Mouse waiting for him. "Mr. Murdoch was very amenable to our overtures. He even offered to cut the sale price in half for an entire week of companionship, but we are steadfast in protecting the exclusivity of Mickey's attention." Iger went on to say that it was far easier to negotiate this deal than the one struck for Lucasfilm, for which George Lucas demanded an evening with all seven dwarfs.

Chicago Public Schools Celebrate Fifth Straight Day Without Any Student Violence
CHICAGO — Jubilant Chicago Public Schools officials announced Friday that, for five straight days now, there has not been a single act of student violence in any of the city's 675 public schools.

"We've had no incidents of weapons being brought onto school property, nor has anyone had to break up a fistfight between students. We've all had to work together for this, but it's paid off. Let's keep it up!" At press time, a gunfight on Chicago's South Side had reportedly claimed the lives of three 16-year-old boys.

Fitbit Releases New Tracking Collar That Gets Tighter Every Second You Are Inactive
SAN FRANCISCO — Touting the device's state-of-the-art ability to incentivize exercise through intimidation, Fitbit released a new tracking collar Tuesday that tightens every second the person wearing it is inactive. "Whether you're a fitness guru or a first-time runner, this sleek new wearable tech will jumpstart any routine by clamping around your throat and slowly restricting air from passing through your windpipe any time you take a break," said the company's CEO James Park, who added that for many customers, the fear of strangulation is just what they need to adopt a more active lifestyle. "To use the device, all you'll have to do is secure the unbreakable lock around your neck, turn on the pulse monitor, and start moving. Don't stop for any reason, though, because pausing for 10 seconds is more than enough time for the collar to leave you writhing on the ground, dying of hypoxia." At press time, Park added that although it technically was exercise, the device would not log any movements affiliated with trying to rip off the collar.

Responsible Gym Member Makes Sure To Wipe Down Personal Trainer After Workout
ANNANDALE, VA — Saying it was just "common courtesy" to sanitize them for whoever exercised next, local man Nick Dukas told reporters Thursday that he always makes sure to wipe down his personal trainer after working out. "I sweat all over, so it would be pretty rude of me not to at least clean the fitness instructor up before hitting the locker room," said Dukas as he wiped the surface of the muscular, over-six-foot-tall exercise consultant with a disposable disinfecting cloth, explaining how gross it was to start a workout session when your fitness guru was all smelly and covered in germs. "Not only is it important to prevent the spread of bacteria and infections, but also, disinfecting his hands and feet only takes two seconds. I remember using a guy named Daniel once after somebody forgot to clean him, and I got the nastiest rash." At press time, Dukas added that after wiping down his personal trainer, he always makes sure to put him back in the correct spot on the rack.

"Oh my God, how long have my slacks, shirt, vest, and suit jacket been on backwards with my tie hanging down behind me like that?" said Metz, who admitted "feeling like a total jackass" for simply failing to notice that his lapels weren't in front like they were supposed to be and the back of his collar was pressed up around his throat. "I must have been really out of it when I dressed myself this morning. How did I even get my belt buckled without figuring out something was off? Oh, no. I just realized I was dressed like this for my big quarterly sales presentation. Well, with any luck, nobody noticed." At press time, Metz had yet to realize that the computer problems he had suffered through all day were the result of trying to type with his shoes on the wrong hands.

Minnesota Resident Thinking Of Finally Packing It All Up And Moving Someplace Warm Like Michigan
MINNEAPOLIS — Admitting that this week's extreme wind chills were starting to get to her, Minnesota resident Anne Mauer confirmed Tuesday that she's seriously thinking of packing it all up and moving somewhere warm like Michigan. "The winters here can be so brutal. Maybe it's about time I go someplace down south like Detroit or Kalamazoo," said Mauer, adding that she had even applied to a few jobs in Iowa but worried it'd be too far from her friends and family back home. "I visited my sister in Ohio last Christmas, and the lowest it ever got there was, like, 10 degrees. It was so nice. Supposedly, they only had, like, two and a half feet of snow all winter. That's what I want." At press time, Mauer had given up plans to move and settled instead on a week-long vacation in Rochester.

National Weather Service Stresses Those In Path Of Heat Wave Should Crawl Towards Sparkling, Cold Spring Shimmering At Edge Of Vision
SILVER SPRINGS, MD — Emphasizing the importance of staying cool and hydrated during the record-breaking temperatures, the National Weather Service stressed Thursday that those in the path of the upcoming heat wave should crawl towards the sparkling, cold spring shimmering at the edge of their vision. "Should you, in a moment of thirst, suddenly hear the sound of running water, or spot a picturesque, babbling brook in the distance, we urge you to drop to your knees and pull yourself towards it," said director of the National Weather Service Dr. Louis W. Uccellini, instructing the 70 million Americans affected by extreme heat to be extra vigilant should they see a shaded area, a waterfall, or a group of naked women splashing in the water beckoning them to come swim. "Especially in areas with the highest temperatures, we advise Americans to immediately yell 'thank God' before using their last remaining strength to claw their way towards the oasis. Then, should you ever reach it, don't hesitate to take off your clothes, jump in, and drink the freezing cold water straight from your hands." At press time, the National Weather Service apologized after millions of Americans had injured themselves attempting to dive into the spring, only to smash their heads on a concrete sidewalk.

Puerto Ricans Without Power For Month Can Only Assume This Leading Story Across National News Media
SAN JUAN, PR — Saying that their fellow countrymen were probably deluged with coverage of their plight, residents of Puerto Rico who have been without power for the last month told reporters Thursday that they could only assume that this crisis had to be the nation's leading news story. "I mean, I haven't heard anything due to being without electricity for so long, but I assume this catastrophe is dominating the 24-hour news cycle in the rest of the country," said 46-year-old Mariel Costa, one of 3.4 million Puerto Ricans who felt positive that news sources like The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Fox News, and other media organizations must be unable to cover much of anything else but the ongoing humanitarian crisis happening in the U.S. territory since Hurricane Maria devastated the island five weeks ago. "This many Americans struggling to survive without electricity or clean drinking water for so long; it must be all the rest of the country is talking about. It's probably gut wrenching for them to be confronted by the photos of this tragedy on a daily basis. It really keeps us going knowing that our American brothers and sisters care and are thinking about us constantly." At press time, news outlets were reportedly clamoring to cover the recently released classified files on President John F. Kennedy's assassination more than 50 years ago.

Nation's Math Professors Announce Plans To Continue Wearing Chinos With Running Shoes Indefinitely
QUINCY, MA — Confirming that they have no intention of modifying the traditional uniform of their profession at any point in the foreseeable future, mathematics professors from across the country joined their voices Monday to reaffirm their commitment to wearing chinos with running shoes. "We believe that this singular look has really been working for us for the past few decades, allowing as always for slight variations such as the presence or absence of pleats and the availability of slightly different varieties of white Reebok footwear, and we have decided to formally recommit to this outfit for as long as our profession continues to exist," said Boston University vector analysis professor Paul Slavish, explaining that the pairing of khakis with cross trainers had become the symbol of his profession, as it offered a perfect combination of professionalism, approachability, and the comfort vital for on-campus life. "We acknowledge that our sneakers, while technically advanced, will never be used for actual running; our pants, while relatively clean, will never actually be ironed; and that this lower ensemble will always be paired with either a dress shirt two sizes too large or a sweat-wicking polo shirt that has never — and will never — wick away the sweat of exercise. Never shall we stray from this sacred combination, which proclaims at a glance that we are casual, unfussy people who happen to be very serious about mathematics. Plus, check out all these side pockets!" Slavish also confirmed that certain professors would occasionally wear a wacky necktie printed with mathematical symbols, but that this would occur at a maximum of three days per semester.

Panic Rapidly Setting In As Man Realizes He Has No Plan For Ripe Avocado
BRENTWOOD, TN — Growing increasingly worked up over his lack of foresight, local man Alexander Diggs began to experience severe panic after realizing he had no plans for the ripe avocado on his kitchen counter, sources indicated Friday. "Oh God, no, no, no, please — I just picked this up yesterday, and it's already going soft — what the hell am I supposed to do?" said Diggs, who reportedly was gripped with a sense of terror and uncertainty upon realizing the perishable good would soon expire and he didn't have a single salad, brunch, or dinner recipe in mind. "Think, dammit. Surely, I can put it to some kind of use. Oh, who am I kidding? I don't even have a piece of bread to scrape it on. Why did I buy this thing? Fuck, fuck, fuck!" At press time, reports confirmed Diggs had decided to bury the avocado deep in his kitchen wastebasket beneath a layer of paper towels.

Italian Grandmother Doesn't Have Heart To Tell Family Any Dipshit Can Make Lasagna
EASTON, PA — Dreading the looks on their faces once they realized the recipe was "truly easy as fuck," local grandmother Rosemary Guzzo, 79, confirmed Monday that she didn't have the heart to tell her family that any dipshit can make lasagna. "No, I don't think I can bring myself to do it. They'd be too crushed to find out I learned how to make 'Nana's famous lasagna' from the back of a Barilla box," said Guzzo, explaining that the dish involved not some old-world secret guarded by generations of Italian matriarchs, but the layering of pasta, meat, cheese, and tomato sauce. "You know what's hard to make? Soufflé. Not lasagna. Any knuckle-dragging dumbass off the street can set an oven to 375 and pop in a baking pan." At press time, Guzzo's daughter had asked her to write down each step so they could enjoy the "family treasure" for years to come.

Literary Historians Discover Hemingway's Dad Bulk Purchased 70,000 Copies Of 'The Sun Also Rises' To Get Son On Bestseller List
GAINESVILLE, FL — Shedding new light on the life of the celebrated author, literary historians from the University of Florida announced Tuesday that they had discovered evidence that Ernest Hemingway's father had bulk purchased 70,000 copies of The Sun Also Rises to get his son on the bestseller list. "These findings suggest that this now-classic modernist novel might never have had the same impact if Hemingway's dad, a wealthy physician, hadn't bought up as many copies as possible to artificially inflate sales," said researcher Abigail Gupta, confirming that her team had uncovered a massive warehouse full of unopened first editions that had been rented to Dr. Clarence Hemingway. "We first developed this theory after noticing that book jackets calling The Sun Also Rises a bestseller included a mark indicating suspicious purchasing activity. We believe these actions likely had a huge effect on the reception of the book, allowing the senior Hemingway to essentially purchase prestige in order to buy his son's way into the literary canon." Gupta added that there was also evidence that praise for The Old Man And The Sea was due to Hemingway planting paid reviews in a number of expatriate-friendly media outlets.

Dress That Would Have Forever Altered Course Of Woman's Life Patted, Placed Back On Rack
LOUISVILLE, KY — Smoothing down the garment before carefully placing it back on the rack, local woman Alicia McNaughton chose to pass up on the dress Monday that would have reportedly altered the course of her life forever. "Maybe this one just isn't for me," said McNaughton, abandoning forever the elegantly cut dress, the color and drape and feel of which would have given her the self-assurance to ascend the social hierarchy at work, captivate the eye of a talent agent, and usher her into a brilliant stratum of fame and luxury, which she would navigate with humor and aplomb until a chance meeting aboard the yacht in the Monaco marina when her true soulmate would have swept her off her feet. "It's pretty enough, but a little pricey. I guess don't really need a new dress [to transform life as I know it in ways I couldn't even begin to imagine, becoming so synonymous with my ascendant fame that it becomes known as 'The McNaughton Dress,' imitated but never equalled by women worldwide and eventually rendered in marble by the greatest artist of the age as he weeps while sculpting the statue for my Parisian tomb, where inspired women will lay flowers until the end of time]." McNaughton settled on a $15 cheaper chambray blouse that will be instrumental in her meeting an insurance adjuster she will date on and off for 14 lackluster months.

Director Sadly States Cancel Culture Would Never Let You Make Zapruder Film In Today's Climate
LOS ANGELES — Expressing a longing for past eras that were more tolerant of artistic expression, director Greg Loud sadly reflected Monday that the current climate of cancel culture would likely never let you make the Zapruder film today. "In these highly PC times, there's no way a classic picture like the Zapruder film would ever get off the ground," said Loud, telling reporters that the influential and celebrated 1963 film would almost certainly be decried as offensive and overly violent by today's social justice warriors. "We just live in a day and age where censorship is the norm and everyone is dying to be outraged, so as soon as audiences got one look at John F. Kennedy's head exploding, the blue checkmark Twitter mob would've probably driven Abe Zapruder out of town on a rail." Loud added that the situation was arguably even worse with comedies, reflecting that with current cultural tastes, the video of the Challenger explosion would likely never have even made it past the pitch stage.

NCAA Launches Investigation Into Why It Wasn't Making Millions Off Recent College Admissions Scandal
INDIANAPOLIS, IN — In a stern indictment of the cash-grabbing scandal that the student athletics organization was somehow kept completely in the dark about, the NCAA announced Monday the launch of an investigation into why it wasn't making millions off of the recent college admissions controversy. "After the disturbing revelations that massive bribes were being paid out to people other than us, we're launching an immediate inquiry into how we possibly missed out on this," said NCAA president Mark Emmert, who claimed it was a "total failure of the system" that they were not raking in cash from wealthy celebrities when universities like Stanford, Yale, and USC were. "As an organization that always strives to squeeze money out of college athletics, I'm disgusted that this all went on right under our noses without us getting so much as a taste. There's no way there isn't some desperate millionaire out there willing to pay for his son to be a benchwarmer on a D1 team. To miss out on such a lucrative pay-to-play scheme goes against everything the NCAA stands for." At press time, the NCAA had fined and suspended dozens of college coaches for not letting them in on the action.

Applicant Who Actually Faced Punishment For Sexual Assault Clearly Not Yale Material
NEW HAVEN, CT — Immediately dismissing the high school senior's chances of acceptance after reviewing his record, Yale admissions officers reportedly decided Friday that an applicant who had actually faced punishment for committing sexual assault was clearly not Yale material. "We have a very high standard here at Yale, and it's abundantly clear that any applicant who has received actual consequences for sexual misconduct is just not someone who will thrive here," said Yale admissions officer Paul Shelton, adding that lowering the university's standards to admit the applicant who had been suspended from school and had to perform mandatory community service for sexual abuse was unfair to other applicants who had committed sexual assault and evaded all punishment. "What we look for in an applicant is evidence that he's able to successfully intimidate his victim into silence, convince everyone that his victim is lying, or use his connections and family influence to get the whole episode swept under the rug. This is an elite school whose distinguished alums include President Bill Clinton, President George H.W. Bush, and Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, and we cannot in good conscience accept an applicant such as this young man who perpetrates sexual abuse and is unable to weasel his way out of any and all repercussions." Admissions officers added that while the university is highly selective, they were committed to ensuring that any student who had successfully avoided punishment for sexual assault in high school would receive every opportunity to do the same during his time at Yale.

Roller Coaster Designer's Artistic Vision Sullied By Fantastic Four Tie-In
GURNEE, IL — Insisting that every ounce of integrity had been removed from his creation, roller coaster designer Jonathan Leeman told reporters Friday that Six Flags Great America's egregious incorporation of the Fantastic Four into his ride had completely sullied his artistic vision. "I didn't spend a year crafting each corkscrew, hammerhead turn, and dive loop of this ride to have it tarnished with a blue-and-silver color scheme and cars painted to vaguely resemble Mister Fantastic and Doctor Doom," said Leeman, shaking his head and remarking that, had he known it was going to have a 20-foot-tall number 4 mounted to the side of it, he never would have added a 17-story lift hill. "This ride was supposed to be purely about the thrills, the choreographed push and pull of G-forces, but look at it now: a garish mishmash of steel, comic book art, and speakers that endlessly blare The Thing's awful roar. It's a hideous perversion of what it once stood for." At press time, Leeman was reportedly relieved to learn that his newest idea for an inverted coaster would, in contrast, be subtly complemented and enhanced by several tasteful likenesses of Yosemite Sam.

University Suspends All Lightweights From Campus Following Fraternity Hazing Death
TUSCALOOSA, AL — In an effort to prevent further alcohol-related tragedy, University of Alabama administrators announced plans Tuesday to suspend all lightweights who can't handle their shit following the hazing death of freshman Delta Kappa Epsilon pledge Matthew Young. "What happened to Matt this past weekend is entirely preventable, which is why we are immediately restricting all pipsqueaks who can't even butt-chug a measly fucking 40 of Old English to their housing units," an email from University of Alabama president Stuart R. Bell read in part, also announcing that all 798 pathetic little bitches pledged to the school's 15 weak-ass fraternities were disenrolled from their fall courses effective immediately. "Greek life has always been an important part of tradition on our campus, and we hope it will remain so, but students need to be aware that they will not have a place in this institution until they can drink a double pint of semen-laced vodka, run five miles in the nude while shotgunning a 12-pack of beer, and find their way home blindfolded without passing out. The University of Alabama simply does not tolerate pussies who go crying to mommy simply because they never learned to go hard in the motherfucking paint. That behavior has no place at this university." Bell acknowledged that this measure is not enough on its own, and that everyone at both the university and the country at large needs to do a better job combatting the rampant lightweight culture that contributed to Young's death.

Supposedly Educated Professor Has No Idea How To Get Bird Out Of Lecture Hall
KALAMAZOO, MI — Failing to complete the simple task despite his ostensibly robust academic background, onlooking students at Kalamazoo College reported Wednesday that their supposedly educated literature professor Gene Cabella demonstrated no clue as to how to rid their lecture hall of a bird that had flown in through an open window. "He was talking a pretty big game about his intensive syllabus, then the bird came in and he completely panicked. Guess you didn't get your PhD in birds, huh, Professor?" said sophomore Ken Pei, chuckling to himself as he sat back and watched his so-called academic superior frantically wave a manilla folder in the general direction of the bird, jump backwards when it flapped its wings in his direction, then spend the next few minutes attempting to ignore the creature's loud chirps as if the entire class hadn't just watched him desperately try to scare it away. "You're the one in charge here, bucko. Sorry they didn't teach you this at Yale — do they not have birds there? Well, guess what, you're at Kalamazoo now, fucker, so you're gonna have to learn to deal." At press time, Professor Cabella's credibility had reportedly taken an "absolute nosedive" after he paused the lecture once more to place a panicky, stuttering phone call to the campus maintenance department asking for assistance.

Disappointing Buffalo Wild Wings Not Living Up To Ridicule
LOS ANGELES — Describing the experience as a significant letdown, local diner Eric Tidwell told reporters that the disappointing Buffalo Wild Wings franchise he visited Thursday night failed to live up to the scorn he had long heard about the restaurant. "Sure, it was pretty bad and everything, but not nearly as horrible as I expected," said the 32-year-old marketing manager, adding that the wings he ordered were only marginally worse than those served at most bars, and that the waitstaff wasn't nearly as slow or inattentive as anticipated. "Everyone's always talking about how much this place sucks — and it does — but it isn't blow-you-away bad, you know? When I walked in here, I was expecting everything to be completely appalling, but even the atmosphere in this place is borderline tolerable. Overall, I thought it would be way shittier." At press time, Tidwell admitted he was beginning to change his mind about the Buffalo Wild Wings as he felt the first sharp pains of a stomach ache.

Man Regrets Wasting Money On College After Failing To Secure Perfect Dream Life By 24
NEW YORK — Noting that his four years at Fordham University hadn't even led to a 3,000-square-foot penthouse apartment on the Upper East Side yet, local 24-year-old Alex Michaelson, who still hasn't achieved his dream life, told reporters Tuesday he regrets wasting money on a college education. "What's the point of going $30,000 in debt if my starting annual salary out of college is only going to be $60,000 per year?" said Michaelson, who, despite aspiring to be a high-powered CEO, simply has a steady position as an operations manager at a successful Midtown real estate firm. "I studied my ass off majoring in computer science and I've been in the workforce for 18 months, but here I am now, a 24-year-old without a beautiful family, a second home, multiple sports cars, or an issue of GQ with my face on the cover. The whole thing's such a racket." Michaelson added that all he had to show for his education was a worthless piece of paper and a luxurious studio apartment in the East Village.

Smithsonian Acquires Rare Photograph Where Whole Family Looks Really Nice
WASHINGTON — Calling the image an important addition to their collection, officials from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History announced Friday they have acquired a rare photograph where the whole Barlow family looks very nice. "The Smithsonian is proud to celebrate this exceptional and iconic 2014 vacation snapshot of the Barlow family in which Matthew, Karen, Joanna, and Bradley all have genuine smiles and no one is squinting or blinking," said head researcher Rodney Agee, adding that for the first time in American history, the extraordinary photograph perfectly captured the Barlows appearing well-groomed and happy to be in each other's company. "This magnificent informal group portrait is a national treasure, as all members of the Barlow family are dressed in nice, clean outfits free of wrinkles and stains, evenly lit, and looking in the right direction." At press time, a Smithsonian spokesperson told reporters the photo was the only known image of Bradley on his best behavior and not fucking around.

Xi Jinping Vows To Combat Coronavirus By Making It Illegal To Mention Within A Week
BEIJING — In an effort to assuage concerns about how his government has handled the deadly disease outbreak, Chinese president Xi Jinping held a press conference Monday to announce plans to combat the coronavirus by making it illegal to mention within the next week. "We are directing massive resources towards eradicating the slightest hint of any person speaking about the virus, and I promise you that any conversation or literature pertaining to the virus will be completely eliminated during the next seven days," said Xi, warning that if immediate action was not taken, it could be too late to stop the spread of information. "We have already seen far too many senseless deaths as a result of this outbreak, so I vow here and now that those official death toll numbers will remain unchanged." Xi closed his remarks by urging anyone who believed they were suffering from the outbreak or knew someone who was to come forward so they could be executed.

Mental Health Experts Say Friends Giving Away Possessions Could Be Warning Sign They Planning On Moving
BOSTON — In an effort to educate Americans on the common warning signs, mental health experts at Boston University issued a report Thursday noting that friends giving away their possessions was often a red flag that they're planning on moving. "If you have a friend who has attempted to pass off objects like a bulky bookshelf or rickety night stand, it could suggest that the person may be headed in the direction of signing a new lease," said lead researcher Sandra Maiworm, urging Americans to keep an eye out for loved ones suddenly trying to part with their coffee maker or blender, or making seemingly innocuous comments about being unable to attend any block parties after the end of the month. "Once a person reaches the stage where they're giving away personal items, it suggests that they're pretty far along in the process. They've probably been feeling for months like they just can't take their landlord anymore, and it's distinctly possible that they have already researched online about the most painless and effective ways to hire movers. Please, talk to them and find out what's going on in their life so you don't knock on the door of their apartment one day and find out they're already gone." Maiworm added that direct communication was key despite many people's reluctance to broach the subject out of fear that it might lead their friend to ask for help moving their couch.

Man Not Sure If Friend's House The Type Where He Supposed To Take Off Clothes Before Entering
MONTCLAIR, NJ — Emphasizing that the last thing he wanted to do was offend someone in their own home, local man Tyler Fredriksson told reporters Wednesday that he wasn't sure if his friend's house was the type where he was supposed to take off his clothes before entering. "Growing up, my family kept our shirts, pants, and underwear on inside, but everyone is different," said Fredriksson, taking a moment to survey the sweaters strewn all over the foyer before attempting to peek into the kitchen to see if his friend was completely naked or not. "I mean, his place does look super clean, and I'd hate to track stuff over this brand new white carpet with my dirty clothes. Maybe I should strip down to my socks, just to be polite." At press time, a fully nude Fredriksson had apologized after being informed that the white slippers at the doorstep were intended for him to wear inside the house.

Neighbor Oblivious To Fact She Being Groomed For Cat-Sitting
CHICAGO — As she fielded seemingly innocuous questions about her work schedule and childhood history with pets, local woman Daphne Horschel appeared oblivious to the fact that her neighbor, Brooks Tiller, was carefully grooming her for cat-sitting, apartment sources confirmed Monday. "You work from home, right? It must be nice having that flexibility," Tiller said to Horschel, who reportedly had no idea their polite banter and a recent invitation to a dinner party were all steps in a clandestine vetting procedure being carried out to determine if she would be a willing and reliable cat-sitter. "Uh-oh, look who came out to say hello. Snuggles is usually pretty shy, so he must really like you!" At press time, reports indicated Horschel had thanked Tiller for a plate of baked goods that were part of an elaborate stratagem designed to build just enough goodwill so that she would feel obligated to take care of his cat next weekend.

Man Starting To Think Only Reason People Hanging Out With Him Because They All On Same Jury
AUSTIN, TX — Expressing his concern that the relationships may be based on obligation rather than real friendship, local man Alec Crawford told reporters Tuesday that he was beginning to think that the only reason people were hanging out with him was because they were all on the same jury. "Sure, we all get lunch together and we've been pretty much inseparable for the last couple weeks, but there's some part of me that can't help but feel they're only putting up with me because they're legally required to do so," said Crawford, admitting that he couldn't quite shake the sense that they never would have met up at that bar the night before if they weren't all sequestered in the same hotel for the duration of the trial. "Everybody has been cool, but there have been little tip-offs here and there that they might be more interested in their civic duty than nurturing the special bond we've formed. For example, a lot of them still refer to me as 'Juror 4,' and while they're always happy to talk about what we might be getting for dinner that evening, as soon as I start trying to make plans for a weekend trip after the trial ends, everyone's suddenly super vague and non-committal." Crawford also noted that he had no reservations about his blossoming friendship with the defense attorney who had eagerly engaged him in numerous late-night conversations about how his client was innocent.

Tumor-Covered Chester Cheetah Apologizes For Role In Marketing Dangerously Cheesy Cheetos To Children
WASHINGTON — Speaking out against his former employer while testifying before Congress, terminally ill snack-food mascot Chester Cheetah apologized through tumor-riddled lips Friday for his role in marketing dangerously cheesy Cheetos to children. "I'm ashamed to have been a part of this campaign," said Cheetah, who described his struggles from daily exposure to the dangerously cheesy snack, which destroyed his health, caused his fur to slough off in clouds of bright orange dust, and potentially played a role in his wife's miscarriage. "For far too long, I've been complicit in covering up just how much damage these snacks have caused — especially for young children. I'm sure they all watched me skateboarding in my stylish sunglasses and envied the Flamin' Hot lifestyle I lived on my TV show and in Sega Genesis games, but in reality, I was suffering, barely clinging onto life. I can't take back the harm my actions have caused to the world's children, but I promise them this: The harder Frito-Lay tries to sweep my condition under the rug, the harder I will fight. I refuse to be silenced." Cheetah's statement is the most severe mascot-related scandal to hit Frito-Lay since 1972, when the Frito Bandito was gunned down by treasury agents outside an El Paso currency exchange.

Nation's Idiots Announce Plans To Jump Off Their Roofs Into A Pile Of Snow And Break Their Fucking Legs
CARBONDALE, IL — Stating their dumbass intentions to get a running start and scream "cowabunga," the nation's idiots announced plans Monday to jump off their roofs into a pile of snow and break their fucking legs. "We dunces stand on our roof gutters today, fully prepared to jump 20 feet to the ground and straight into a mountain of powder that we assume will break our fall, but almost certainly will cause our bones to crack," said 29-year-old dipshit Lyle Bennett, one of thousands of morons nationwide who will snap their limbs in motherfucking half after trying out a backflip, slipping on a roof tile, or doing a pencil dive and holding their nose as if going into a pool. "We will, of course, ask our idiot friend if he's filming yet before we plunge down and shatter our arms, legs, and necks in one fell swoop. Consequently, you should expect us to repeatedly show our broken bones to the camera, flailing them around and freaking everyone the fuck out." The nation's buddies added that they promise to put the whole thing on YouTube, including the part where they simultaneously yell out "Are you okay, dude?"

Man Wearing Cobra Command Shirt Missed The Whole Point Of 'G.I. Joe'
SUMTER, SC — Saying that he clearly learned all the wrong lessons from the classic animated programs, several people witnessing their coworker Aaron Rowe wearing a Cobra Command T-shirt Tuesday confirmed that he missed the whole point of G.I. Joe. "Dude, that's not what the show's about at all. It's like he didn't pay attention to a single episode," said sales associate Paolo Yates, expressing feelings of disappointment at his officemate for supporting a group whose sole objective was to "sow mayhem and destruction." "This is just a slap in the face to our greatest Real American Heroes. Cobra was clearly a team of bad guys, even if they sometimes pretended to be peaceful in order to dupe the Joes. For Aaron to proudly display that hateful iconography on his shirt and present it as some sort of moral symbol is just flat-out wrong, and I'm a little freaked out that he even knew where to buy something like that." At press time, Rowe had been admonished by his employer, who claimed "such divisive and transgressive iconography does not represent the values of Davis and Lee's Proud Rebel Confederated Plumbing Supply, Inc."

Man At Park Who Set Up Table Full Of Water Cups Has No Idea How Passing Marathon Runners Got Impression They Can Take Them
CHICAGO — Expressing his incredulity at the race participants' level of entitlement, a local man who set up a table full of water cups at Grant Park told reporters Sunday he had no idea how passing marathon runners got the impression they could just take them. "I came here like I do every weekend to enjoy a leisurely afternoon of sipping water from dozens of small cups, and all of a sudden these jerks in spandex start dashing through and stealing them," said Evan Burdette, who confirmed that he didn't go through the effort of erecting a folding table under his favorite tree and filling 30 or 40 Dixie cups from a nearby water fountain only to have them snatched away by a bunch of strangers. "This is my favorite part of the week, a special little treat just for me, and they're ruining the whole thing. I tried chasing after one of them, but he was going too fast, and then when I got back to my table, some other assholes had grabbed even more cups and crumpled them on the ground. They've been at it for the last hour and a half — who do these people think they are?" At press time, Burdette was reportedly outraged after another group of runners pilfered several pieces of his personal supply of nipple tape.

Cat Treat Package Going On About Delicious, Creamy Center Too Much Not To Be Marketing To Humans
OCEAN CITY, MD — Stressing that the descriptions sounded incredibly tasty, local man Lucas Petrakis told reporters Monday that the copy on a package of cat treats was going on about their delicious, creamy center way too much for the company not to be marketing the product to humans. "It says they are 'slow-roasted' and 'savory,' which, come on, it definitely sounds like something you'd see on a normal snack," said Petrakis of the product, which happens to be perfectly bite-sized for a human mouth, explaining how the packaging even contains a cross-section photograph of one of the glistening treats that the text describes as "a soft and meaty center." "It also says they have a crunchy outside and an 'irresistible filling,' and it's kind of making me crave them when I shouldn't be. They really make them out to be quite appetizing in the text — I mean, the brand is even called 'Temptations' — which is a little suspect since it's not like my cat is going to be reading this." At press time, Petrakis said, "Fuck it" and popped a handful of the cat treats in his mouth.

MANISTIQUE, MI — Saying it was hard to imagine her Christmastime treats without the ingredient, area woman Geena Wolferman confirmed Monday that 92 percent of her holiday recipes involved pulverizing a bag of Oreos. "My go-to dessert is this chocolate pudding pie with an Oreo crust that absolutely everyone loves," said Wolferman, describing just one of the ways in which an entire 14-ounce bag of the sandwich cookies is smashed into tiny chips and then incorporated into 9 out of 10 of the dishes she prepares for the holidays. "Another favorite of mine is taking two bags of crushed Oreos, rolling them into little balls, and then dipping them into melted chocolate. Sometimes I also throw a handful of those on top of this special cookies-and-cream ice cream cake I make by folding Oreo crumbles into vanilla ice cream and layering it with rows of Oreo pieces." At press time, Wolferman was pounding furiously on a bag of Oreos to place in a bowl just in case someone wanted to add some extra crumbs.

"I noticed it a few centuries ago and no matter what I try, it just keeps getting worse," said the serpentine creature, adding that the ingrown head was most likely caused by it growing back incorrectly after being sliced off by a hero at the wrong angle. "It's all swollen, and it's just gross to look at. I tried treating it with antibiotic cream and a bandage, but I think it's time to have professional examine it before it gets way worse." At press time, a doctor had successfully removed the ingrown head, but two more ingrown heads reportedly immediately appeared in its place.

Oh Great, Another Woman Who Only Loves Me For My Complete Collection Of 'Rurouni Kenshin' Manga
Well isn't that great — just great. Here I am, thinking I've finally met someone who's perfect for me — she's caring, smart, beautiful, and most of all, it seemed like she really got me. But I should have known better. Turns out she's just like the rest of them, just another in a long line of women who only love me for my complete collection of the classic wandering samurai manga Rurouni Kenshin. How could I be so stupid to think that a girl would actually like me for who I am, instead of my admittedly comprehensive library of the manga series about a swordsman embarking on a journey of redemption through Meiji-era Japan in atonement for his former life as a vicious Tokugawa government assassin? God, I'm getting so sick and tired of this happening all the time. I should have seen it coming a mile away. I really should have. But when you think you've finally found "the one," you don't notice the warning signs. You just think it's cute and innocent when she subtly prods you to find out precisely how big your collection of the seminal Nobuhiro Watsuki series is: Do I really have all 28 tankōbon of the manga, stretching all the way to the conclusive Jinchū Arc? Do I have a lot of doubles? What about the chapter "The Great Man Vs. The Giant," where Kenshin fights off the massive warrior Fuji with only his signature reverse katana? Do I have that? In hindsight, it's all so obvious what she was really after all along. Come on, Roger, you dumb sucker. When are you going to get it through your head? I'm frankly embarrassed to think of all the time I wasted trying to build a genuine connection with someone only to discover she was just trying to get to my full set of the epic saga of a formerly brutal warrior from the Bakumatsu and his ragtag crew of peaceful sidekicks. Honestly, I should have learned my lesson when I fell so hard for Amanda a few years back. Date after date, I overlooked all the red flags, falling deeper in love as I ignored the dozens of times she would bring up the mankiller Hitokiri Battosai, baiting me into talking about how extensive and like new my collection was. And every time we ended up at my place, sure, she would pay attention to me for a few moments, but then she'd make a beeline right to my 28-volume set and start counting them. "I love you, Roger," she would say, a gleam in her eye, but only after she began flipping through page after page of "Mitsurugi, Master And Student," "Overture To Destruction," or any of the other vividly illustrated installments of one of Shueisha's most critically acclaimed manga series of all time. I guess I was so blinded by my own feelings that I couldn't see the writing on the wall. Everything she did makes perfect sense now: why she never wanted to hang out at her apartment; why she wanted to stay in most nights; why more and more frequently, I would catch her staring lustily at the plush toy of beautiful martial arts instructor Kamiya Kaoru or the 18-inch figurine of scrappy sword-for-hire Sagara Sanosuke, keeping watch from the bookshelf where I kept my voluminous, perfectly curated set. But look, I'm not totally naive. Do I understand why these women are drawn to me for my 255-chapter series? Of course. We're talking about one of the most influential works in the shōnen genre of young adult comics, one that captivated audiences in Japan for years during its half-decade run in Weekly Shōnen Jump. Honestly, how many women out there could hear mention of such an exhaustive selection of Viz Media comics and not be at least a little bit interested? But even back years ago, when I would get girls to fawn over me at the bar by flashing my copy of the rare Kenshin short story "Cherry Blossoms In The Spring," I've always known in my heart of hearts that it would never get me any closer to the sort of real love I've always wanted. For God's sake, there's so much more to me than just a shelf of classic manga for women to thumb through! I'm a human being with feelings, one who just wants to meet someone who can look past my dozens of impressive mint-condition comics, official soundtracks, framed cel art of Yahiko and Saitō, and Rurouni Kenshin–themed apparel, keychains, and sweatbands scattered around my apartment, and see me for who I really am. Because the fact is, I have a lot to offer beyond my Kenshin collection. For example, most women don't even care that I own the DVD box sets of both the action-adventure anime series Fullmetal Alchemist and its sequel, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. If I ever found a woman who liked me for that, I'd never let her go. Roger Hendrix

Impatient Raytheon Declares War On North Korea
WALTHAM, MA — Saying that if the U.S. government would not act it was time to take matters into their own hands, defense contractor Raytheon declared war on North Korea, sources confirmed Friday. "Look, the American government has made it abundantly clear with their massive payments and subsidies to the private defense sector that they want to scale up military action on the Korean peninsula, but if they're going to putter around with peace summits, then it's clearly up to Raytheon to lead the charge," said Raytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy as platoons of Raytheon employees boarded company aircraft armed with its AGM-65 Maverick and High Speed Anti-Radiation missiles, noting that fleets of Raytheon ships carrying private security forces were already speeding across the Pacific toward the North Korean theater. "For too long, we have put off what would be an excellent use of our armaments. We can only stockpile weapons for so much time before we have to use them, and frankly, we're tired of the empty promises from multiple presidential administrations that we're going to get to unleash our full arsenal on North Korea. If the government can't even declare a simple war, it's clearly time for the private sector to step in. Let's get this show on the goddamn road." At press time, Raytheon allies Booz Allen Hamilton, Halliburton, and the United Kingdom had announced that they would be sending weapons and ground troops to support Raytheon's invasion of North Korea.

Report: 80% Of Women Currently Wearing Wrong Size Bra, Shirt, Shoes, Pants, Hat
STANFORD, CA — Apparel and textile researchers at Stanford University reported Thursday that, after 18 months of comparing garment and accessory sizes to the wearer's actual measurements, 80 percent of American women are currently wearing the wrong size bras, shirts, shoes, pants, and hats. "Once we took accurate body measurements and cross-referenced them with items of clothing instead of, say, allowing women to hold garments up against themselves while looking in the mirror, we discovered that four out of five have it completely wrong," said lead researcher Gloria Denton concerning the report, which also found that the 20 percent of women who managed to find a pair of decent-fitting shoes or a hat that didn't drop over their eyes were still wearing pants or tops that were either too tight, too loose, the wrong length, or simply draped poorly over their bodies. "In extreme cases, we discovered women shopping online will repeatedly use the wrong sock, belt, glove, and even ring size to purchase clothing. Moreover, collected data demonstrate that a full 100 percent of all women were wearing bras with incorrect measurements in every aspect of band width, strap length, and cup size, although we concluded you can't really blame them for that. It's almost worse than buying decent jeans — I mean, jeans? Fuck me." The report linked findings to a variety of factors, notably "vanity sizes" and brand disparities among clothing manufacturers, but maintained that the root cause of the issue was in there being absolutely no reference for accuracy as no woman on record has ever worn a complete ensemble that all fit.

Samin Nosrat Releases Updated Book 'Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, Marshmallow' About The 5 Key Elements Of Good Cooking
BERKELEY, CA — In an effort to continue breaking down the basic fundamentals of her craft, chef Samin Nosrat published her bestselling cookbook in a revised edition Friday that now covers five key elements of good cooking and is titled Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, Marshmallow. "Look in the pantry of any professional chef, and you can bet you'll find cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil, Maldon sea salt, and a big tub of Jet-Puffed marshmallows," said Nosrat, who remarked that when she's enjoying a restaurant dish and wonders what amazing flavor is making it taste so good, nine times out of 10 it turns out to be the marshmallow. "I find that you can really elevate a normal meal to sublime heights by drizzling melted marshmallow over the top of a pan-roasted chicken or finishing off a beautifully seared ribeye with a thick basting of marshmallow. It also makes the perfect addition to s'mores and ambrosia." Nosrat added that regardless of whether you opt for regular, chocolate-stuffed, or rainbow, it's essential not to skimp and to use only the highest quality artisanal marshmallows you can find.

'Those Have To Be First-Time Parents,' Onlooker Says Of Couple Trying To Screw Infant Into Light Bulb Socket
YARMOUTH, MA — Shaking their heads in dismay at the clueless couple's child-rearing difficulties, onlookers speculated Thursday that a husband and wife trying to screw their infant son into a light bulb socket must be first-time parents. "Boy, I know there's a learning curve for raising a kid, but it doesn't make it any easier to see first-time parents struggling with the basics like this," said onlooker Jeffrey Garrett, cringing as he watched the wide-eyed, panicking husband strain to push his newborn's head into the open socket before waving away his wife's suggestion that they just try plugging the girl into a wall outlet. "I don't want to be the jerk that goes over there and tells them they're doing it all wrong, but man, oh man, this is just such a classic mistake. I knew from the second I walked up and saw them swaddling that little guy in an electrical cord that they were way out of their depths." At press time, onlookers were nodding in approval after the parents had learned from their mistakes and soothed the squirming infant by giving her a spark plug to suckle.

10 Mistakes New Parents Always Make
When drawing a bath for a young child, many parents make it too hot. Be sure to test the temperature of the water by placing another family's infant in it first. At bedtime, parents often neglect to properly wrap up their newborn infant in enough aluminum foil. If you're a new parent who is always feeding your child crumpled-up balls of wet paper, don't worry — you're certainly not alone! Next time, though, try breast milk, formula, or pureed foods. You know you're driving behind a new parent when you see an infant crawling around the bed of a pickup truck. During those crucial first few months, it's important for parents not to lose sight of their baby even for a second. Many a new mother and father has left the room for only a couple minutes and returned to find their child replaced by ubiquitous character actor James Cromwell. Don't make this common parenting misstep: forgetting to remind your daughter that you are her father now, that she's going to start a new life living with you because you love her very much, and that she won't see her old mommy and daddy again. Perhaps because of the adverse response it elicits from the child, many parents assume their infant is allergic to air horns. But don't run to the emergency room, because it's impossible for someone to be allergic to a sound. It's important to keep looking for the actual cause of the allergy. While many believe such behavior will not have long-term negative consequences for their child, research says it can be very disruptive to development when parents frequently fight crime in front of their newborn child. Many new Andromedan parents try to teach their children a second language after Talimian. Unless Semil or Niburan is already spoken in the house, this will often stunt a young Andromedan's communication skills and should be left to the appointed teaching faction. Quite often new mothers and fathers will screw up by looking for parenting advice from a fucking slideshow.

Treble Clef Honored With Lifetime Achievement Award During 62nd Annual Grammy Ceremony
LOS ANGELES — Entering the stage of the Staples Center to raucous applause and a standing ovation, the Treble Clef was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award during the 62nd annual Grammy Awards on Sunday night. "It is a great honor for me to be bestowing this award to one of the greatest living musical symbols of our era," said presenter John Legend in a long, emotional speech, as a photo montage played in the background depicting the major moments in the Treble Clef's career, which included collaborating with Louis Armstrong at the Cotton Club, The Beatles during their final rooftop concert, as well as Michael Jackson's Thriller studio sessions. "This award is long overdue. From its contributions to Indian classical music, to Gregorian chant, to modern-day hip-hop, it's difficult to overstate the seminal contributions the Treble Clef has made to our art form." At press time, the Treble Clef began taking part in a special Grammy's performance with Lil Nas X, Lana Del Rey, and Ed Sheeran.

Hot New 'Murder Craze' Sweeps Chicago
CHICAGO — According to the nation's tastemakers and trendsetters, the city of Chicago is currently wrapped up in a hot new murder craze, with murders occurring almost every day of the week, and sometimes happening well into the night. "Englewood, Roseland, and Lawndale are some of the trendiest murder spots in the Windy City, with double or even triple homicides taking place on some of the hippest street corners and housing projects," said trend expert Alyssa Mayrose, adding that while urban youths are at the cutting edge of the citywide craze, everyone, including middle-aged men and women, are getting caught up in Chicago's "murder mania." "Some of the über-hip, very exclusive murders are happening in little tucked away places, like in the back alley of Lloyd's Lounge in Riverdale. But if you are out on the town and want to find a murder, believe me, you don't have to look that hard. Bottom line: If you've got a gun or a knife and you want to kill someone, Chicago is the place to be right now." Mayrose added that with the Chicago Police Department in complete and utter disarray, there is no indication that the cool, happening new trend of murdering people will end anytime soon.

Dumb Tourists In Paris Gawking At Splendor Of Greatest Architectural Feats In Human History
PARIS — Stopping every few blocks to tilt back their heads in wonder, idiotic hick tourists on their first visit to Paris made utter fools of themselves this week by unabashedly gawking at the timeless splendor of some of the most beautiful examples of architecture in human history. "Check out these dopes goggling at this breathtaking testament to the melding of engineering and human creativity," said Eiffel Tower tour guide Henri Bergeron, disdainfully pointing out a large group of vacationers clearly dumbstruck by the zenith of mankind's structural accomplishments. "Oh, what, they've never seen a heart-stopping tribute to humanity's potential before? Year after year, these vulgarians come to Paris to clog our streets, mangle our language, take up too much space in cafés, and openly marvel at the stunning achievements of the human mind and spirit. Typical Americans." Bergeron added that he doesn't come to their small towns and gawk at their stupid triplexes.

Lost Jack London Manuscript, 'The Doggy,' Found
RYE, NY — Workers inventorying the estate of a recently deceased Westchester County art dealer earlier this month reportedly stumbled upon a draft of a previously unknown Jack London novel titled The Doggy, and the work is already being hailed by many within the literary world as a masterpiece. "The Doggy is a gripping tale of a playful 3-year-old yellow Labrador retriever in the Yukon and shows London, the master of vivid naturalist prose, at the height of his literary powers," said Columbia University professor Andrew Spellman of the longhand manuscript that is believed to have been penned in 1908 and chronicles the everyday life of a dog named Cody as he gnaws on fur-lined boots, scampers after tennis balls, and gives big, wet, sloppy kisses. "Indeed, one cannot read The Doggy without feeling the author's intensity for the subject, from the untamed ferocity of Cody's howls when he hears the doorbell ring, to the raw yearning seen in the doggy's eyes when he wants his big old tummy rubbed." According to Spellman, this is the most significant discovery in American literature since a copy of Robert Frost's unpublished poem "Brrrrrr, It's Cold" turned up in 2003.

Busch Gardens Unveils New 9,600-Mile-Long Endurance Coaster
TAMPA, FL — Marking a bold new direction in amusement ride innovation, representatives from Busch Gardens officially opened a 9,600-mile-long mega-coaster Thursday designed to push the limits of human endurance. According to park officials, the Staminator, the world's first transcontinental steel roller coaster, features an intense, 14-day ride that challenges passengers' physical and mental resilience with elements such as a 1,500-mile straightaway, a banked curve across five Midwestern states, and interlocking corkscrews stretching from Nebraska to the West Coast. "There have always been plenty of options at Busch Gardens for the casual thrill-seeker, but never any for those who want an extreme, adrenaline-fueled experience that, over the course of half a month, taxes every fiber of the human spirit while also showing all that this beautiful country has to offer," said park director William Bohl, revealing that the Staminator shatters all previous park records with speeds of 90 mph sustained for 17 hours at a time. "For those people, I present a daring new ride that rockets passengers across vast prairies, through dense forests, over rugged mountain ranges, and down into deep river valleys, as well as blasting them through picturesque historic districts of major metropolitan areas at breakneck speeds." "Busch Gardens is proud to be the only park in the United States committed to thrilling visitors in four different time zones on a single ride," he continued. Bohl confirmed that the cutting-edge ride begins at Busch Gardens' Tampa, FL location and then immediately exits the theme park, quickly disappearing into the horizon and accelerating up the Eastern Seaboard, where passengers encounter a sharp turn from Virginia to Illinois followed by a barrage of 5,000 vertical loops in a row. Additionally, the Staminator reportedly plunges riders into winding, pitch-black underground tunnels for two straight days, returning to the surface for a 10-hour ascent to the peak of Mount Elbert in Colorado before forcing passengers to endure a precipitous 1,400-story drop. According to a warning sign posted for the ride, passengers are recommended to empty their pockets before the ride begins and securely strap nonperishable foods and important medications to their body. The sign also reportedly advises riders to prepare for a wide variety of weather during the ride, with temperatures ranging from 120 degrees in Death Valley to 20 degrees below zero during a 400-mile stretch in the Rocky Mountains that is above the tree line. "I'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie, so when I heard about a ride where you stay upside down across all of the Pacific Northwest, I had to check it out," said passenger Ronnie Grubert, whose face was dirty and heavily bearded after taking the inaugural ride on the Staminator. "I loved all of it, although I must have passed out from either altitude sickness or dehydration when we did an inclined dive loop from Phoenix to Houston." "It was pretty crazy," Grubert added. "I think I lost my right flip-flop over one of the Great Plains states." Busch Gardens officials told reporters that, after exiting the endurance coaster upon its return to the park, passengers would have the opportunity to remember their experience by purchasing a photo of themselves taken just as the coaster crested the Continental Divide on day nine of the ride. "I have to admit that I closed my eyes for the first few states and I didn't really like getting wet when we dipped underwater for the entire length of Lake Tahoe, but overall, I thought it was incredible," said passenger Andrew Hoppe. "Honestly, the whole thing went by really fast, so I'd love to go again. It sucks that you have to wait in line for 90 minutes to get back on, though." "This time, I'll definitely be going to the bathroom beforehand," Hoppe added. Busch Gardens officials also unveiled the Staminator Junior, a modest-paced children's ride on a quarter-mile track that goes in circles 15,000 times.

This Roller Coaster Fails To Capture The Spirit Of My Heroic Adventures
To say I was flattered when I heard Six Flags was interested in developing a thrill ride bearing my name is an understatement. I was quite frankly honored, and even excited, that someone would choose to tell my story in roller-coaster form. I just thought, "What a cool thing," you know? It was a real feather in my cap, and a real treat. But I have to say, when I finally saw my namesake ride, my enthusiasm quickly turned to disappointment. The Green Lantern roller coaster may be fun for the casual amusement-park patron, sure, but it is a complete and utter failure when it comes to telling the tale of my heroic exploits. I, who saved the universe from the Sinestro Corps when they spilled forth from Qward to instill fear in all whom they encountered, no longer feel honored. Now I merely feel like a guy whose name has been cheaply plastered all over a poorly planned, woefully unrepresentative green roller coaster. First of all, the ride is over in 150 seconds. That's not even the length of time it takes to tell the story of a single one of my battles with Solomon Grundy, let alone the decades of daring feats I, and those others who have worn the power ring, have undertaken. I'm not asking for some sort of all-day epic here. It's a roller coaster. They go fast. I get it. But would lengthening the ride so passengers could at least gain a cursory knowledge of the power ring's origins or the Guardians of the Universe really be too much to ask? But let's get to the actual content of the ride. It is essentially a series of corkscrews, loops, and drops on a green track surrounded by absolutely no accompanying scenery, animatronic characters, textual support, or — aside from a low-quality and largely obligatory audio clip of the Green Lantern oath that plays in the first few seconds — story exposition. Take out that sound bite and replace the sign out front and what do you got? A big spiraling piece of metal, folks. Nothing more, nothing less. And why exactly is riding around in loops and corkscrews the primary focus of a Green Lantern ride at all? I don't think I'll be blowing a lot of minds here when I say that I don't exactly do a lot of looping and corkscrewing in my day-to-day life. In fact, I never do those things. And if I did, I certainly would not do them while standing vertically in a car. I can fly, you know. You'd think that, with a little bit of effort, Six Flags could one day build a roller coaster ride that actually tries to simulate the act of flying. Oh, that's right — they already have. It's called Superman: Ultimate Flight, and it's at Six Flags Great America. Unbelievable. I won't even get into how my roller coaster's tagline, "Stand Up to Your Fear," is something I have never said, and seems to exist solely as a reference to the fact that this is a stand-up roller coaster. Now, I suppose one could, if one were being exceedingly generous, make an argument that the 15-story ascent and drop at the beginning could parallel my origins, when I was a fighter pilot and happened upon the crashed spaceship of the dying alien Abin Sur, who gave me my power ring. But at 63 miles per hour, it hardly approximates the speeds I achieved in a jet, let alone the speeds I now reach flying through the depths of space to visit Oa, the home of the Green Lantern Corps. And, again, absolutely no backstory is provided at any point during the ride, so let's just get real here and admit that none of this has anything to do with me or my adventures. It's just a drop. They wanted to build a roller coaster with a drop. Whoop-dee-do. Mission accomplished. And while we're talking about backstory, where were the other Green Lanterns? Where were Guy Gardner, John Stewart, and Kyle Rayner? Not even a nod to Alan Scott, the Golden Age Green Lantern? I'm sorry, but that's a slap in the face of the Green Lantern legacy. Dishonor me if you must, but at least throw a bone to those guys, for God's sake. It's as if the people who run Six Flags never even researched my exploits before affixing my name to the coaster. In fact, I bet park-goers probably walk out of the Green Lantern ride knowing less about me than they did going in. If you're going to put a person's name on something, then make it at least somewhat representative of that individual. As it is currently constructed — and I would be shocked if they didn't come to their senses and make some major changes very soon — the Green Lantern ride could pretty much be "about" anyone or anything. With a few tiny alterations, it could be the Green Arrow ride. Or the Green Hornet ride. Or the fucking Jolly Green Giant Ride. Or just Green: The Ride. That's right. A roller coaster all about the thrilling adventures and captivating saga of the color green. How's that sound, everybody? Now, if the people at Six Flags would like to sit down and talk about how to make this ride truer to my story, then we can do that. I still think a Green Lantern ride is very interesting in theory, I have a lot of ideas, and I work well in groups. So if there's any interest in that, I am more than willing to sit down at a table and hash it out. Otherwise, I have to say, agreeing to license my name and likeness to Six Flags is starting to look like a seriously bad move on my part. Green Lantern

Concerned Nation Gently Encourages Boston To Take It Easy This St. Patrick's Day
BOSTON — Expressing concern for the well-being of the greater metropolitan area in light of their long history of irresponsible behavior, the populace of the United States gently suggested to Boston Thursday that perhaps they should take it easy this St. Patrick's Day. "We want you guys to have fun and celebrate, but don't go completely overboard this year, all right?" said the apprehensive U.S. populace, reminding the nation's most outspoken bastion of both real and imagined Irish-American culture that they could celebrate the holiday without binge drinking, bare-knuckle boxing, or climbing on top of a car to drunkenly egg on bare-knuckle boxers. "By all means, you can drink a couple beers, even green beers, and have a good time, but maybe cool it with the Jameson shots and definitely no Irish coffee, okay? Remember, you racked up $42 million in medical bills last St. Patrick's, and that's before accounting for fire department overtime." The nation further emphasized that it honestly wanted Boston to enjoy itself, and did not expect the city to maintain the quiet atmosphere of sullen, resentful drunkenness with which residents observed Black History Month.

Mom Still Raving About Butternut Squash Ravioli She Tried 13 Years Ago
PORTSMOUTH, NH — Calling the dish one of the tastiest she's had in some time, 61-year-old mom Karyn Stockton continued to rave Thursday about the butternut squash ravioli she tried 13 years ago during a vacation to Boston. "Who would have thought to put squash into ravioli?" Stockton said of the pasta dish she consumed in 2005 at West End restaurant Riccardo Trattoria and has been bringing up intermittently while out at other restaurants and even during lulls in casual conversation. "I think it had some sage in the sauce. Or maybe it was tarragon? I swear, we should try to make it some time. Gosh, it was a great dinner. I wish you'd have been there." At press time, Stockton revealed that she once bought a frozen version that looked similar at Sam's Club, but that it just wasn't the same.

Sully Sullenberger Realizes It Too Late Now To Let Everyone Know Plane Did All That Stuff On Autopilot
SAN FRANCISCO — Admitting it would be rather awkward to come clean at this juncture now, retired American Airlines pilot Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger realized Friday that it was almost certainly too late to let everybody know that the Airbus A320 of flight 1549, which landed in the Hudson on Jan. 15, 2009 with no loss of life to any of the 155 souls aboard, did so while on autopilot. "I pretty much just made some settings and pressed a button," said Sullenberger, confessing he likely should have divulged the inconsequential nature of his role in the "miracle on the Hudson" before Time magazine named him one of the "Top 100 Most Influential Heroes And Icons Of 2009." "Everybody was so happy, and I guess I just sort of got caught up in the moment, because it seemed like it would be just awful to spoil the mood. I mean, I really did press the button, but beyond that I was just along for the ride like everyone else. Don't get me wrong, it was a scary experience. The autopilot isn't always perfect, though as you can see, it's pretty damn close." Sullenberger said that he had planned to come clean when the producers of Sully approached him about a film deal, but decided to maintain his silence upon learning he would be played by Tom Hanks.

Salamanders Bravely Offer To Go Extinct In Place Of Better Animal
EARTH — Insisting that the planet's resources could be put to far better use than toward their own paltry existence, the world's salamander population reportedly gathered Thursday to bravely announce their willingness to go extinct in the place of a better animal. "We'll do it. We're small, slimy, and stupid, and we don't have much effect on anything — it's for the best, really," said the vast coalition of amphibians, solemnly stating their willingness to "go ahead and take one for the team" on behalf of several critically endangered and "way cooler" species such as the black rhino, hawksbill turtle, or the Sumatran elephant. "Look, we've kind of peaked. And there are tons of other different types of amphibians and lizards that pretty much check all the same boxes we do. Honestly, you'll hardly even notice we're gone. Polar bears, on the other hand? Those will be missed way more. It's really no contest. If anyone has to go extinct, it should be us." At press time, a herd of several hundred thousand salamanders were spotted running full speed toward the edge of a 600-foot cliff.

NYC Opens $500 Million Decoy Subway Station To Catch Turnstile Jumpers
NEW YORK — In a new effort by the MTA and law enforcement to crack down on fare evasion, New York City reportedly opened a $500 million decoy subway station this week to catch turnstile jumpers. "This sprawling, state-of-the-art station will have all the sights and sounds of a regular terminal, including turnstiles that will not accept MetroCards regardless of their available balance, increasing the likelihood of attempts to avoid payment," said MTA project manager Greg Langdon, adding that the act of fare evasion would cause the floor to open up, sending the commuter down a chute connected to a windowless underground holding cell. "From the outside, there will be signage indicating that the very realistic station serves every train in the system. Upon entry, the station's 500 security cameras will automatically capture high-definition photographs and videos of travellers and send them directly to the nearest precinct to be referenced against arrest records. A mix of plainclothes police and SWAT officers will also be on hand to help detain and interrogate anyone trying to ride for free. We hope to completely eliminate fare dodgers by adding decoy stations throughout the city." At press time, Langdon added that to cover costs for this pilot program, the MTA would be closing 472 stations.

Panicked Falcons Discover Scratch In Mercedes Benz Stadium
ATLANTA, GA — Pacing and cursing as they searched in vain for a note, the entire Falcons roster reportedly panicked Friday after finding a massive scratch in Mercedes Benz Stadium. "Dammit, who did this? It's halfway down the whole thing! Christ, this is going to cost a fortune to fix," said a distressed Matt Ryan as he attempted to buff out the scratch with the crumpled-up end of his sleeve. "This was a brand new stadium, too. It's barely a year old and it's already ruined. It's so obvious, too, everybody is going to see this big, ugly gash during the game. Man, [Coach] Dan [Quinn] is gonna flip his shit." At press time, the Falcons had been distracted from the scratch after noticing someone had pried the Mercedes Benz symbol off the front of the stadium.

Nation's Gratuitously Sexual Couples Announce Plans To Wait In Line At Six Flags
WASHINGTON — Interrupting various stages of excessive public intimacy to address the general population, the nation's gratuitously sexual couples announced plans Thursday to wait in line at Six Flags amusement parks across the country. A representative for the country's overly intimate couples confirmed a multi-part initiative that includes arriving at all 19 Six Flags parks in the United States, entering lines for various attractions, and playfully groping, kissing, caressing, pinching, and tickling one another in plain view of all park attendees. "On behalf of all sexually unrestrained couples throughout the country, I would like to advise Americans that as soon as you arrive at the entrance line for Six Flags, we will be there, cramming our tongues down each other's throats," said spokesman Brent Rossino, addressing the media while wrapping his arms around his girlfriend from behind and gently playing with her belly button piercing as they stood in line for the Kingda Ka roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J. "We will engage in similar behavior while in line for every ride, every food stand, and every carnival game inside the park. It doesn't matter if families, senior citizens, or entire youth groups are nearby — we will make out and cup various parts of each other's bodies in front of any and all other visitors." "And we will do this throughout the day," Rossino added. "Whether it's 9 a.m. or 10 p.m., I will be repeatedly slapping her ass with my plastic Coke bottle right in front of you." Rossino confirmed that the nation's immodest couples would fondle one another within just inches of fellow park patrons, while at the same time making loud references to their future sexual activity later in the evening. In addition, the grossly libidinous men and women revealed plans for ceaseless physical contact while in line for the Mind Eraser ride, often slowing the flow of foot traffic as they lean against handrails with their thumbs in their partners' waistbands. The couples added that, as they wait to board Batman: The Ride or any of the parks' other inverted roller coasters, the male partner will run his tongue along the woman's shoulder blade and neck while lightly stroking her thighs and then make a series of sexual remarks beginning with, "I know what else you're going to ride tonight." Furthermore, the gratuitously sexual couples revealed that while standing in line to order concessions, the female partner, wearing a tight-fitting tank top and clear bra straps, will lift up her boyfriend's basketball jersey and run her hands from his abs to the small of his back before they feed sugar and cinnamon churros into one another's mouths in an unpleasant, erotically charged spectacle. "As soon as I get in line at Hurricane Harbor, I plan on squealing aloud for everyone to hear as my boyfriend rubs his hands along the exposed skin above my low-rise jean shorts, and then I'll giggle suggestively when he asks if I'm prepared to get 'super wet,'" girlfriend Cristina Moran, 27, said of her upcoming visit to Six Flags New England. "After that, we'll make out for eight to 12 minutes straight, generating loud sucking and smacking noises while I tug on his Metallica World Tour T-shirt." "If you're in line near us, we may accidentally graze you as we run our hands up and down each other," Moran continued. At press time, the male partners confirmed that if anyone said anything about or even looked at their girl, they would knock out all their fucking teeth.

New Six Flags Ride Based On Relationship With Deborah
VALENCIA, CA — Promoting the coaster as "the most heartbreaking ride on earth," the Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park unveiled its newest attraction this week: a 395-foot-tall steel roller coaster designed to simulate a grueling three year relationship with Deborah. Developed by world-renowned and recently single engineer Phillip Werner, the Life Force Crusher-X is said to feature six disorienting vertical loops, 150-feet of highly unstable barrel rolls, a portion in the middle where the ride just suddenly stops for no reason and refuses to start again until riders apologize, and an unexpected 310-foot drop at the very end. "This heart-racing, gut-wrenching 90 mph free fall into unhealthy codependence and trust issues will have even the most extreme thrill-seekers begging for it to be over," reads a Six Flags press release announcing the new coaster, which promises to require more attention and patience than any one man should reasonably be expected to have. "Can you survive the Agonizing Vortex of Unflagging Acrimony?" According to park officials, the coaster begins with an impulsive burst of acceleration that, when riders reflect upon the experience years later, will prove to be the only enjoyable portion of the ride. A series of unexpected and painful twists rapidly follow, leaving riders confused, strangely resentful, and wondering if they made a huge mistake getting on the ride in the first place. For the next 25 minutes, the coaster creeps endlessly forward at an agonizing pace, until it actually starts moving backward. When the Life Force Crusher-X mercifully comes to an end, park visitors often find themselves speechless, emotionally exhausted, and completely broke. "What the fuck just happened?" roller coaster enthusiast Derek Schumer said. "At first things were great, but next thing I knew, I was throwing my hands in the air and screaming, ''Why are we even doing this? I don't understand why we're doing this! It doesn't make either of us the least bit happy. Just end it, already, just end it!" Added Schumer, "I think I'm going to be sick." Despite only opening last week, Life Force Crusher-X is already one of Magic Mountain's main attractions. The park has even been forced to extend its hours to accommodate ticket holders who said they would never come back, only to find themselves pounding on the gates at 2 a.m., desperate for just one more go-round. "I can't decide if I hate the ride or hate myself for going on it," read one comment on a website that reviews roller coasters. "At one point I glanced over at the people on other coasters, and they all looked so much happier." "I don't know," the comment continued. "Maybe the Life Force Crusher-X is just the type of coaster I deserve." Park-goer Andrew Murray had a similar experience on the Six Flags ride. "Pretty early on, I realized that I just needed to get off," Murray said. "But by that point we had just passed through the Tunnel of Pregnancy Scares, and there was no way I could up and leave then. God, to think of all the other rides I could have tried if I weren't trapped on that suffocating machine." Although some have expressed safety concerns with the coaster's structure — more than 7,000 feet of steel tubular track hastily built on a foundation of lust and shared contempt- — both Six Flags and the designer himself have assured riders that the Life Force Crusher-X is nowhere near as dangerous as actually dating Deborah. "Every inch of my coaster has been biodynamically analyzed by computers to be 100 percent safe, which is far more protection than I ever got from that heart-swallowing banshee of a woman," designer Werner said at the unveiling of his semi-autobiographical ride. "In fact, I myself ride the Crusher every morning. Just to remember." Six Flags officials said they've already begun construction on their next coaster, one they are calling "even more terrifying than being in a relationship with Deborah." It's scheduled to open in 2012 and will be based on not being in a relationship with Deborah.

Angolan War Criminal Called In As Character Witness To Manafort Fraud Trial
ALEXANDRIA, VA — In an effort to showcase the former Trump campaign manager's most positive attributes, Angolan war criminal Abilio Macanga was called to act as a character witness Friday in the Paul Manafort fraud trial. "Paul is a savvy businessman, an upstanding member of his community, and, above all else, one of my closest friends," said Macanga, a warlord personally responsible for the brutal slaughter of thousands of innocent women and children during the Angolan Civil War. "When I was down on my luck during a particularly difficult diamond smuggling operation, Paul stood by me. And when I was almost assassinated in a coup by my own soldiers, Paul lent me the money to pay the mercenary I used to hunt down and murder the families of those who betrayed me. I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for that defendant right there, Paul Manafort." At press time, Manafort's defense called up their next witness, a trembling former intern who insisted his boss was a great guy who never once threatened to break his fucking legs so bad he'd be walking sideways the rest of his life.

Pope Makes First Papal Visit To Six Flags
EUREKA, MO — Pope Benedict XVI returned to Rome today following a historic, three-day trip to Six Flags St. Louis, the first official papal visit to a major American theme park since Pope Paul VI's Thanksgiving Mass at Wet 'n Wild in August 1966. As the park opened its doors to the general public last Friday, the pope emerged from the last car of the Foghorn Leghorn National Park Railway to greet the throngs of people who had assembled hours earlier for a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pay their respects to the blessed pontiff and to vie for a seat on Superman Tower of Power, a popular free-fall ride. The pope began his visit with a brief sermon delivered from the balcony of the Old Glory Amphitheatre, and blessed the park's many concession-stand workers who "provide sustenance for our brethren seeking to beat the heat." "My friends in Christ, as we stand together today among this unusually large weekday crowd, I urge you and your children to exercise the twin virtues of faith and patience, for unto those who wait will come great rewards and monstrous thrills," the pontiff told those in line for the Screamin' Eagle roller coaster. The pope was honored in a special ceremony outside the Warner Bros. Backlot, in which he was presented with a complimentary season pass, good for free entry at any Six Flags or Hurricane Harbor until August 31. "I am pleased to announce to His Holiness, the Vicar of Christ, Pope Benedict XVI, that from this day forward, June 9 will forever be known as Pope Day at Six Flags St. Louis," said Shazam! ride-operator Gary Moynihan as he lowered the safety bar over the pope's lap and locked it into place. "Now, prepare to be scrambled!" The pope took an aerial tour via Sky Tram to Goodtimes Square later on Friday, where he was greeted by Six Flags dignitaries Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and the Tasmanian Devil. The trio of characters went on to sign an apostolic exhortation on the role of bishops, a Vatican concordat with Six Flags St. Louis, and the pope's personal autograph book. The pontiff also posed for an official portrait by celebrated Six Flags caricature artist Trevor Doogan. The work depicted Benedict in his robes, mitre, and Rollerblades. The pope also celebrated a special midday Mass, in which the capacity-plus crowds received communion and cotton candy. Early Saturday morning, Benedict delivered a children's prayer in Looney Tunes Town, in which he urged "courage, resolve, and strength of stomach when you come face to face with the temptation of XCalibur," and stressed that they should all "honor thy mother and father, who paid the ultimate price for your $45 day pass." "If you are a child over 54 inches tall, your covenant with fun compels you to check out Batman the Ride," the pope added. On the third day of the papal visit, bystanders witnessed what some called a minor miracle when Benedict reunited a lost four-year-old boy with his parents. "Today, a young wayward sheep has strayed from his flock, "the pope announced over the park's P.A. system. "But by the grace of God, he has been found safe and unharmed, and can be picked up at Porky's Pavilion." According to Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls, Benedict accomplished everything he set out to do during the three days, with the exception of a much-anticipated visit to Colossus, the 18-story Ferris wheel, which the Holy Father canceled at the last moment for unspecified reasons. "This is truly a special part of the world, and my time at Six Flags brought me closer to God — particularly when I was suspended in midair at the peak of Mr. Freeze," said the pope, his hair tousled, his face and the back of his neck severely sunburned, and his long, flowing robes soaked with water from the Big Kahuna raft ride. "But there is still much more to be done, and I have a feeling that God will call me here again very soon."

North Korea Tests Out New Knife In Smaller Escalation Of Threats To U.S.
PYONGYANG — In what appeared to be a more modest escalation of threats against the United States and its allies in the region, North Korea announced Thursday it had tested out a new knife, conducting a series of trial cuts with the weapon that state media described as "a great success." "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has completed the development of a powerful new blade capable of traveling an entire arm's length," read a report from the Korean Central News Agency issued hours after U.S. satellite imagery confirmed researchers in a remote mountain region of the country had repeatedly thrown the knife end over end in an attempt to see if they could get it to stick in a tree trunk. "This weapon is capable of being waved around in a slashing motion within a one-meter radius of whoever holds it, and it can travel even farther when flung really hard. The DPRK will not be deterred in its pursuit of such technology by the American hypocrites, who possess hundreds, if not thousands, of knives." Despite its bellicose tone, U.N. officials estimate North Korea is still three to four years away from developing a whetstone capable of honing the knife to the level of sharpness necessary to pierce human skin.

John Boehner Beheads Juarez Cartel Member Who Dared Muscle In On His Legal Weed Turf
FLINT, MI — Warning that he ran the only drug game in town as he firmly tugged back on the offender's hair, Acreage Holdings executive John Boehner beheaded a Juarez Cartel gang member Wednesday in order to thwart an attempt to muscle in on the legal weed game. "Say adios, pendejo!" said the blood-splattered former House speaker, wielding his machete in one hand and the lackey's severed head in the other while explaining that this was what happened when someone tried to mess with one of the largest legal marijuana distributors and growers in the country. "That'll teach you and the other bastards in the Juarez gang to disrespect $119 million in seed funding and a diversified portfolio of cannabis dispensing operations. And, just in case they don't get the point, I'm sending your poor little head down to Chihuahua as a gift so your compadres know to keep their ditchweed the hell out of Flint." At press time, Boehner had stubbed out his cigarillo, loosened his bandolier, and sent the order to Acreage agents to flood the cartel's border tunnels.

Scholars Say Constitution Is Open To Differing Interpretations Because Nobody Can Read That Crazy Script
WASHINGTON — As they cleaned their eyeglasses and stared at the faded, yellowing document through squinted eyes, the nation's top constitutional scholars admitted Monday that the U.S. Constitution is open to differing interpretations because no one can read that crazy script. "After the heated negotiations of the Constitutional Convention, the Founding Fathers somehow neglected to recopy the document in a neat or even legible hand, thus their original intent is really anybody's guess," said legal scholar Cass Sunstein during a panel at the National Archives, where top law experts and historians conceded they had no idea whether Article II of the Constitution vests executive power in a "president," or simply a "resident," of the United States. "We're in agreement that there are big headings with numbered articles, but once the rest of the text comes into play, we don't have a clue. We found one word that as far as we can tell just says 'sftcwafe,' but that can't be right. And take a look at those old-timey cursive F's — or are they S's? Or I's? In any case, they're totally out of control." At press time, the scholars released a statement in which they acknowledged that even calling the country "the United States of America" is largely a matter of conjecture.

New Poll Finds Millennials Far More Likely To Politically Identify As Feudalists Than Previous Generations
WASHINGTON — Revealing a profound transformation of American socioeconomic attitudes, a new Gallup poll published Tuesday found that millennials were far more likely to politically identify as feudalists than previous generations. "Our survey showed that Americans born between 1981 and 1996, more so than any other age demographic, strongly support the holding of a lord's lands in exchange for military service and labor," said lead researcher Stewart Mayberry, explaining that the political disruption that resulted from the 2016 election cycle prompted millions of millennials to reconsider ideas about vassals pledging an oath of fealty to landed nobility that has been considered odious to much of the American public since the 17th century. "While baby boomers negatively associate 'feudalism' with William the Conqueror and the forfeiture of wages in order to remain in the fiefdom, those in the younger generation see it as an opportunity to make their voices heard by providing counsel to their lord. A large percentage of millennials will even go so far as to reject the Tenures Abolition Act of 1660 entirely." Mayberry also noted that the trend extended to Gen Z, which has advocated for doing away with political systems entirely and returning to a state of nature.

KitchenAid Announces It Will Lift Ban On Selling Mixers To Unwed Women
BENTON HARBOR, MI — Acknowledging a shift in prevailing cultural attitudes, KitchenAid announced Friday it would no longer prohibit sales of its flagship product, the stand mixer, to women who are not married. "We recognize that in today's world, many women who bake may also wish to remain single, which is why we're pleased to announce that, effective immediately, we will cease requiring female customers to produce a marriage license or proof of bridal registry when buying a KitchenAid mixer," said company representative Helen Scharf, adding that for the first time, women would also be allowed to purchase the brand's products without the presence or permission of a husband or guardian. "We've always considered ourselves a family company, but with more lifestyle choices available to women than ever before, we believe the time has come to extend the benefits of properly sifted flour and well-kneaded dough to all, regardless of whether they identify as spinsters, old maids, or even harlots. It is of course our hope that women ultimately decide to use our products to attract a man by making baked goods and other delicious treats for him." Despite these changes, Scharf confirmed KitchenAid would continue its longstanding policy of voiding the lifetime warranty on any product owned by a divorced woman.

Piece Of Shit Whom Everybody Hates Assures Himself It All In His Head
MILTON, WI — Doing his best to cast the negative, intrusive, and ultimately accurate thoughts from his mind, local piece of shit Aaron Keliher, whom everyone fucking despises, reportedly assured himself Thursday that it's all in his head. "Sometimes, when I'm getting really down on myself, I start to think people must just hate me," said the fucking loser, who, according to multiple sources, is in fact hated by pretty much everybody because he has no redeeming qualities anyone could ever find worthwhile and, honestly, just kind of sucks. "I need to keep these bad feelings in check. Otherwise, I'll spiral and wind up in a dark place. Like just last week, I was convinced I had done some silly thing to piss off [an acquaintance who was indeed pissed off by the total shitheel, and with good reason]. But in all likelihood, it had nothing to do with me at all." The piece of shit went on to voice the incorrect assumption that his mother had not yet returned his last few calls to her because she was probably really busy.

Corner Store Customers Saddened By Sight Of Frantic Trump Doing Scratch-Off Tickets Right On Counter
WASHINGTON — Watching as the president of the United States checked each of his pockets in search of enough change to keep playing, customers at a D.C. convenience store were reportedly saddened Friday to see Donald Trump frantically doing scratch-off tickets right there on the counter. "A lot of hard-up folks come in for the lotto, but this guy's here at least a couple times a day — whenever he can scrape together the cash for another ticket, I guess," said store clerk Draymond Finch, who looked on as the commander in chief ineffectually clawed at a scratch-off with a dirty fingernail before handing it back and asking Finch to tell him if he had won or not. "One time, I saw him win $8, and he was absolutely over the moon. Then he immediately spent his winnings on more tickets, all of which came up short. Honestly, this guy needs to pull himself together. Pretty soon, he'll start asking my customers if they can spare a buck, and then I'll have to shoo him out of here, just like I do every day." At press time, sources confirmed President Trump had accused Finch of deliberately selling him losing tickets and was angrily demanding a refund.

Turkish Restaurant Thrown Into Complete Disarray By Entry Of Single Customer
CHICAGO — Evidently perceiving a distinct change in the Turkish restaurant's atmosphere, dinnertime sources confirmed that eatery Taste Of Istanbul was thrown into complete disarray Tuesday by the entry of a single customer. "A couple guys were sorting silverware as I walked in, but once they noticed me, they just hauled ass to the kitchen, where there was hurried conversation for a few moments before someone in the back shouted that I could sit anywhere I like," said the lone patron, 33-year-old Sam Schonart, who further elaborated that several employees eventually approached his table to take his order, each of them setting down a separate cup of Turkish tea. "I asked the waiter about the soup of the day. He excused himself to check, but it took him around 10 minutes to figure it out. A bunch of little kids were running in and out of the dining room the whole time, so I guess it's a family-run place? There were also a bunch of older guys playing backgammon in the side room, and I wasn't sure if they were customers or what, but one of them did ask if I was enjoying my meal. Actually, I felt kind of bad because everyone seemed much more relaxed before I got there." Schonart, who later became certain he had been forgotten, was halfway out the door when his order of doner kebab was placed on his table.

Freedom-Wielding High Schooler Freedoms Down 16 Classmates In Latest Mass Freedoming
NORTHAMPTON, MA — In a deadly exercise of freedom that has already sparked nationwide debate, authorities confirmed Tuesday that freedom-wielding high school sophomore Langston Perry Shamet freedomed down 16 classmates in the latest in a series of mass freedomings. "This tragedy was a senseless act of freedom perpetrated by a young man who was able to get his hands on freedom without going through any background checks," said activist Wesley Monroe, citing video footage that showed Shamet practicing with his legally purchased freedom at a public freedom range just days before using semi-automatic freedom to incapacitate his school's security guard and exercise his God-given freedom upon several dozen classmates. "These demonstrations of our freedoms are just getting bigger and bigger and claiming more and more lives. This was already the 24th mass freedoming at a public school since January, not to mention one of the bloodiest. While some find it convenient to blame certain video games which crudely express freedom, this tragedy represents a failure of the state to ensure the welfare of its citizens. Police had ample advance warning that Wes was a freedom nut, and they refused to act before he had already committed a brutal celebration of his personal freedom. It's a shame that people are reacting to this crisis by advocating for the public to acquire more and deadlier freedoms instead of taking a closer look at the damage these freedoms have done to so many innocent Americans." Families of the victims of this latest freedom have, in the meantime, requested privacy in this immense time of freedom.

Mike Gravel Can't Believe His Polling Numbers Neck-And-Neck With Fucking Nobody Like Wayne Messam
BURLINGAME, CA — Stressing that he is a "two-term United States senator for Christ's sake," White House Democratic hopeful Mike Gravel told reporters Wednesday that he can't believe he's polling neck-and-neck with a fucking nobody like Florida mayor Wayne Messam. "That Messam prick's been in politics for, what, a few years? I was a legislator in nineteen-fucking-sixty-three. I should be in with the big dogs like Bernie or Liz Warren, not slumming it in the pissant 20,000-donors club," said the 88-year-old prospective candidate, who added that "you would think a name like Mike goddamn Gravel would carry a little more weight than a mayor of some podunk town in godforsaken Florida." "I'm the son of a bitch who read the Pentagon Papers into Congressional Record. Now, I'm competing to qualify for debates with this no-name Messam asshole, not to mention that hippy-dippy bullshit author Marianne Whatever-The-Hell-Her-Name-Is [Williamson]. I'm not even polling at 1% yet. Is it me or is there something really fucked with that picture? Wayne Messam, my ass." At press time, Messam had pulled ahead of Gravel in the polls.

Bird Reflects On Frailty, Impermanence Of Life After Finding Dead Human On Sidewalk
PITTSBURGH — Alighting on the concrete to study the colorful but lifeless body, a sparrow reflected on the fragile and fleeting nature of life Thursday after coming across a dead human on the sidewalk. "Looking at it, so still and delicate, lying there on the ground, it just reminds you that each and every one of us has but a short time to spend on this Earth," said the migratory grassland insectivore, admitting he didn't usually take time to think about the nature of mortality, but that seeing a lifeless human sprawled on a sidewalk, on a lawn, or even rebounding limply from the windshield of a passing car, was enough to make anyone stop and think. "The poor thing. Sad that it probably died all alone. Life really is all the more precious for being temporary, you know? I'm just glad my species abandons its fledglings after roughly 20 days — I'd hate to have to talk to my kids about this." At press time, the common raven to whom the sparrow had been speaking noted that the dead human's eyes were delicious.

Special Guest At Sea Lion Show Just Another Sea Lion
SAN DIEGO, CA — After waiting in mounting anticipation for nearly an hour only to be duped by an identical marine mammal, audience members voiced their disappointment Thursday in the revelation that the so-called "special guest" appearing at SeaWorld's sea lion show was, in fact, merely an additional sea lion. "They've been hyping this up for the last 45 minutes. I had my camera ready for a really cool surprise performer, but no, all we get is another sea lion," said Enid Grossman, who, like most other guests in attendance, had assumed the use of swirling spotlights and high-energy music throughout the show indicated the mysterious guest would be a celebrity of some sort or, at the very least, a different sort of animal. "I know the show is called 'Sea Lions Tonite,' but there were already a bunch of them doing tricks and stuff this whole time. Even when they announced 'Mayor Flipper' and brought out more buckets of fish, I was hoping for a dolphin. But nope. I came to this aquarium alone to enjoy the show, and I don't think I was wrong to have a certain level of expectation, but this is clearly false advertising. I can't believe this is happening to me again." Grossman, who swore never to return, nevertheless stayed for the entire performance and seemed to enjoy the grand finale, in which all five sea lions formed a line and balanced beach balls on their noses.

Couple Tired Of Always Having Same Knife Fight
BOSTON — Expressing frustration after finding themselves in the same old predictable dispute again, local couple Melanie Kinsey and Derrick Alterman admitted Friday that they were growing tired of always having the same knife fight. "More often than not, I'll be tired and irritable and take a few little swipes at her here and there, and then she gets defensive and just lashes out at me — which I understand, but I don't know if it's proportional to bring up stuff I did before we were dating, or to use a machete," said Alterman, adding that on occasions when alcohol is involved, the altercations have been known to escalate brutality to the point where neighbors have called the police. "Sure, on the surface, it's just a little knife-fight about dishes someone — okay, that I left in the sink tonight, but really we both know what the underlying knife-fight is really about. Plus, Melanie really knows my most vulnerable spots, and she always goes for them first. We both know exactly how to hurt each other. Frankly, I'm exhausted from all this." Kinsey, for her part, said she fears the couple may keep rehashing this same knife fight until one of them finally leaves and comes back with an axe.

Trump Warns China Not To Underestimate His Willingness To Sacrifice Every American's Well-Being
WASHINGTON — Stating that he would be sticking to his guns regardless of the consequences, President Trump warned China in a White House press briefing Thursday that its leaders should not underestimate his willingness to sacrifice the well-being of every single person in the United States. "If you think for one second I'm about to back down on this trade war, you've clearly failed to grasp my complete indifference toward the entire population of my country," said the president, who affirmed his unwavering commitment to letting the price of consumer goods rise, even if it meant a certain number of American families might struggle to make ends meet or be forced to go hungry. "I'm not about to lose a fight just because we have a bunch of farmers who depend on Chinese markets and workers who will lose their jobs if factories can't get Chinese raw materials. Believe me, I can tolerate a tremendous amount of their pain." Trump went on to state that most Americans are "great patriots" and willing to suffer so that he can get anything wants.

Local Teen Invents Masturbation
NAPERVILLE, IL — In what is being heralded as a scientific breakthrough on par with Copernicus' heliocentrism or Einstein's theory of relativity, sources confirmed Thursday that local 13-year-old Shane O'Donnell invented masturbation. O'Donnell's study of the effects of pillow-humping on the brain's pleasure center reportedly led the pre-teen to experiment with placing a hand on his genitals and tugging, which was followed by a groundbreaking trial-and-error period involving a variety of tempos and grips. O'Donnell, who called the innovation a eureka moment, then isolated a stroke and grasp that "felt real nice." Sources reported that the visionary then implemented a never-before-attempted jerking of the penis shaft that yielded what the sixth-grader hypothesized was an erection, later confirmed when increased yank speed produced "some stuff" that O'Donnell referred to as "splooge." The massive leap forward in sexual stimulation builds off the unprecedented research of 12-year-old classmate Jason Whitman who confirmed at the bike racks that he recently experimented with placing his penis into the stream of a hot tub jet. At press time, several reports indicated close friends have not seen O'Donnell since he invented masturbation and that his mom keeps saying he's in the shower.

R.L. Stine Admits Every Book He's Written Directly Dictated To Him By God
COLUMBUS, OH — Revealing at long last the creative process behind a successful career during which he has written over 300 books, best-selling children's author R.L. Stine disclosed during an interview Monday that all of his writing is dictated to him directly by God. "One morning, I was walking in the woods behind my house when lo! I suddenly heard the voice of the Lord ring out, commanding me to transcribe His message. I fell to my knees and received His divine command to publish His truths, verbatim, in a series of 120-page horror fiction books for kids to purchase at Scholastic book fairs across the country," said Stine, insisting he could never take full credit for classics such as Say Cheese And Die or Phantom Of The Auditorium, as he had merely served as a conduit for the teachings of the divine Creator. "It could have been anyone on Earth, but He chose me to act as a herald of His voice and a vessel for His words, and I feel truly humbled. There were times when I cursed the tremendous burden of channeling The Supreme Being, and I often asked myself, 'Why me? Why must I be the one to write Under The Magician's Spell?' But I knew there was a higher purpose for me, much like that revealed in the divine text of Stay Out Of The Basement." Stine noted that like many readers, he, too, still wrestles with accepting that Slappy the Dummy is actually the next Messiah.

Agile, Dynamic Company Able To Respond To Any Challenge By Laying Off Half Of Staff
NEW YORK — Calling his employees a lean, versatile team capable of being fired at a moment's notice, local CEO David Bradford described his marketing firm Stact Media as an agile, dynamic company able to respond to any challenge by laying off half of its staff. "This industry is always evolving, but what makes us resilient is our ability to adjust to change, which is invariably done by eliminating 50% of our workforce to cut costs regardless of the problem," said Bradford, adding that the keys to a successful business in today's market was creating a corporate culture of cutting good, qualified people with a variety of skills while constantly finding innovative ways to throw a wrench into everyone's workflow. "When we encounter an obstacle, we don't go down without a fight against our most experienced, senior workers. We look everyone in the eye and say, 'The 20 of you who still work here will push on.' Whether axing production costs during a pivot to video or slashing editorial when page views are down, we react to problems quickly and without the input of those of us with a better, more nuanced understanding of how things work." Bradford added that another advantage demonstrated by his company is its ability to increase executive salaries during times of crisis.

FDA Launches Food Awareness Month To Get Americans Interested In Eating
WASHINGTON — In an effort to boost the nation's appetite, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that July would be designated Food Awareness Month as part of a program to rekindle American interest in eating. "We're excited to announce this campaign will stretch over the entire course of July and comprise programs to educate Americans about breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and even snacks," said FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, adding that the multi-billion-dollar ad campaign would include coordinated television PSAs, interstate billboards, and after-school programs designed to "put food out into the culture." "We just want more Americans to know they are free to eat any edible item, and that doing so has mostly positive effects. Far too many Americans are oblivious to food's nutritional benefits and, frankly, its great taste. The eating of food is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, but unfortunately, many people don't realize they have a hankering for sustenance until it's too late. Similar initiatives have worked wonders in Scandinavian countries, and with any luck, U.S. citizens will be digesting food in no time." Gottlieb further speculated that the program, if launched earlier, could have prevented the American Southwest from starving to death last February.

Netanyahu Begins Calling For Israeli Return To Ancient Homeland Of Iran
JERUSALEM — Declaring that it was long past time for his people to live once again on their ancestral soil, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly began calling Thursday for the Israeli return to their ancient homeland of Iran. "The land of Iran has long been part of our heritage, and we implore the international community to work with us to ensure its return to the independent Jewish state," said Netanyahu, adding that Israel was willing to use military force if necessary to reoccupy all 636,400 square miles of present-day Iran that were historically included in the promised land bestowed upon the Jewish people by biblical mandate. "The so-called Islamic cities of Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, and dozens of others were founded on what were once ancient Jewish kingdoms, not to mention how many of our most sacred sites Iran currently occupies, including the Imam Reza Holy Shrine, the Jamkaran Mosque, and the Zoroastrian Fire Temple of Chak-Chak. In fact, Iran is home to the highest concentration of Judaic ancient holy sites anywhere in the world outside of Mecca, Lumbini, and Vatican City. We demand that the Jewish people be permitted to return to ruling our ancestral Persian homelands." At press time, Netanyahu had approved plans to begin construction on a large Israeli settlement in downtown Tehran.

'The Voice' Amends Rules To Allow Votes From Those Who Aren't White Landowning Males
LOS ANGELES — In what television audience-representation advocates are terming a long-overdue change to an archaic system, NBC announced Wednesday that popular singing competition show The Voice has amended its rules to allow viewers who aren't white landowning males to cast their votes in the show's 17th season. "Until recently, the polling system on The Voice was a prejudiced anachronism, a relic from an unfortunate period of our history. We no longer live in the dark, backward days of 2011. It's time for a change," said NBC spokesperson Sarah Simari, explaining that the Founding Showrunners originally believed the only viewers educated and responsible enough to make judgments of vocal performances were respectable upper or middle-class white males who owned property. "It's about time we recognize that women and minorities can judge an overcooked amateur cover of Nina Simone's 'Feeling Good' just as well as any white man. Hopefully, these new changes will ensure that the winner of the record deal and $100,000 prize will reflect the opinions of free people everywhere." Representatives of rival network ABC announced they will work on amending the rules of American Idol, which currently counts Lionel Richie's votes as worth three-fifths those of a white person.

"Recognizing the hugest pumpkins is another way to honor the standard of excellence embodied by the Pulitzer Prize," said co-chair Ann Marie Lipinski, adding that the forklift and industrial platform scale to be used for Pulitzer weigh-ins had already been brought into the board's Columbia University office. "Over the years, we have conferred honors upon some of the most distinguished writers and artists in the nation, and all pumpkins under consideration will be required to have attained that same level of achievement. " Although the official Pulitzer finalists will not be announced until April, favorites to win include The New York Times, The Baltimore Sun, and "Big Bertha," a 1,587-pound pumpkin grown in Lodi, WI.

'Fear Not — She Means You No Harm,' Says Elizabeth Warren, Revealing Docile Hillary Clinton To Crowd
PHILADELPHIA — Sending terrified gasps through the audience as she pulled back a thick velvet curtain onstage to reveal the formidable politician, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren assured the thousands of progressive onlookers at the Democratic National Convention Monday night that the docile Hillary Clinton standing before them meant them no harm. "Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to fear this candidate, for despite her menacing reputation, she will not attack you or your progressive movement," said Warren, who then wowed those in attendance by signaling for the compliant Clinton to repeat a series of talking points about regulating financial institutions in an effort to prove that the presumptive Democratic nominee could easily be trained and was not roused into a horrible frenzy by the presence of radical reforms. "Despite the tales you may have heard, she is nothing but a tame, pragmatic Democrat. The terror she stirs inside you belies her true gentle nature. I assure you she is no threat to the policies you hold most dear." At press time, Clinton had broken free from her iron restraints, ripped off both of Warren's arms, and tossed the senator's body into the crowd.

Customers Relieved To See Perky 7-Eleven Cashier's Spirit Has Finally Been Crushed
COLUMBUS, OH — Expressing their appreciation that they were once again able to shop in peace, 7-Eleven patrons were reportedly relieved Friday to discover that the perky cashier had finally had his spirit crushed. "I've been dreading going in recently for fear of that chipper employee cracking jokes, asking how my day was going, and generally just ruining my 7-Eleven experience," said customer Aubrey Alexanian, confirming that the cashier's monosyllabic answers and refusal to make eye-contact during her latest trip represented a vast improvement. "I'm just trying to get my scratch tickets and point to the taquitos or hotdogs that I want with an absolute minimum of human interaction. Thankfully, it seems like this guy's realized his job is a soul-sucking nightmare, so it should be back to business as usual. For a while there, I was worried I was going to have to do all my shopping at the Hess gas station." Alexanian believed she had helped the process in her own way by always treating the cashier like subhuman trash.

North Korea Successfully Harvests Wheat In Show Of Growing Strength
ARLINGTON, VA — Calling the effort a dramatic display of the Asian country's powerful capabilities, officials from the RAND Corporation confirmed Wednesday that North Korea has successfully harvested wheat. "Our most generous estimates projected that they would not produce the cereal grain for at least another 15 years, but the evidence revealed that North Korea is far more advanced than expected," said lead analyst Art Bennett, explaining that the 20-square-foot wheat crop, which was cultivated outside of Pyongyang, could potentially lead to the development of flour within the next decade. "We can't say conclusively whether or not they actually filled an entire bushel basket. What we do know is that this progress has put the world on notice. North Korea could very well have bread by 2050." At press time, satellite images revealed that North Korean military had begun to assemble a rudimentary grain silo.

Nutritionists Report They Wouldn't Have To Figure Out Which Foods Were Bad For You If Americans Just Ate Normal For Once
BOSTON — Saying everything could be made a whole lot simpler with even a few halfway reasonable dietary choices, top U.S. nutritionists announced Tuesday they wouldn't have to spend all their time figuring out which foods were bad for you if the nation would just try eating normal for once. "It's really not that complicated: Eat a sensible amount of plain, ordinary food each day, and then we won't have to do all these confusing studies and you won't have to worry anymore," said Blair Amundsen of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who explained that Americans continually eat such large quantities of bad food — drinking 24-ounce mocha lattes in the morning, ordering pizza for lunch, making hot dogs for dinner — that it's almost impossible to determine which bad things are hurting them the most. "We wouldn't have to churn out all this goddamn research on red meat if you didn't eat it three meals a day, okay? So maybe just try something normal like a sandwich — not the huge kind with so much meat you have to cut it into pieces before you can fit it into your mouth, but a regular, standard-sized sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes and stuff on it. And don't try to correct your weird, bad eating habits with a diet of nothing but salad for a month, because that's weird and bad too. Please stop whatever you're doing now and, for like a week, just eat normal. We're every bit as exhausted as you are with all this food study shit." At press time, sources confirmed the nation's nutritionists were resigning en masse after seeing "doughnut bacon burger" and "alfalfa juice cleanse" simultaneously trending online.

Scalia Goes On Abortion Bender After Being Passed Over For Chief Justice
NORFOLK, VA — Saying "Fuck this shit, I'm stopping beating hearts with my bare hands," Justice Antonin Scalia, overlooked for the vacated position of Supreme Court chief justice, went on a spiteful abortion-performing bender over the weekend. "If I'm not going to be permitted a lasting judicial legacy, to hell with law and order," said Scalia, the conservative Reagan appointee who has served on the court since 1986. "I worked my ass off for 20 years, and no one cares. So, who gives a shit? Safe, legal abortions for all. Who wants one? " Scalia added that 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore "totally won that election, any idiot knows that.

Investigation Finds Man Wrongfully Imprisoned For 3 Of 76 Murders
POTOSI, MO — Almost two decades after Michael Hollings was put on death row for the murders of 76 men, women, and children across Missouri, evidence uncovered by an exclusive Onion investigation has exonerated him of three of the brutal slayings, restoring his dignity when he thought all had been lost. "I'm so happy to finally have my good name back," Hollings told reporters Wednesday from his cell at Potosi Correctional Center. "I always told people I could never, ever kill more than 73 people, but when you're locked in a cage all day, ain't no one going to hear you out." "I wish Mama could have seen this," added a tearful Hollings, in reference to his mother and fourth victim, Barbara Watts-Hollings. "She'd be real proud of her boy today." Frustrated by the incompetence of his public defender but determined to prove he was innocent of a negligible percentage of the horrific crimes for which he received a death sentence, Hollings wrote to reporters from this newspaper last year, confident they would work tirelessly to see justice done. The Onion's painstaking investigation, conducted by more than 50 dedicated journalists, revealed that prosecutors suppressed key evidence supporting Hollings' claim that on the same night he supposedly killed three 7-year-old girls at a slumber party in Blue Springs, he was in fact tearing out the organs of a jogger in the Columbia area. In addition, a DNA test released to reporters by an anonymous law enforcement source demonstrated conclusively that the semen taken from the three girls did not match the semen deposited by Hollings in the mouths, rectums, and eye sockets of his other victims. "It's hard when everyone thinks you did something terrible that you know you didn't do," said Hollings, adding that it made him sick to think of preying upon anyone under the age of 10. "But I'm glad at least you reporter guys believed in me when no one else would. Now I can walk around with my head held higher than it's been in a long time." "A lot higher," added Hollings, cracking a smile.

Lady Gaga Quashes Rumors That She Ever Thought Bradley Cooper Talented In Any Way
NEW YORK — Addressing the speculation that has circulated on social media since Sunday's Academy Awards broadcast, Lady Gaga made an announcement this week to quash any rumors that she ever thought Bradley Cooper was talented in any way. "A lot of gossip has been floating around about the two of us, so let me assure you that not once have I ever felt that Bradley Cooper possessed any real skills or anything resembling artistic merit," said the Oscar-winning songwriter, noting that if she conveyed any sign of respect toward the man who directed and appeared with her in the film A Star Is Born, she was simply doing her job as an actor. "The only reason people think I have a high regard for his craft is because, as performers, that's what we want you to think. In reality, I don't feel that way about him at all, and I hope this puts an end to any theories out there that I have ever considered Bradley to be anything more than a complete and utter hack." When reached for comment, Bradley Cooper told reporters that he is a huge fan of Lady Gaga, has been a huge fan of Lady Gaga since the first time he ever saw her, and would leave his partner and child to commit himself completely to Lady Gaga and her career if she would only say the word.

Archaeologists Discover First Hominid To Own Tools But Never Use Them
KANJERA, KENYA — In a groundbreaking find that provides new insight into early human behavior, a group of archaeologists from the Smithsonian Institute announced the discovery Friday of the first known hominid to own tools but never use them. "Based on the evidence we uncovered, it appears this ancient human ancestor was the earliest species to keep a variety of specialized stone implements nearby without ever picking one of them up and putting it to use," said Dr. Phillip Davidson, adding that the team unearthed a neatly arranged set of choppers, awls, and scrapers with no wear on their surfaces whatsoever, indicating they were never employed on even a single project. "Our findings suggest that these tools were procured by this early hominid in the Lower Paleolithic period, set down in a designated space in the individual's dwelling, and then simply stayed in the same spot untouched for the past 2 million years." Davidson added that the tools were found next to a set of completely unused stone hand weights and a formal animal-hide loincloth that the protohuman appears to have worn only one time.

Man Parallel Parking Tries To Leave Enough Room Between Cars To Infuriate Other Drivers Into Just Giving Up
SANTA MONICA, CA — Emphasizing that his thoughts were always and only for his fellow motorists, local parallel parker Ed Billings admitted Monday that he strives to leave just enough room between the cars ahead of or behind his own so that other drivers are eventually infuriated into simply giving up after a few abortive parking attempts. "All right, this looks like exactly enough space for the driver of a midsized sedan or small SUV to spend about 10 minutes giving it their best shot while other drivers honk at them before they finally get unnerved or annoyed and drive away," said Billings, 39, expertly evaluating the carefully calculated space between his 2005 Honda CR-V and the crossover SUV seven-eighths of a car length in front of him. "I want to leave just enough distance for a car of average size to struggle with taking a stab at several different angles of approach and getting exasperatingly close to wedging themselves into this spot before they finally just yell 'Fuck it' a few times and pound on their steering wheels before calling it quits. It's just a little thing I do for my fellow drivers. I also want to make sure I leave exactly the right space so that the person in front of me has to hit my front bumper while trying to back out." At press time, Billings was struggling to suppress his rage and frustration as the driver of a 2017 Smart Fortwo simply breezed into the undersized parking spot in a single attempt.

Reporter Spends Month Undercover In Mass Grave
SAN FERNANDO, MEXICO — In an effort to better connect with the men and women murdered by the Zetas drug cartel, Josh Sullivan, an investigative reporter for The Onion, eschewed modern conveniences and the comforts of home for a month, going undercover and posing as a corpse in a mass grave to gain an intimate understanding of the victims' plight. Ignoring numerous warnings, Sullivan, who earned a masters degree from the Columbia Journalism School in 1998, selflessly risked his own life by immersing himself in the unsanitary pit of human corpses to share, firsthand, the heartrending experiences of the 154 inhabitants within. "I knew the dangers going in, but I felt bound by my employer's sterling history of journalistic excellence to really throw myself into this story headfirst," Sullivan, 38, said. "It would be irresponsible to simply walk up to the edge of a mass grave and peer in. To really comprehend the conditions in this area, you need to get into the thick of it, at least four or five people deep." "I wanted a fresh perspective," Sullivan added. "And to thoroughly probe this problem, I had to be embedded at the bottom of the body pile. That's where you'll find the true horrors." Sullivan, who in order to gain access to the mass grave faked his death by closing his eyes and wearing the bloody clothes of a deceased resident, never revealed his true status as a living person. The investigative reporter said it took several weeks to earn the trust of the grave's inhabitants, but he eventually started to blend in with the locals after much diligent effort. "I really felt like I was an essential part of the community," Sullivan said. "The way of life down there — the behavior, the traditions, the customs — it all became like second nature to me." According to Sullivan, he spent his days quietly observing his surroundings from beneath the heap of cadavers, but also worked tirelessly at night. His movement restricted, he managed to type away on his laptop and provide readers of his live blog with instant access to anecdotes about waking up to the sound of drug cartel members dumping freshly killed bodies into the mass grave. Sullivan stated that while he was fully aware of the perils of his assignment, he realized he had to expose the gruesome conditions rather than worrying about his own safety or well-being. "You can't imagine how cramped and filthy it was — a truly forgotten corner of the world," said Sullivan, adding that many of the locals had few possessions and were often dressed in rags or simply naked. "It was utterly inhumane. I saw entire families packed into a space that wasn't much larger than a refrigerator." Acknowledging his commitment to outstanding journalism, Sullivan said it was vital to steep himself in the world of the mass grave completely, and he stressed the importance of actually touching the rotting occupants, smelling the various stages of decay, seeing the decomposing elderly and infants, hearing the maggots consuming flesh, and tasting the soil beneath which he was buried. While Sullivan can finally admit he suffered greatly during the harrowing experience, the journalist takes pride in the fact that his investigative report has helped to improve conditions for the dead bodies, which now have cleaner and more spacious mass graves. Colleagues in the journalistic community said Sullivan's work was historic and worthy of recognition for its excellence in Breaking News Reporting, International Reporting, Investigative Reporting, and Public Service.

Buick Introduces New Self-Buying Car
DETROIT — Saying it had radically reenvisioned the very concept of the autonomous vehicle, Buick on Tuesday unveiled the first-ever self-buying car. "In what marks a watershed moment for this company, we here at Buick are proud to present the first and only car that purchases itself," said Buick spokesman Matt Grossinger, calling the new Buick Acquisition revolutionary in its ability to put a down payment on itself automatically, removing the need for any human initiative at all. "Consumers can sit back and relax while the car evaluates different loan plans and warranties completely on its own, not to mention negotiate its own selling price with the dealer. In fact, buying a car will soon be as easy as looking outside your window to discover your existing car has been traded in, and a Buick has been parked in its place." At press time, despite the new technology, Buick sales remained stagnant.

Archaeologists Uncover Last Human To Die Happy
DEMBECHA, ETHIOPIA — In a startling find that contributes significantly to the understanding of modern man's evolutionary development, University of Edinburgh archaeologists working in Ethiopia's Afar Region announced Wednesday that they have uncovered the preserved remains of the last human to die happy. According to the researchers, carbon dating concluded that the fossilized skeleton is that of a Paleolithic man — nicknamed "Felix" by the team of scientists responsible for the find — who died perfectly contented and unencumbered by regret roughly 30,000 years ago. "It's truly incredible — Felix unequivocally demonstrates that early humans were still capable of dying completely fulfilled as late as the Upper Paleolithic," said lead researcher Evgenia Halytsky, who went on to say that scientists had previously believed any such trait had disappeared many millennia earlier. "The vast majority of research points to our species almost never experiencing even a day of serenity for the last million years, so Felix totally upends any of our previous notions about human evolution." "To think that only 300 centuries ago, a human being actually died happy," Halytsky added. Researchers said that a spectral analysis of the remains indicated wear in Felix's lower extremities consistent with a long, confident gait. Additionally, forensic odontology tests revealed that the man had never grinded his teeth, stunning scientists who had until now accepted that this behavior had become ubiquitous at roughly the same time humans developed abstract thought and the capacity to project into the future. Experts also said that measurements of the man's upper thoracic spine demonstrated that he had walked with his chest thrust forward optimistically and that his vertebrae were completely absent of any curvature that would have indicated his having gone through life with his head held in a drooping manner or with his eyes cast to the ground. But Halytsky told reporters that what is perhaps most exciting about the find is how it sheds light on a series of mysterious and, until now, incomprehensible prehistoric cave paintings discovered in 2009 less than a mile away from the new site. "We are now almost certain that the figure depicted in the paintings leading successful hunts and cheerfully brokering peaceful resolutions among his fellow tribesmen — who was initially regarded as some kind of mythological being — is in fact Felix," Halytsky said. "This also lends support to the theory that Felix died having been fully aware of the extent of his positive impact on his society, which appears to have been substantial." "Some of the drawings illustrate him enjoying a family life more loving, affectionate, and tolerant than any we've ever seen throughout prehistory or otherwise, leading us to believe that his heart was overflowing with his kinsfolk's love when he passed away," Halytsky continued. However, enthusiasm for the recent findings has reportedly been tempered by a competing theory that Felix was only content at the time of his death because he had decided to kill himself and end his agony all at once.

Michael Cohen Granted Prison Work Release For New Job With Trump 2020 Campaign
NEW YORK — Following sentencing for his role in a hush-money scandal, Michael Cohen was granted a prison work release for a new job with the Trump 2020 campaign, sources confirmed Wednesday. "We're confident that engaging in honest work will help Mr. Cohen with his rehabilitation," said warden Pete Clements, telling reporters that having an opportunity to give back to society by serving as an advisor for the 2020 Trump presidential campaign would help Cohen see the error of his past behaviors. "Once he arrives in March, Mr. Cohen will be bused from our penitentiary to Trump's Manhattan campaign office for an eight-hour work day before returning to prison each night. Mr. Cohen will be under strict supervision during these furloughs, which will allow him to use his skills for the betterment of the community and give him a chance to reintegrate into society." Clements added that Cohen's request for a position as the RNC's 2020 deputy finance chairman had been denied over concerns that the work environment would make it too easy to backslide into criminality.

Michael Cohen Relieved To Remember It Illegal To Charge Lawyer With Crime
NEW YORK — Admitting that he initially started to panic upon discovering that federal prosecutors were investigating him for charges of bank and tax fraud, Michael Cohen reportedly expressed relief Monday after remembering that it is illegal to charge a lawyer with a crime. "Wow, I was really freaking out there for a second thinking I was definitely going to prison, but then I remembered you have immunity from all criminal charges when you're a lawyer," said Cohen, adding that his concern over the mounting evidence that he was involved in multiple crimes while serving as President Trump's lawyer disappeared after he recalled the part of getting admitted to the bar that makes questioning a lawyer about anything they've ever done a Class A felony. "I can't believe I almost forgot that lawyers are the part of the legal system who talk about the laws when they prosecute and defend people for crimes, not the people who actually have laws applied to them. Lawyers obviously get attorney–legal system privilege. Jeez, though, that was close." At press time, Cohen was growing even more relaxed after recalling all the lawyers he knows who have committed scores of illegal acts and never received any punishment whatsoever.

Songs That Are Always On In Background Expected To Win Big At Grammys
LOS ANGELES — With the 56th Grammy Awards just days away, industry experts are predicting that the songs that are always playing at moderate volume from ceiling-mounted speakers in retailers, gas station canopies, and mall food courts will take home the biggest awards at Sunday's ceremony. "It is bound to be a huge night for that song that was playing in the movie theater before they started the trailers and the other one that you kind of know from when you go out to eat lunch — both are virtual locks for Grammy gold," said L.A. Times music critic Randall Roberts, who noted that the song from that car commercial that your coworker sometimes absentmindedly hums was a also a strong contender for Record of the Year. "Any of the songs that you've learned most of the chorus to through shopping at clothing stores or supermarkets but couldn't actually name — those are the ones you should be watching Sunday night. Basically, if you've heard a Jeep go by blaring it a couple of times in the past few months, it is almost certain to take the night's top honors." Roberts confirmed that the songs that you turn on to drown out those in the background were not nominated.

Ford CEO Worried He Never Bringing Back Jobs He Outsourced
DEARBORN, MI — Admitting he had spent many sleepless nights afraid he would never make things right with the American people, Ford CEO James Hackett expressed worry Wednesday he might not bring back any of the jobs he had shipped outside the country. "It's been a few years now since I moved production of the Ford Focus to China, and I'm terrified I may simply choose never to return those skilled positions to workers here in Michigan," said Hackett, voicing concerns echoed by many distressed CEOs across the manufacturing sector who, despite receiving permanent corporate tax cuts under the Trump administration, have not yet moved a single job back to their local economies from Latin America or Asia. "People were promised those jobs were coming back. I'm worried that may have been a lot of empty talk to make Americans feel better. We've always said that if we were able to lower wages and get a lower tax rate, we could do it, but I just don't think I'm going to." Hackett added that even more upsetting than the lack of good-paying job opportunities returning to the United States was the fact that he would face zero consequences for his inaction.

LOS ANGELES — Confessing that the "clumsy, ham-handed awkwardness" of his first and latest stabs at the medium make him want to crawl into a hole and die, YouTuber Jacksepticeye, known socially as Seán McLoughlin, confirmed Friday that he could not help but cringe while watching his amateurish early and current work. "I was so embarrassingly clueless back then, and also now," said McLoughlin of the irritating, difficult-to-watch videos he made when he first started vlogging in 2012, the higher-resolution but equally shoddy material he recorded in 2015, and the slapdash videos he posted earlier this week, questioning how he ever could have thought and continue to think people would be interested in watching him just sit and obnoxiously narrate as he plays video games. "It's so humiliating watching myself at 23, wearing that stupid Spurs hat with the tags still on it, not to mention the ones I'm making now as a 28-year-old man wearing a Cubs hat with the stickers still on it. Seriously, I can't even bring myself to watch anything during the six-year period in which I was, and remain, under the impression that just watching me be Irish and loudly curse a lot while I do a bunch of stupid impressions is worth anyone's time." At press time McLoughlin, who has earned $35,000 this year by documenting his progress in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, had greeted his viewers by saying "What's up, guys?" and entreating them to smash those "like" and "subscribe" buttons.

Authorities Praise Twitter Users' Rapid Response To Virginia Shooting
ALEXANDRIA, VA — Recounting how they rushed to the social media platform in a matter of moments, local authorities Wednesday praised Twitter users' rapid response to the shooting of a Republican congressman and four others. "We would like to acknowledge those Twitter users who, without any hesitation, immediately leaped into action after they saw the first headline about today's tragedy," said Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown, adding that they didn't think twice before assigning blame or fueling speculation, willingly engaging in petty arguments and personal attacks in a situation where any normal person would have just stayed away. "Focused and intent on getting their takes out there, they disregarded all consequences and, as if by instinct, jumped right into the fray, not wasting precious seconds confirming the veracity of their claims or checking the spelling of their statements." Brown went on to say that this level of dedication should come as no surprise to anyone, as Twitter users go above and beyond like this every single day.

Federal Reserve Cites Healthy Economy In Decision To Have Baby
WASHINGTON — Noting the robust financial backdrop and expectations for sustained growth, the Federal Reserve released a report Thursday citing the healthy economy in its decision to have a baby. "After lengthy discussions to address lingering concerns among board members about trends in the broader macroeconomy, I'm overjoyed to announce the Fed's plans to join together and raise a child," said Chairman Jerome Powell, explaining that even with significant headwinds in the global market, the central banking organization had unanimously agreed that the "time felt right" to procreate, adding that the child's name would likely be Oliver or Olivia and would be reared by all five of the nation's central bankers. "Of course, there's no perfect moment to have a kid — the softening market, for example, looms large in our forecasts about the child's future. But when you factor in the unemployment rate dipping below 4 percent, we really think we finally have our shit together to start a family. In fact, the rest of the Board of Governors and I already started trying last night." At press time, increased volatility in U.S.–China trade relations had prompted Powell to regretfully announce plans to get a cat instead.

Report: More Americans Forced To Sell Gold Pocket Watch In Order To Afford Set Of Fine Combs For Wife
NEW YORK — Citing the limited household budgets of many young married couples, a new report published Friday estimates that more Americans than ever this Christmas will be forced to sell a gold watch inherited from their father in order to buy a set of fine combs for their wife's beautiful hair. "Wages have remained flat while the cost of living has increased, a combination that could leave holiday shoppers in a bind as they attempt to find a gift that befits a woman whose cascade of shining brown hair is the envy of queens," said economist and report co-author Jay Dillingham, adding that retailers have given no indication they plan to offer any discounts this season on lavishly bejeweled combs of pure tortoiseshell. "Especially in major cities, where workers are spending even more of their income on rent than in the past, we can expect to see a growing number of steadfast and honorable husbands pawning an heirloom pocket watch, one that has been in their family for generations, in order to purchase a rare and elegant gift worthy of their true love's exquisite locks." The report went on to say that, in some cases, Americans may even have to hock their antique whalebone-and-silver walking sticks for the woman they cherish above all others.

Report: Girl Who Called You A Slut In High School Posting Passionate Status About Women's March
CHICAGO — Recalling how the former classmate would ruthlessly prey on insecurities, sources confirmed Monday that the girl who repeatedly called you a slut in high school was posting a passionate Facebook status about the Women's March. "I had the most amazing time out there with my sisters, and it really proved that when women stand together, we can change the world," wrote the woman who made your life a living hell for four years and once called you a skank in front of the entire cafeteria. "It's now important more than ever for women to be great role models for every young girl. The progress we make today will change the lives of women for generations to come." At press time, your former tormenter, who had scrawled the phrase "blowjob bitch" on your locker after noticing you sat next to her ex-boyfriend during a school assembly, posted an impassioned reminder for all women to stay strong in the face of adversity.

Mike Pence Disappointed In The 200,000 Husbands And Fathers Who Permitted Women To Attend March
WASHINGTON — Admonishing those responsible for failing to uphold their moral duties, Vice President Mike Pence expressed disappointment Saturday in the 200,000 husbands and fathers who had allowed the women and girls in their charge to attend the Women's March on Washington. "I can't tell you how let down I feel by the heads of these households who did not simply give their wives and daughters a firm, decisive 'no' when they asked to participate in today's demonstration," said Pence, noting with frustration that many of the protesters had been granted permission to travel across the country alone and stay for several days in a faraway city with no male chaperone whatsoever to guide and look after them. "There are a few men marching as well, so they must be the ones supervising this whole thing, and thank God for that. But I can't help but feel that these ladies' custodians — the ones who were supposed to be providing a masculine voice of reason on these sorts of matters — have really come up short today." Pence stressed that he, for example, had told his 23-year-old eldest daughter that it was simply out of the question when she mentioned she was thinking of attending the march.

Women's Strike A Sobering Reality Check For Subway Masturbator
NEW YORK — Alarmed at the aisles and seats all but devoid of female commuters, subway masturbator Doug Waters told reporters Wednesday that the Day Without A Woman strike served as a sobering reality check. "It never even occurred to me that this strike would have such an impact on my ability to discreetly pleasure myself during rush hour," said Waters, adding he was suddenly forced to take stock of just how much he depended on women when rubbing his genitals beneath a jacket on his lap. "I see now that I've taken for granted the women I masturbate to each and every day, and it's time I started appreciating what they do for me. I always knew I needed them — I just had no idea how much." At press time, Waters was touching himself with a new sense of gratitude while looking at the model in a small display ad for a technical college.

Antifa Organizers Announce Plans To Disrupt Neo-Nazi Rally Or Whatever Else Going On That Day
BERKELEY, CA — Vowing to derail whichever event it is by any means necessary, local Antifa organizers announced plans Monday to disrupt an upcoming neo-Nazi rally or whatever else is going on that day. "We will stop at nothing to prevent these vile fucking neo-Nazi hatemongers from gathering, or, if not them, someone else," said Sarah Jackson, 26, adding that the only way to end the spread of fascism is to physically confront Nazis, peaceful right-wing protesters, or just random people going about their daily lives. "We need to tell these Hitler-loving fucks or whoever else is standing there, 'Get out of our city!' Remember, we're talking about white supremacist terrorists, people running errands on their lunch breaks, or a group of tourists, so if we have to throw a punch or two, then so fucking be it." At press time, black-clad Antifa demonstrators screaming "Fascists, go home!" had swarmed a Scandinavian street festival.

That's 500 buckaroos right there — go on and count it!" said the sources, repeatedly licking their thumbs to separate the 25 individual $20 bills into five small stacks of $100 each. "Just smell that green! You ever see a wad that fat before? That is some serious dinero, my friend." At press time, sources confirmed an enormous gust of wind had blown the $500 out of their hands, across the sidewalk, and into a heavily trafficked street, with much of the cash disappearing down a sewer grate.

Recently Single Al Gore Finally Able To Listen To W.A.S.P. Albums
NASHVILLE, TN — Finally unhindered by his wife Tipper's 25-year-long household ban on violent and sexually explicit music, former vice president Al Gore, 62, reportedly embraced his newfound independence this week by listening to the albums of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P. "For the first time in decades, I get to play the kind of music I like without someone nagging me about what a bad influence it is," said Gore, sitting on the floor of his living room as he cued up the song "Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)" on his stereo. "And I get to crank it up as loud as I want." "These guys are kicking some serious ass," added the two-term U.S. Senator. "Check out this guitar break coming up — it's nasty." Gore, who was prohibited from hearing music with graphic sex, violence, or drug references since Tipper founded the Parents Music Resource Center in 1985, confirmed yesterday that her crusade was "total bullcrap." In addition, Gore said that listening to the forbidden W.A.S.P. albums over and over again had not turned him into a satanic dope fiend as his wife and her associates had warned. "It sucked because we always had to listen to garbage like Carly Simon and Lyle Lovett all the time," said Gore, who told reporters that he was "loving" being single again. "That stuff is lame, man. If it doesn't have big balls and bigger riffs, get it out of my stereo!" According to Gore, being deprived of artists like W.A.S.P., Mötley Crüe, and Ice Cube for so many years only made him more curious. The former presidential candidate claimed that finally hearing them all for the first time was "like having [his] brains shot into outer space." "I can't believe I wasted half my life helping Tipper put warning labels on this stuff when I could have been seeing these guys do their thing live," Gore said of W.A.S.P. "They used to whip raw meat at the audience. How bad-ass is that?" "Cause I'm burning, burning, burning up with fi-ire! " added Gore, screaming the lyrics to "Wild Child." According to Gore's personal assistant Eric Linscott, the Nobel Peace Prize winner has been spending most of each workday gorging himself on the songs "On Your Knees," "The Torture Never Stops," and "Show No Mercy." "I spent six hours at Best Buy yesterday trying to find these Quiet Riot and N.W.A. albums he was asking for," said Linscott, who claimed he also purchased a mirror etched with the AC/DC logo for Gore's home office. "Whenever I try to talk to him about upcoming meetings or something, he just makes this, like, devil symbol with his hands or starts air-drumming. I'm really hoping this is just a phase." Sources confirmed that Gore has also been catching up on movies that Tipper would not allow the 62-year-old to view because they contained violence, adult language, or nudity. He recently finished watching Purple Rain nearly 26 years after his wife forced him to turn it off because the song "Darling Nikki" contains references to masturbation. Gore also announced plans to stay up all night watching Porky's, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Red Dawn, and The Terminator. "Why would I need Tipper when I've got all this?" said Gore, gesturing toward stacks of compact discs, vinyl albums, VHS cassettes, DVDs, and Nintendo games. "I'll tell you one thing: If she thinks I miss her, then she's out of her mind, because I don't. I'm living the dream here, my friend. I'm not lonely at all." Added Gore, "Not lonely at all." In related news, family sources reported that Tipper Gore has been enjoying her newfound freedom by taking 20-minute showers and leaving the lights on all day.

'The Witcher' Producers Assure Gamers Netflix Series Will Include All 400 Side Quests From 'Wild Hunt'
Good news Witcher fans! After months of speculation over Netflix's upcoming production, and growing worry that major elements from the books and the Witcher games would be cut out of the show, producers have finally put those concerns to rest by assuring gamers that all 400 side quests from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will be in the series. Thank god fans are getting the complete adaptation they deserve! "We understand fans' worries about their favorite characters or quests from the Witcher games not making it into the show, but rest assured that viewers will be treated to hours of Henry Cavill killing drowners and helping villagers clear spirits from their farms," executive producer Sean Daniel told OGN. "You won't just see Yennefer and Dandelion, but also fan favorites like Hattori the Dumpling Swordsman and Niellen, the Blackbough hunter who lost his wife. "We also have a great 10-minute short that's just Geralt sitting in a chair at the Oxenfurt barber and deciding on a new hairstyle," he added. Witcher completionists are sure to be thrilled that the show's creators are dedicated to keeping intact the series' well-known regard for immersion and worldbuilding, including hours of footage where Geralt collects white myrtle and blowball and painstakingly crafts oils and potions in preparation for some killer fight scenes. With over 3,000 spoken roles and episodes that will run between several minutes and 20 hours, it's really everything a Witcher fan could hope for! "We didn't want to disappoint anyone who was expecting to see Geralt hunt down the full Ursine armor set or meet Egill the Druid, or see a sandcrab, which is why we've been filming for almost four years straight to pack it all in there," said Daniel. "Of course, it's a risk to include a two-hour scene of Geralt hunting a Grave Hag in silence or adding an entire midseason storyline where he collects every Gwent card. But we were committed to honoring every aspect of the source material, no matter how lengthy or seemingly unrelated to the main plot." Well we don't know about you, but after hearing this, the Witcher hype is clearly real! Now let's just hope the series honors it's promise to show full hardcore penetration in every one of the show's 40 sex scenes.

Netflix Adds Thousands Of Mediocre New Subscribers
LOS GATOS, CA — Expressing disappointment while paging through a list of recent additions to the streaming-video service, Netflix executive Bela Bajaria noted Wednesday that the site had been updated to include thousands of mediocre new subscribers. "It's nice to see some fresh options on here, but none of these people look very interesting at all," said Bajaria, staring vacantly as she browsed the thousands of dull and uninspiring users added to Netflix this month. "Ugh, I was hoping there would finally be some good ones available, but these new subscribers just look boring or, in some cases, flat-out stupid. I've been scrolling and scrolling, but nothing is jumping out at me. It's like, what's the point?" Bajaria went on to lament the fact that so many of her favorite subscribers weren't even on the site anymore.

14-Hour Labor Not Exactly Cakewalk For Baby Sticking Halfway Out Mother's Vagina Either
TULSA, OK — Describing the experience as "no fucking picnic," an as-yet-unnamed newborn protruding halfway out of his mother's vagina confirmed Thursday that the 14-hour labor experience had not exactly been a cakewalk for him, either. "Just so we're clear, this sucks for me, too. I would love to get someone to wipe the mucus out of my eyes. Or maybe some ice chips?" said the 7-pound, 4-ounce infant, who felt his cries for assistance had gone completely unnoticed by the nearby team of doctors working to improve conditions for his mother while he was jammed inside a hot, cramped birth canal all goddamn day. "If anything, this whole labor thing is way worse for me, because at least she gets to be pumped full of drugs and she isn't dangling face-first out of her mother's cervix. Let's just say, I can think of better ways to spend my day that don't include having the shape of my head changed by someone's reproductive tract. Unbelievable." At press time, the baby had rolled its newly opened eyes in disbelief for the first time ever upon overhearing his father tell his basically unconscious mother that she was doing "an amazing job."

Steven Spielberg Claims He Dislikes Black Actors To Get Out Of Cannes Jury Duty
CANNES, FRANCE — In a brazen attempt to avoid serving jury duty and missing work days, film director and head festival juror Steven Spielberg told the organizing committee of the 2013 Cannes Film Festival that he strongly dislikes black actors. "I feel compelled to report to you that I have a personal bias against black actors and actresses that would necessarily impair my ability to carry out judicial responsibilities at the Cannes International Film Festival with integrity, impartiality, and competence," Spielberg reportedly told Cannes officials, adding that he has always held these views and that he would therefore be a "poor choice" to judge films fairly over the next 12 days. "Since I do not wish my strong opinions on race to sway, obstruct, or in any way influence the jury's final verdict, I recommend that you replace me with an alternate, such as acclaimed director and producer Ron Howard, for instance." At press time, sources confirmed that skeptical officials had denied Spielberg's motion for recusal and the director had sullenly accepted his $40 daily stipend.

104-Year-Old Reveals Secret To Long Life Being Cursed By Witch To Wander Earth Eternally
KENNER, LA — Sharing the key factor that had the greatest impact on his durability, 104-year-old Wallace Skinner revealed Monday that the secret to long life was being cursed by a witch to eternally wander the Earth. "I do the crossword every morning, I have a glass of scotch with dinner every night, and in 1937, an enchantress damned me with wretched immortality," said Skinner, who credited his longevity to a chance encounter 81 years ago when he scolded and pushed an old beggar woman out of his way, only for her to reveal herself as a beautiful sorceress and punish his cruelty by casting a spell that allows him to age as normal but never die. "I do try to eat healthy, but most food turns to ash the instant it crosses my lips. I also walk a lot, but that's mostly to escape the ever-present torment of seeing generations of loved ones pass on to the next life while I'm trapped here in perpetuity." The cursed centenarian added that he has no regrets, but that if he could do it all over again, he probably would have been nicer to that witch.

New Parents Disgusted To Learn They Had Type Of Baby That Shits
SHERMAN OAKS, CA — Terrified that their greatest fear has become a disgusting reality, new parents Melanie and Abe Bloom confirmed Monday that their newborn son Levi is, in fact, the type of baby who shits. "We had hoped that Levi would have a recessive shitting gene, and when that turned out not to be the case, we thought perhaps his incessant shitting was a birth trauma thing that would subside after the first three weeks, but no matter what we do, he simply won't stop. It's horrible," said the infant's mother, adding that their son's virtual fecal hose runs at full volume regardless of whether he breastfeeds or takes formula, even when the child is just napping. "I guess I'm not completely surprised, considering we waited so long to have children, but for us, adapting to a baby who shits has been an ordeal. I'm told that plenty of people who shat constantly and uncontrollably as children have grown up to lead perfectly normal lives, but given where we're at right now, I don't know. Levi's father shits, too, so we assume that's where he gets it from, but I've made appointments with a number of pediatric specialists because this is just really gross." At press time, the couple was trying to conceive again in order to have a normal baby.

Equifax Impressed By Hackers' Ability To Ruin People's Finances More Efficiently Than Company Can
ATLANTA — In the wake of a massive data breach that exposed the sensitive personal information of 143 million customers, executives from credit agency Equifax said Friday that they were impressed by the hackers' ability to ruin people's finances much more efficiently than their company can. "We're truly amazed by the effectiveness and sheer speed with which the hackers wrecked so many Americans' financial prospects — it usually takes us years to devastate someone with a bad credit score," said awestruck Equifax CEO Richard Smith, noting that Equifax's traditional process of slowly chipping away at a customer's credit rating due to late payments on credit cards with arbitrarily raised interest rates or an inability to pay off subprime loans made them "practically a dinosaur" in comparison to cybercriminals who could wipe out someone's financial standing in mere minutes. "It's taken us a long time to get to the point where we can ensure that someone won't ever get approved for a loan, can't apply for a mortgage, or might not even qualify for basic car insurance, so it's honestly humbling to see these hackers do it in just a few keystrokes. But we're going to learn from this and use it to motivate us to sabotage people's finances much more efficiently in the future." At press time, Equifax announced it had laid off 80 percent of its workforce in favor of one Latvian hacker who could destroy millions of customers' credit ratings overnight.

Russian Interference Had No Impact On Election, Reports Website Created 8 Minutes Ago
WASHINGTON — Stating conclusively that the meddling was "negligible at best," TruthBeacon.org, an entirely new website created eight minutes ago, declared that Russian interference had no impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. "Experts have determined without a doubt that there is absolutely no truth to allegations that Russian interference, which was limited to a handful of barely viewed social media ads, influenced the outcome of last year's election," read the website that was reportedly registered last night and began rapidly publishing content for the very first time less than 10 minutes ago. "Also, all the investigations into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia have been unable to scrape together a single piece of evidence over the last year. Millions of taxpayer dollars wasted in what is decisively a witch hunt!" According to sources, TruthBeacon.org had crashed five minutes ago due to overwhelming traffic.

Man Losing Respect For Incompetent Boss Who Won't Fire Him
BOULDER, CO — Claiming that anyone with even a little bit of pride in their company would have dismissed such a terrible employee by now, telemarketer David Baker, 29, said Tuesday that he was losing respect for the "obviously incompetent" boss who continues not to fire him. "He called me into his office about a month ago. It was really the perfect time to tell me I should get a box and pack up my desk, but no, just another heartfelt inquiry into whether or not I'm feeling motivated. Disappointing," said Baker, maintaining that "any idiot" should be able to see that retaining someone like him was a complete drain on company resources, not to mention the negative impact on the coworkers who must listen to his malingering while they constantly pick up his slack. "Any respect or admiration I might have once felt for my boss is completely lost. I've never seen anyone so inept at their job, and, to be honest, I'm really concerned for the future of this company. I wish he were more like my last supervisor who took less than two weeks to recognize I had no idea what I was doing and fire me." When reached for further comment, Baker confirmed that he had been promoted.

'Becoming A Mother Has Been The Most Thrilling Experience Of My Life,' Reports Woman Fleeing Hospital With Stolen Baby
TULSA, OK — Pausing very briefly to reflect joyfully on her new role amid the day's flurry of activity, new parent Suzanne Knott declared "becoming a mother has been the most thrilling experience of my life" Friday while fleeing the hospital with the baby she abducted mere moments before. "The very first moment I held this tiny human in my arms, I knew my entire world had changed forever," said Knott, clutching the sleeping newborn close to her chest as she cut through the natal ICU to avoid pursuit, knocking over carts and incubators behind her to deter the nurses and security guards attempting to intercept her. "When her big, brown eyes met mine, I knew I would do anything for her, including knocking out her attending physician, stealing his coat, sneaking into the nursery, scooping her out of her crib, and running to the parking garage. I know, I know, everyone says motherhood changes a person, but until I finally clutched her close to my chest, I didn't realize how true it was. And now this little one's all mine." Knott has yet to decide on a name, but was strongly leaning towards "Autumn" after hiding overnight with her baby in a pile of leaves.

Report: Best Indicator Of Kickass Party Still Pizza Spinning On Turntable
PHOENIX — Based on a $3-million multi-decade study, a report released Wednesday by sociologists at Arizona State University found that the best indicator of a kickass party was still a pizza spinning on a turntable. "A stale, greasy pizza revolving on a turntable in place of a vinyl record remains the gold standard of what separates an average social gathering from an absolute fucking rager," said Dr. Isaiah Banks, adding that for a house party to qualify as "totally killer," it must include a 9-1 beer-to-person ratio, a mattress floating in a swimming pool, and at least three bras strewn across a chandelier. "Prior to the 1980s, the best indicators for a bangin' party were a guest wearing a lampshade on his head or opening the master bedroom door to see several people engaged in sexual intercourse. While today's kickass parties require a spinning pizza with the stylus riding along the coagulated cheese, there are other ways to gauge a bash, such as how many lightweight dweebs puke in the fish tank or whether or not the stoners ashed a joint into a loved one's urn." According to Banks, the number-one indicator of a lame party was still a drunk athlete jumping off the roof and becoming paralyzed.

Hope Hicks Praying She Not Still In Same Shitty Job By Time She Hits 30
WASHINGTON — Saying she only had two years left to find a "real career," White House Communications Director Hope Hicks was reportedly praying Friday that she wouldn't be in the same shitty job by the time she hit 30. "Overseeing President Trump's public relations strategy is fine for now as a placeholder, but if I'm still doing this in a couple years, that's gonna be really embarrassing," said Hicks, adding that while she was interested in working in journalism or maybe television production, she would certainly go to graduate school for business if the only alternative was "rotting away in this dead-end gig." "There are guys still here in their 40s, and they just seem so unhappy. I can't let that happen to me. I gotta get out of here if I ever want to make something of myself." Hicks went on to say she'd be surprised if her miserable boss didn't call it quits even before she did.

'Pokémon' Fans Are Up In Arms With Game Freak's Refusal To Include A National Sex Offender Registry In 'Sword and Shield'
In a huge blow for Pokémon devotees everywhere, Game Freak revealed this week that the upcoming Pokemon Sword and Shield will not include the National Sex Offender Registry that for so long has been a quintessential part of the game experience. Needless to say, fans are up in arms about losing the crucial ability to know exactly which Pokémon Center employees and Gym Leaders in the Galar Region have a serious past of indecent exposure, molestation, or soliciting child pornography. "One of my favorite parts of past games has always been starting out in my house and having a few locals knock on my door to inform me that they had committed Tier I offenses of sexual deviancy and reside at such-and-such address," said Minneapolis Pokémon fan Jessica Winesberg, one of thousands of fans who have voiced their outrage that the new release would also be stripped of iconic features such as the "Pedophile Free Zone" signs around in-game schools, libraries, and public parks. "Frankly, it's an insult to fans to strip out this feature. Plus, how else am I supposed to keep my trainer safe from these creeps if I don't have access to the Galar Sex Offender Registry? Every cave or forest I step into for a battle could have a potential pervert lying in wait." "Now, I'm just going to assume that any characters I meet in my quest might have run up to a playground full of children and flashed them," she added. While Game Freak has defended themselves by saying that the Switch wasn't up to the graphical demands of rendering every sexual deviant in the Pokédex, that hasn't stopped infuriated diehard fans from launching a social media campaign with the hashtag #PokéSexRegistry urging the developers to reconsider their choice. Clearly, gamers are not taking kindly to the developer's suggestion that tracking down the Sword and Shield's 150 perverts and weirdos throughout the world will be half the fun. Thankfully, no matter how much Game Freak changes in the game, they confirmed that series fans should stay clear of Sugar Cane Isle, a location where 13% of the game's serial offenders apparently live in a supportive Christian community aimed at rehabilitating those with a past of sexual degeneracy.

God Re-Floods Middle East
JERUSALEM — In what theological and meteorological authorities are calling "a wrathful display of Old Testament proportions," the Lord Almighty re-flooded the Middle East Tuesday, making good on last week's threat to wipe the region clean if there was not an immediate halt to the bloodshed between Arabs and Jews. The Lord made the decision to go ahead with His second Great Flood after last-ditch U.S.-Saudi peace initiatives were rejected Monday night. "The Lord thy God has warned you and warned you, but you have, in your hatred and selfishness, chosen to turn away from Him," read a press statement from God, delivered by seraphim and cherubim acting as His earthly agents. "Prepare now to face His wrath and be drowned beneath the cleansing waters of His righteous rage. Children of Israel and Palestine, you who would not repent your sinful ways and live together as God's children, prepare to face your doom under the unstoppable deluge of the Lord's retribution. As of press time, a torrential rain continues to fall on Israel and the West Bank, with the downpour expected to continue for another 39 days and 39 nights. Thus far, flood waters have risen more than 200 feet, drowning most of the humans and animals in the vicinity. The few remaining survivors, most of whom cling to pieces of driftwood, have made desperate pleas for mercy, but their cries have fallen on deaf ears in Heaven, with the Lord refusing to stem the raging waters. Though regretful over the severity of God's punishment, Mideast peace negotiators nonetheless praised Him for coming up with the first-ever viable solution to the ongoing crisis. "Yahweh, or Allah, depending on what name you choose to call Him, has finally brought to bear upon this place a direct route to peace," said former president Jimmy Carter, who in 1978 brokered the Camp David Accords, one of the region's many short-lived peace agreements. "Lord knows that I and many others before and since Camp David have done our best to find a way for these two peoples to stop the killing and hatred, to no avail. But God, in His infinite wisdom, realized that it just isn't worth it anymore, and that the best thing to do is cut His losses, drown the whole lot of them, and start fresh once the raging waters subside. In spite of repeated warnings from God, the flood came as a major surprise to Israeli and Palestinian leaders, who believed He would keep the promise He made following the Great Flood of Noah never to drown the planet again. Confident that God would honor the "Rainbow Covenant," Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat rejected the 11th-hour peace deal proposed by the joint U.S. and Saudi delegation. "I believe Arafat and Sharon thought the Lord was bluffing and wrongly assumed they could call His bluff rather than make peace with each other," said Timothy Uselmann, a professor at Harvard's Center For Middle Eastern Studies. "Evidently, they were wrong. God has sent a strong message here: Obey His commands, or face certain peril at His hand. Speaking on behalf of the Lord, an unnamed, non-denominational representative of Heaven said: "God only promised humanity that He would never again flood the entire Earth. He never said He wouldn't flood specific areas. The most recent, clearest sign of the Second Deluge came last Thursday, when a tersely worded press statement from God's angelic hosts ominously stated, "If there are any species native to the area that you would prefer not to see go extinct, we strongly suggest you begin gathering them two by two. In spite of this and other such warnings, Palestinian suicide bombings and the Israeli military's West Bank tank assault continued after God's April 21 cease-fire deadline passed. "For too long, thou hast ignored the entreaties of thy Lord to let go of your wickedness and hatred and live together in peace, My children," God said. "Thou hast refused the lion to lie down with the lamb, and My rod and staff have been of no comfort to you. Instead, you have continued to kill each other without ceasing. The time has come for that to stop. You want to keep running each other over with tanks and strapping dynamite to yourselves, killing women and children in pursuit of your extremist political positions, that's just fine. Let's see how well you carry out your murderous agendas under 800 feet of water.

Inconveniencing Others Makes Me Feel Alive
Every part of my body is tingling with excitement right now. I just got back from the supermarket. It was a crowded Saturday, and there was barely any room to move my cart. Suddenly, without warning, an urge rose up inside me. "No," I told myself, "I only came here to get a few things for dinner and go home. " But there was no use trying to fight it. Before I knew it, I was leaving my cart in the middle of the cereal aisle to check out the price of birthday candles two aisles over, and when I returned, people were backed up on either side of my abandoned cart, conducting an elaborate ballet, weaving in and out to make it past. Oh, sweet Mother Mary, what a rush! Nothing gets the blood pumping quite like making the daily interactions of those around me a little more frustrating. And once I start, I can't stop. Seeing the annoyed looks on their faces, it's like a drug, or an adrenaline rush, or — God, yes — standing still at the top of an escalator. When I got to the cashier, I decided that I'd had a change of heart on some items, so I had her deduct a canned ham and a box of frozen fish sticks. I could feel the eyes of every single person in line behind me as I dug through my pockets for the exact change. And when the print on the receipt came out too light, I made her change the ink roll, causing a three-minute delay while she dismantled the cash register. Just watching her sigh and rub her temples as she called her manager will be enough to get me through the week. I know it's wrong, but I just can't help myself. When I'm inconveniencing people, it's like I'm a newborn babe seeing the world for the first time. Everything seems better: the color of the green light I won't go through until five seconds after it's changed; the smell of the food I've sent back on a busy night because it wasn't prepared to my exact specifications, which I never bothered to voice to the waiter; the sound of my alarm going off every 10 minutes for two hours straight while my roommates are trying to sleep. It all becomes so vivid, so alive, and every loud, wheezy breath I take next to the coworker who shares my cubicle seems sweeter than the last. Why, even the simple act of buying coffee in the morning can bring the sound of bells to my ears. From the moment I step up to the counter with my headphones on, lost in my own little world, making the cashier ask three times if she can help me before I place my order for a half-caf skim latte with a shot of vanilla, but not too much vanilla like they did last time, and just one ice cube please, so it's not too hot — it's like a whole new day. But, oh man, I haven't even begun, because when she rings me up for my $2.85 coffee, you bet your sweet ass I'll try and pay with a credit card, which will invariably cause a long discussion about how they don't accept credit cards for purchases under $10. Then, I'll carefully but loudly explain to her that denying me use of my credit card is against the law. She'll rebuff me and I'll insist that I'm right, citing a number of pertinent laws and ordinances. She'll get her manager, who will have to stop what he's doing in order to escort me out of the store, but it won't matter. I'll already have gotten what I wanted. When they push me towards the exit, I'll loudly proclaim that I have never been treated so poorly in my life and vow never to return, only to savor the delicious look of revulsion and anger on their faces when I come back the very next day. That is, if I'm not up all night not RSVPing to the six weddings I'll nonetheless attend unannounced with a couple of friends. Every blessed second I spend walking slow and stopping abruptly on a busy sidewalk, getting into arguments with bus drivers, or tying my shoe in a doorway brings with it a sense of power. I find needlessly bothering those around me to be better than sex — even the loud sex I used to have in college while my roommate was trying to sleep only six feet away, pressing a pillow against the side of his head in a desperate attempt to block out the unnatural sounds of my animal rutting. But without a doubt, the very best, the most wondrous of all sensations is that spine- tingling jolt that grips the body when you begin telling a story no one wanted to hear in the first place, and then, just when it gets to the most important part.

Family Thought Grandfather Might Enjoy Watching Worst Little League Game Imaginable
BOWLING GREEN, KY — Saying it would be a great opportunity for some sunshine and fresh air, members of the Ostby family reportedly came to the conclusion Friday that their grandfather, Earl Ostby, might enjoy going outside and watching the worst Little League baseball game imaginable. "We just thought he'd get a kick out of seeing six innings of the most god-awful baseball ever played," said daughter-in-law Danielle Ostby, adding that the 83-year-old would probably love viewing a bunch of uncoordinated second-graders repeatedly fuck up routine throws to first base. "Grandpa doesn't get out of the nursing home very often, so we felt it would be nice for him to watch two completely shitty teams fail to hit a ball out of the infield and score zero runs. Plus, he finally gets a chance to see his grandson completely embarrass himself for an hour at shortstop." Ostby told reporters her children would also enjoy spending time with their unresponsive, decrepit grandfather.

Being Eaten Alive By Shark Not Nearly As Terrifying As Man Had Imagined
NANTUCKET, MA — Admitting that his expectations about a shark attack turned out to be pretty far off-base, vacationing swimmer Drew Roberts remarked Wednesday that being eaten alive by a 12-foot great white was not nearly as frightening as he once believed it would be. "This is something that's always paralyzed me with sheer terror, but now that I'm actually being eviscerated alive by rows of razor-sharp teeth, it's actually not that bad," said Roberts, who added that he had "made a mountain out of molehill" as he watched his viscera jet from his body into the surrounding surf. "I don't know how I got it into my head that being torn limb from limb would be so scary. Honestly, hearing my family screaming on the shore is the worst part." As several more ravenous sharks began to circle the gruesome remains of what used to be his torso, Roberts noted that his recent real-world experience had pretty much ruined Jaws for him.

POMPANO BEACH, FL — Moments after successfully sending her first text message from her new smartphone Tuesday, 75-year-old Eleanor Brodeson is said to have felt immense relief at the knowledge she had surmounted the final technological advancement of her lifetime.

"I just press 'send' and then I'm finished, right? That's it? Wonderful." At press time, Brodeson was locked out of her phone.

God To Leave Humanity In Hands Of Babysitter Kayla While He Checks Out New Restaurant
THE HEAVENS — Saying that He would only be gone for an hour or two, the Divine Creator of the Universe, God, announced Monday that he was leaving humanity in the hands of babysitter Kayla Beckler while he checks out a new restaurant. "Kayla has my number in case anything happens, but I'm sure she'll take good care of you while I'm out," said He Who Commanded the Light to Shine From The Darkness, stressing that the 17-year-old high school junior knew where to find snacks if humanity got hungry and would tuck them in at bedtime should He decide to stay out longer than expected for a nightcap. "It's so rare that I get to take a little break for myself, and I keep hearing great things about this little Peruvian place. All I'm asking is that you be good for Kayla. Don't start any fires or kill anyone while I'm gone, and if you get lonely, just know that I'll be back before you know it. Alright? Now give us kisses." The Lord also expressed hope that Kayla would help him avoid a repeat of last time, when he left humanity with St. Peter while he attended a performance of Oklahoma! and returned to find the Bosnian Genocide in full swing.

Guantanamo Bay Begins Construction On Senior Care Wing
GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA — Saying the expansion would ensure the facility is adequately prepared for upcoming challenges, officials at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp announced Wednesday that they had broken ground on a new geriatric care wing. "Our senior care center will be located immediately adjacent to Camp Delta and will contain all of the essentials our detainee population will need in the years ahead, including easy-access ramps from the confinement block to the exercise yard as well as wall-mounted grab bars and no-slip mats in the shower area," said Brigadier General Marion Garcia, who added that the facility's 116 beds and each of its various enhanced interrogation rooms would be located on the ground floor so that inmates will not have to go up or down any stairs when moving about, thereby avoiding unnecessary strains on their joints and helping to prevent falls. "We also plan to mount defibrillators throughout the corridors and in every solitary confinement cell, and make sure that our on-site clinic is stocked with ample stores of hypertension medicines and BPH treatments. As our detainees' needs change, so will our facility." Garcia added that the new space would be able to make use of a number of supplies already in the detention camp's possession, including its stock of feeding tubes and Ensure.

New Hobby To Tide Retired Man Over Until Death
WARNER ROBINS, GA — Saying that it should take up an adequate amount of the 67-year-old's remaining time on earth, sources confirmed Thursday that local retiree Ned McDowell has chosen gardening as the hobby to tide him over until his death. "Right now, I just have a couple of peonies and some Russian sage, but I'd like to expand the plot over time," said McDowell, referring to the activity that is expected to provide him just enough fulfillment and sense of purpose to get him through the approximately 18 years of his remaining existence. "It's actually not as easy as some people think — there's a lot to know about soil composition, and you really need to check up on the plants every day. But I really enjoy it, and hopefully this is something that I can keep up for a while." At press time, sources confirmed a neighborhood florist was answering McDowell's questions about the subject matter that will keep him occupied as his heart slowly works its way toward cardiac arrest.

Timeline Of Studies On The Effects Of Eating Meat
A recent study suggesting that regular red meat consumption has negligible effects countered growing consensus that eating red meat is bad for you, and gave rise to questions about why expert advice on meat consumption seems to change so often. The Onion takes a look at the history of studies about the effects of eating meat. Red meat consumption linked to survival. Popularity of John Harvey Kellogg's corn flakes moves nation away from beef and fish cereals. Upton Sinclair writes The Jungle to sway people toward buying his restaurant's new bean burgers. Physiologist Ancel Keys publishes a study finding Mediterranean diet is the healthiest, but even fucking Yugoslavian diet is better than what Americans eat. Landmark report from the research arm of the Smiths finds that meat is murder. Extreme Exaggeration Magazine finds that if you eat meat you will immediately die. Dietary patterns study links healthy eating to longer, hungrier life. Beyond Meat announces breakthrough imitation meat so authentic that it also gives you cancer. Reports suggest the McRib is back! Conventional wisdom will probably reverse again sometime around this year.

Dementia Study Reveals Fond Memories First To Go
BALTIMORE — Researchers at Johns Hopkins University published a new study this week on the cognitive effects of Alzheimer's disease and other deteriorative brain disorders, finding conclusive evidence that dementia sufferers' fondest memories are nearly always the first to go. The five-year study, which followed a group of nearly 3,000 individuals diagnosed with dementia, found that as neurons and dendritic connections in the cerebral cortex are degraded by the disease, patients' most positive recollections — such as falling in love for the first time or the overwhelming, indescribable joy of holding one's firstborn child just moments after their birth — are eradicated much more rapidly than other types of memories. "It appears that the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain, which underlies most forms of dementia, first affects the specific memory centers responsible for retaining the subject's most treasured reminiscences," said neurologist David Trapp, who noted that during the earliest stages of the disease, patients typically lose all recollection of their most prized personal and professional successes in life. "At acute risk are memories along the lines of the heart-stopping exhilaration of that first kiss at summer camp those many years ago, as the sun slowly set out over the lake and caught the water in just such a way, almost like the lake was on fire. In fact, that type of memory is erased almost immediately." "The moment you notice the first signs of dementia in a loved one, you can be certain that the majority of memories that give them any feeling of pleasure, pride, or personal fulfillment have already been forever expunged from their mind." "And memory loss progresses quickly from there," Trapp continued. "The moment you notice the first signs of dementia in a loved one, you can be certain that the majority of memories that give them any feeling of pleasure, pride, or personal fulfillment have already been forever expunged from their mind." Trapp added that the happier and more life-affirming a particular memory is, the faster it will be claimed by the neuropathology of dementia. Remembrances of proudly walking through the front door of one's newly purchased home or of triumphantly marching down the Champs-Élysées with the knowledge of having helped defeat the greatest evil the world has ever known are typically lost within a few weeks of being diagnosed with the condition. According to the study, brain regions associated with memories of love, smiling, accomplishment, unmitigated joy, comfort, interpersonal tenderness, physical pleasure, beloved childhood pets, and self-respect appeared to be the first targeted by memory-destroying neural plaques. "In fact, just the act of trying to recall the brightest days of one's youth — to recapture some small sense of the profound satisfaction that came from learning and discovering and experiencing new things, of the very essence of what is good about being alive — greatly accelerates the process," Trapp said. "We found that the more subjects attempted to think back to their carefree college years or their childhood escapades with friends over summer breaks, the faster these memories vanished, never to be recalled again." In addition to decimating those memories most important and sustaining to the patient, the degenerative effects of dementia seemed to spare the vast majority of the humiliating and unhappy moments from its victims' lives, the study found, leaving them fully intact as the remainder of one's store of memories steadily deteriorated and disappeared. "Even after subjects were robbed of their ability to recognize loved ones and the basic skills necessary to feed and clean themselves, the worst of their memories persisted," said Dr. Emily Braun, a neurobiologist at Columbia University who contributed to the study. "Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows that areas of the brain that retain, for example, the memory of walking in on one's oldest and most trusted friend engaged in passionate intercourse with one's wife or of suddenly being stricken with uncontrollable diarrhea while giving a presentation at a sales conference continue to light up well after the other cortical regions have gone silent." "And with complex emotional imprints, such as those stemming from a long relationship with one's spouse or children, it seems dementia selectively destroys neural circuitry related to the positive aspects of the memories in question, leaving behind only the trauma, pain, and disappointment related to these experiences," Braun added. "Although more research is necessary, it appears as though the most awful recollections actually become crisper and more vivid to the patient as the disease advances." As dementia reaches its terminal stages, Braun confirmed that bitter and displeasing recollections begin to erode as well, eventually leaving each individual with only a solitary, recursive synaptic pathway comprising their single most negative memory. This instance is said to be relived in a perpetual loop, to the exclusion of all other high-level cognitive functioning. "In their final months, it seems that dementia patients are left with just one exceedingly agonizing memory and nothing else," Braun said. "In their mind's eye, the very worst moment of their entire life is the last thing they'll ever see."

Philadelphia To Become DirecTV, PA After Cream Cheese Manufacturer Loses Naming Rights
DIRECTV, PA — Citing the rising cost of major metropolitan sponsorship, municipal officials announced Wednesday that, effective Nov. 1 of this year, the city once known as Philadelphia will now be called DirecTV, PA after the cream cheese company opted to discontinue its long-held naming rights to the city. "The name change will obviously take some getting used to, as well as significant signage changes we assume will be partially subsidized by our eponymous satellite broadcasting company, but we urge the citizens of DirecTV to welcome our new corporate partners," said DirectTV mayor Jim Kenney, reminding citizens that this was not the first time naming rights to the city have changed hands; prior to becoming Philadelphia in 1812, the city had been named American Fur Company, PA, a name it took on after 40 years of being known as Caswell–Massey, Family Purveyors Of Fine Soaps And Spices, PA. "Whether you're watching a DirecTV Eagles game, touring historic DirecTV City Hall, or enjoying a night out at the DirecTV Philharmonic Orchestra, this is still a wonderful place to share with friends and family. That's why it's called 'The NFL Sunday Ticket City Of Brotherly Love.'" City officials confirmed they have been congratulated by representatives of many cities around the globe, from Maruchan, Japan to Kars4Kids, NJ.

CG Supervisor For 'Cats' Thought He Actually Did An Okay Job
LOS ANGELES — Stunned into silence after reading through thousands of highly critical comments about the new film, James Darnell, the CG supervisor for Cats, spoke up quietly Thursday to note that he thought he actually did an okay job. "Honestly, I think the end result didn't turn out so bad at all," said Darnell, stressing that the widely panned sight of Taylor Swift, Jason Derulo, and James Corden as computer-generated cats singing and dancing through London alleyways represented three grueling years of his life. "For months, I stayed up late rendering textures to make sure the whiskers looked just right on the face of [Idris Elba's character] Macavity. That was hard, all right? And when I was finally finished, I was so proud that I showed my wife some of the concept art. Obviously, it's a silly little thing, but — I mean, Jesus Christ, this is my life these people are tearing apart. Have some fucking decency." At press time, Darnell speculated that maybe the problem had less to do with him and more to do with the fact that Americans have just gotten far crueler and more spiteful in the past few years.

Black Sheep Of Earnhardt Family Dies In Public Transit Crash
SAN FRANCISCO — Dr. Terrance Earnhardt, youngest son of the late NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt, died Friday when the light-rail Muni Metro train he was riding home from his oncology practice derailed, delivering one final embarrassment to the racing family. "It's a shame things had to come to this, but at least they finally have some closure and can stop worrying about him politely moving to the center of the vehicle so that other bus passengers have room to board," said longtime family friend Darrell Waltrip. "I know it tore Dale up inside, but after Terry confessed he didn't like competition or going fast and had a deep interest in alternative transportation solutions that reduced society's carbon footprint, they never spoke again. It was for the best. " The Earnhardt family is planning a private mourning lap Wednesday and has posthumously named Terrance the driver of the number 37 Quaker State Oil Additives Chevrolet.

No One In Prison Sure How Jared Fogle Still Eating Subway Every Meal
JEFFERSON COUNTY, CO — Expressing confusion as to how their fellow inmate was able to maintain a steady diet of oven-roasted chicken, classic tuna, and cold cut combo sandwiches, prisoners at the Englewood Federal Correctional Institution told reporters Monday that they weren't sure how Jared Fogle was still eating Subway for every meal. "The cafeteria doesn't offer Subway, and they don't sell it in the commissary, so we all have a lot of questions," said inmate Todd Kruger, noting that Fogle had received very few visitors, which ruled out the possibility that his friends were smuggling sandwiches into the facility for him. "I get back from lunch yesterday, and I see him in his cell, chowing down on a steak-and-cheese wrap with a Powerade and apple slices. I think I heard him mutter something about how they forgot the chipotle dressing, which makes it sound like he's ordering them from somewhere, but I honestly have no idea. Plus, the sandwiches always look like they've been freshly toasted, which just makes the whole thing even more baffling." Kruger added that he and his fellow prisoners were no closer to understanding why Fogle was the only inmate allowed to own an oversized jumpsuit that he could hold up to show how much weight he had lost.

Disney Announces 'Kingdom Hearts III' Will Feature Ernest, Turner, Hooch, And All The Rest Of Your Favorite Touchstone Pictures Characters
BURBANK, CA — Upon the release of the much-awaited third installment of the popular video game franchise, the Walt Disney Company announced Tuesday that Kingdom Hearts III would feature Ernest, Turner, Hooch, and all the rest of your favorite Touchstone Pictures characters. "In addition to incorporating elements from Disney and Square Enix properties, for the first time ever, a Kingdom Hearts title will also include hundreds of characters and multiple worlds from such Touchstone Classics as Sweet Home Alabama, Three Men And A Baby, and Kazaam," said Disney CEO Robert Iger of the role-playing game featuring an Air Force One-themed keyblade and a boss battle against Bob from What About Bob?, adding that, at one point, Sora, Donald, and Goofy fly their gummi ship to a Sister Act-themed dungeon where they team up with Sister Mary Clarence to fight Master Xehanort and his army of heartless. "We'd say 80 percent of the game is composed of Touchstone Pictures lands. Although our players have enjoyed joining forces with Cloud Strife or Mickey in the past, we felt that it was time for something new, and we're certain that they'll love dancing on the bar from Coyote Ugly or going on a shopping spree with Julia Roberts' character from Pretty Woman." Iger also revealed that the game would feature Stephen A. Smith, Holly Rowe, and several other prominent characters from ESPN franchises.

God Irritated Guests Do Not Understand It Time To Leave Heaven
THE HEAVENS — Growing increasingly annoyed at their clear ignorance of basic social cues, God, Our Heavenly Father, was reportedly irritated Thursday that His guests did not understand it was far past time for them to leave Heaven. "For fuck's sake, I didn't say they could stay forever — some of them have been here for centuries now," said the frustrated Almighty, who had long since ceased any attempts to entertain the guests and had instead begun to loudly do household chores throughout Heaven's blissful expanses, a hint that was completely lost on the millions of souls who remained casually reclined on their respective clouds or catching up with their deceased loved ones. "I'm always happy to let people crash for a few nights, but enough is enough. I have shit I need to get done. Plus, they're eating me out of house and home. I've tried every trick in the book to get them to split. I even told them I was taking a trip outside the universe for a while, but they were still here when I got back. I turned off the harp music a long time ago — it's like, come on, party's over." At press time, the fed-up Heavenly Father had finally worked up the courage to casually ask Mother Teresa about her plans for the rest of the day.

Putin Condemns Ukrainian People's Unprovoked 1,000-Year Occupation Of South Russia
MOSCOW — Condemning the actions of the Ukranians over the past millennium as "completely unacceptable by the standards of free and civilized people," Russian president Vladimir Putin condemned on Monday the unprovoked 1,000-year Ukrainian occupation of South Russia. "We will no longer stand for this inexcusable and unjustifiable display of naked hostility by the Ukrainians, who have baselessly claimed legitimate residence in the region since settling the area in the 10th century," said Putin, adding that the Ukrainian people's hawkish and belligerent decision to continue living in villages and cultivating the land would not go unpunished. "Russia cannot be expected to sit back and do nothing while our Black Sea ports are overrun by Ukrainians, as they have been for the better part of recorded history. Does history not demonstrate that millions of South Russian civilians have perished in the occupied region since Oleg of Novgorod first captured Kiev in 882? The Ukrainians must pay dearly for their deceitful and prolonged attack." Putin went on to demand that all Poles, Finns, and Lithuanians immediately withdraw from their regions of occupied Russia as well.

Russian Operative Disappointed Gerrymandering Taking All The Fun Out Of Hacking 2020 U.S. Election
SMOLENSK, RUSSIA — Lamenting that any interesting challenge in disrupting the vote has been completely removed from his job, Russian operative Pavel Artemyev reportedly expressed disappointment Friday that gerrymandering has taken all the fun out of hacking the 2020 election. "I really thought it would be a huge thrill trying to dismantle the U.S. democratic system, but it looks like all the work has already been done," said Artemyev, who claimed that any excitement he once had about diminishing Americans' faith in their democracy quickly disappeared upon the realization that elected U.S. officials had tirelessly toiled to suppress voters with discriminatory and partisan-rigged district maps. "I got into this because I wanted to make a difference, only to hack the Florida rolls and find out most of the African American voters have already been purged. It kind of sucks because there's no way my work could be as substantive as polling-place closures, malfunctioning equipment, and laws that allow election officials to reject ballots without standards or repercussions. I'm basically getting paid to do nothing." At press time, Artemyev had settled on creating and spreading false news stories about Sharia Law in the U.S. only to discover dozens of American publications already doing that as well.

Heaven Installs Spikes To Keep Cherubs From Shitting On St. Peter's Gate
THE HEAVENS — Frustrated by how frequently they've had to scrub the structure clean over the past several millennia, representatives from the Kingdom of Heaven confirmed Wednesday they had installed spikes atop St. Peter's Gate to prevent cherubs from shitting all over it. "It's really embarrassing — not to mention disgusting — that the first thing new souls see upon arriving here for the rest of eternity is our main entrance absolutely covered in cherub shit, so hopefully the new spikes will keep those little bastards away," said the archangel Raphael of the continuous strip of 7-inch interwoven stainless steel spikes that a team of contractors affixed along the top of the final threshold to everlasting paradise, noting that the divine beings' droppings not only sullied the appearance of the otherwise grand and gleaming gate, but also produced a noxious odor that posed a significant health hazard. "It was a bit expensive having them do the whole length of the archway, but much less expensive in the long run than paying someone to power-wash it every other week. Plus, it's a much more humane method than the poison pellets we were using before." At press time, Raphael had turned his attention to shooing away the haggard assortment of mangy, mostly flightless cherubs that hobble around on the clouds surrounding St. Peter's Gate, subsisting on scraps left by the crowds of the saved.

Heartbroken Russian Ambassador Thought Special Meetings With Jeff Sessions Were Very Memorable
WASHINGTON — Expressing surprise and sadness at Attorney General Jeff Sessions' repeated denials of contact with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, heartbroken Ambassador Sergey Kislyak told reporters Thursday that he thought his special meetings with the then–Alabama senator were actually very memorable. "To be honest, our two conversations hold great significance for me, and I can't help but be upset to learn that Jeff felt otherwise," said the tearful Russian diplomat, adding that he simply could not believe that Sessions could so nonchalantly dismiss the many hours they spent discussing the intimate details of their lives, including their innermost hopes and fears for their respective countries. "It really hurts to think that Jeff doesn't cherish the afternoons we spent sitting in his office exchanging information about everything under the sun. These were some of the most meaningful discussions of my life, and Jeff's writing them off like they didn't even happen. How could he be so cruel?" Kislyak went on to say that even his subsequent communications with former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn never for a moment made him forget the precious time he and Sessions spent together.

Jeff Sessions Spits In Face Of FBI Interrogator Trying To Get Him To Turn On Trump
WASHINGTON — Angrily dismissing offers of a plea deal if he would agree to cooperate with an investigation into the current administration's ties to Russia, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly spit in the face of an FBI interrogator Thursday who was attempting to convince him to turn on President Trump. "If you goddamn Feds want to know whether I'll turn rat: Here's my answer," said Sessions, shortly before leaning over the small wooden table separating him and his interrogator and spitting directly into the FBI official's eyes. "I'm not gonna crack, so you G-men can threaten me with whatever the hell you want — you're just wasting your time. I'll fucking die before I flip, so you got the balls to kill me?" At press time, Sessions had reportedly begun to break down and was frantically divulging everything he knew after agents asked him how long he thought he would last on the inside with all the people he had helped put away on marijuana charges over the years.

Price Of Gas Rises To Four Expletives Per Gallon
HOUSTON — Gasoline prices rose to a record-high four expletives per gallon Monday, a rate of fuel-price-related cursing not seen since the 1979 energy crisis sparked a nationwide obscenity boom. "Two years ago it seemed impossible that a gallon of gasoline would go as high as goddamn-shit-ass-balls," said commodities trader Philip Roan, adding that refined petroleum is up nearly 100 percent from cock-fuck last March. "Considering the unrest in the Middle East and growing global energy demands, fuel prices may well reach dick-ass-Christ-fuck-hell in as little as six months. " The unprecedented jump in swearing rates has reportedly prompted an increase in the number of Americans riding motherfucking bicycles.

What Compromising Information Does Russia Have On Donald Trump?
On Tuesday, it was reported that leaders of American intelligence agencies had given Donald Trump a memo advising that Russia had gathered compromising personal information about him as part of a wider effort to disrupt the election, though these claims remain unsubstantiated and both the president-elect and the Kremlin deny these reports. Here's a look at what damaging information Russia may have in its possession. Trump's sexual fetishes largely in line with those of an American president Holds significant financial investment in corrupt Trump Organization Scathing TripAdvisor review for Trump Hotel Toronto Eight years' worth of handwritten letters to Barack Obama praising his presidency and character Proof that he once had a business deal not turn out as lucratively as he expected Engaged in regular email correspondence with such dangerous far-right figures as Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions Trump was Russia's eighth pick for 2016 president Has been accused of sexual assault by over a dozen women, just in case everyone forgot Repeated disclosures that he loves Eric more than Donald Jr. A picture where his eyes are completely closed Though credited as executive producer of The Apprentice, Trump rarely liaised with production staff to strategize creative direction and approach Hired multiple prostitutes to hold him while he cried and talked about his father in a Moscow hotel room Horrifying list of alternatives he considered for cabinet positions Vast, tangled web of treasonous dealings that half the electorate won't give shit about

What You Need To Know About The Trump Administration's Ties To Russia
New revelations from the U.S. intelligence community about potentially illegal communications between members of the Trump administration and Russian officials, which led to Michael Flynn resigning as national security advisor Monday, have increased calls for a wider investigation of Trump's murky ties to Russia. Here's what you need to know. A: Violating the Logan Act, which states that American civilians must wait until after they take political office to commit treason. A: The humble general doesn't like to draw too much attention to his collusion with foreign governments. A: An outspoken advocate of intervention in the Middle East, Flynn is known to have a somewhat short memory. A: All evidence thus far suggests that Trump hasn't been cognizant of the world outside his head since at least 1993. A: We're talking about a completely different cozy relationship with Putin right now, okay? A: Psychologists believe that while sociopaths can seem friendly with one another, they're unable to form the type of bond required for meaningful relationships. A: No. A: Nothing a few news cycles can't bury. A: As a matter of professional decorum, they would never dream of impugning a sitting president.

GOP-Controlled Wisconsin Legislature Votes To Dissolve State Rather Than Let Democrats Have It
MADISON, WI — Passing the measure along party lines, the GOP-controlled Wisconsin legislature voted Tuesday to dissolve the 30th state admitted to the union rather than let governor-elect Tony Evers and other members of the Democratic Party have it. "This essential legislation officially dismantles the State of Wisconsin, thereby ensuring Democrats, who won every statewide executive office on the ballot last month, will have no legal authority within its borders," said Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, explaining that it would be reckless to honor the fair election of Democrats to the state's executive branch and far preferable for Wisconsin to cease existing and become instead a lawless wasteland of snow and ice. "While we cherish the past 170 years of statehood, there is simply too much at stake right now to allow the clear will of the people expressed at the polls to ruin Wisconsin by putting Democrats into positions such as governor and attorney general." At press time, the Republican-led legislature had passed a follow-up resolution naming outgoing Governor Scott Walker the Eternal God-King of the former state of Wisconsin.

We're Investing So Much In Alternative Fuels, Sometimes We Almost Forget To Pump Oil!
Ever since we changed our name from British Petroleum to BP (Beyond Petroleum) in 2000, we've led the way in developing progressive, environmentally friendly alternatives to gasoline. These last few years of pouring money into biofuels and renewable energy sources have been so great that I can't for the life of me remember why we used to drill for dirty old oil in the first place! What's that? You mean we're still pumping that stuff from hundreds of refineries all over the world? Well, I'll be. You know, I guess I've been so caught up in trying to make petroleum obsolete, I plumb forgot we're still in the business of selling fossil fuels. Oh sure, oil used to be a big thing with us from 1901 until after the new millennium, but these days I'm so busy with all the green-themed advertising campaigns and making a lasting commitment to our children's future — well, I just haven't thought about our worldwide system of oil fields in months! Funny how things just slip your mind when your multinational energy corporation vows to make obsolete the very product that brought it an unstoppable cash flow for over a century. Now, who wants to talk about how all school buses might someday run on vegetable oil? Hmm, I wonder if we still have that international chain of service stations filling SUVs with tank load after tank load of gasoline. Nah, I'm sure I would have heard about it, even though I'm pretty occupied lately thinking about how BP is solving tomorrow's problems today. I'm pretty sure all that "gas" stuff was phased out in the '90s right before we changed our logo to that sunflower shape and completely refocused our priorities from being the world's second-largest supplier of carbon energy to literally saving the planet single-handedly. Gosh, fossil fuels are just so not even on my radar at this point! Boy, you learn something new every day. Here I am, being environmentally conscious, thinking that we're pretty much done with the whole oil thing. My impression was that BP was more about solar now. I distinctly remember somebody saying that word: "solar." I can't remember the context, but it must've been one of those long meetings we're always having where nobody ever talks about gas. Wow. So why exactly are people still buying gas, when all the cars in the United States are powered by electric batteries by now? They're not? What?! You're pulling my leg, right? Surely we're not still relying on that dinosaur technology after all the effort we've put into alternative energy sources and forging an inoffensive corporate identity that reflects a new consciousness of global responsibility. Are we? Man alive! I'm going to write this down in my planner right now, so I don't forget to do it later when I'm all caught up in a discussion about wind power and how to maintain the delicate balance of our beautiful, precious ecosystem. "Still pumping oil, question mark. " Well, I'll look into it, if there's even anyone left in this multinational corporate headquarters who's still following that branch of the business. Wait — the price of oil is what? Over $4 a gallon? No way! Say, we must be making a fortune, huh? How the heck did that happen? Holy cow: Now that I'm looking over these annual revenue figures for the first time, I see that while I was doing all those other things, we made a couple hundred billion bucks! Geez, we're really raking it in! Who would've thought? I had no idea oil was still this profitable. I guess I'm a dope, because I would've thunk we'd run out of the stuff by now. Say what now? War? In Iraq? Over oil? Man oh man, international geopolitics sure is mired in the past. What's these guys' problem? Hasn't everyone heard we're totally beyond petroleum now? Whooee, what a crazy story this will make when I tell my environmentally committed board of directors. If I can get them to stop planting trees long enough to hear me, that is. Ha! Not likely! Who wants to take time away from helping preserve the world around us to listen to me rattle on about petroleum profits? Certainly not anyone at BP, that's for sure! Oh, look! I'm waist-deep in cash right now! I didn't even see all this money piling up around my desk. I guess I've just been so focused on developing cost-efficient, clean-burning hydrogen cells that I wasn't even paying attention. Quick, someone take these 40-pound sacks of cash to some guy in Berkeley studying carbon capture and storage. Three cheers for zero emissions! Hip, hip, hooray! Tony Hayward

Marine Biologists Train Highly Intelligent Octopus To Profitably Manage Mid-Size Aluminum Goods Supplier
HONOLULU — Noting that the cephalopod's natural problem-solving abilities had far surpassed their expectations, marine biologists at the University of Hawaii reported Friday that they had trained a highly intelligent octopus to profitably manage a mid-sized aluminum goods supplier. "We knew our subject had a high IQ, but we had no idea he'd be hitting such ambitious revenue targets in year one given the international commodities market," said lead researcher Maureen Kahale, adding that the octopus — known as Ziggy — had been observed administering payroll and tracking inventory across complex global supply chains. "Ziggy has proved himself incredibly adept at finding pain points throughout the customer journey and resolving them in ways that are 'value added' for both our company and our clients. He also possesses rare leadership qualities and acts as a mentor to everyone from the first-year analysts to the managing partners. In short, he makes this a fun place to work. Plus, he can type on eight computers at once." Noting the time, Kahale then asked reporters if she could be excused as she was already running late for a dinner Ziggy had organized to celebrate a big sale.

Premier League On Leicester City Title: 'Order Will Soon Be Restored'
LONDONーShortly after Leicester City's improbable title run culminated in the club clinching their first championship, executives from the Premier League issued a statement Sunday vowing that order will soon be restored. "We would like to inform fans of the Barclays Premier League that steps will be taken to ensure the traditional paradigms are reestablished in time for the 2016-2017 season," read the statement in part, which did not go on to offer any specifics regarding the measures it referenced, but did stress that a reversion to the league's long-held competitive hierarchy would be "swift and permanent." "This is an immediate priority that has our full commitment, and as such, we are willing to spend any and all requisite resources to guarantee a return to what is expected and acceptable. Until that is achieved, we will offer no further comment." Just hours after the statement's publication, the Premier League released the 2016-2017 season schedule, which reportedly indicated that Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester City will each play 38 home games.

Report: Underpaid Migrant Laborers Working 18 Hours Per Day On FIFA Legal Defense
ZURICH — Following a massive U.S. Department of Justice indictment alleging that high-ranking members of the global soccer organization conducted widespread financial fraud, sources confirmed Thursday that underpaid migrant laborers are currently working roughly 18 hours a day preparing FIFA's legal defense. "We have reason to believe that dozens of malnourished, impoverished workers are being exploited by FIFA for their labor as they attempt to build a defense strategy for charges including bribery, money laundering, and racketeering," said Human Rights Watch spokesperson Reed Brody, noting that the laborers, who originate from countries including Bangladesh, Thailand, and Senegal, have been reviewing financial records and filing subpoenas for hours on end in a fetid, dimly lit boiler room inside FIFA headquarters. "Some of those working to research relevant RICO cases are said to be as young as 14 years old, and we know of at least three cases of workers who died of exhaustion while preparing documents for pretrial motions. Of course, for all this grueling paralegal work, they are still only making a nominal 32 cents per hour." Brody added that human rights organizations are also investigating reports of a Nepalese man who disappeared the day after attempting to submit a guilty plea on behalf of an indicted FIFA official.

Google Now Giving Female Employees Free Day Each Week To Work On Lawsuits
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA — In an effort to keep its women employees fully engaged at their jobs, Google announced Friday the launch of a new company-wide program that would give all female staff members one free day each week to work on lawsuits. "All women at Google will have the option of working at the office in a dedicated lawsuit space or enjoying the flexibility to prepare their cases from the comfort of home with their own personal attorneys — we just want them to have as much freedom with this time as they want," said Google representative Kevin Mashburn, adding that the company welcomes collaborative class-action lawsuits from female employees as well as smaller "pet project" legal actions from single individuals that might one day grow into a multimillion-dollar settlement. "Giving our female employees the time and space to file documents, gather evidence, or just blue-sky the next big lawsuit is a hallmark of the Google approach. Of course, we value the contributions women at Google make at their everyday jobs, but we also want them to feel like they have the resources and opportunities to take that kernel of an idea for litigation and make it into a reality." Mashburn went on to say that Google was also giving the company's legal team one day a week to dream up any strategies that inspired them for crushing these women in court.

"Head northeast on Crawford Street toward Commerce Street," an automated voice reverberating from the car's sound system reportedly stated, causing the vehicle's windows to rattle as the driver nodded along with the thunderous instructions to drive half a mile and keep right at the fork. "Follow signs for U.S. 59 North. Use the middle lane to merge onto I-69/U.S. 59 North." At press time, onlookers reported hearing a deafening chorus of "make a U-turn" after the car appeared to drive down an unmarked side street.

Someone has a bad day. Crime scene sealed off to ensure no one but experienced experts can tamper with evidence. Camera put on "dead body" setting. Coroner empties out body bag he was keeping gym clothes in. Corpse's thumb used to unlock iPhone. Body taken apart if there are issues fitting it through a tight doorway. Guesswork. Six straight hours of identifying semen samples. Hard-drinking, existentially despairing detective listens to estranged wife's voicemail greeting but can't bring himself to leave message.

Nation's Nonfiction Writers Announce Plans To Keep Writing Down Things That Happened
WASHINGTON — Saying they were committed to objectively chronicling facts, information, and people, the nation's nonfiction writers announced Monday their plan to keep writing down things that have already happened. "We are dedicated to learning about actual stuff that has taken place in real life and then jotting that info down on paper so others can read it," said biographer Robert Caro, one of the millions of nonfiction writers, including essayists, journalists, critics, memoirists, technical writers, analysts, academics, scientists, historians, and documentarians, who will continue chronicling things that have occurred. "Sometimes, it's a personal experience we've had, or a historical event we think is cool, or just a bunch of neat facts about outer space that we write about. As long as it's not imaginary, Americans can count on us to take notes on it and then transcribe those notes into books or articles. If things stop happening, there's still tons of junk that have already happened for us to write about even if other people have already covered it." Caro also said that while the nation's nonfiction writers are devoted to recording lived experiences, they're all done writing about World War II.

Report Confirms That Being Unable To Keep Track Of Mass Shootings Technically Counts As Not Giving Attention To Shooters
CAMBRIDGE, MA — Stressing that it was by no means an ideal solution to the issue, a report released Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that an inability to keep track of all the nation's mass shootings still counts as denying shooters the attention they crave. "With the sheer number of massacres occurring across the United States, our failure to focus long on any individual attacker has, in its own way, prevented these killers from gaining notoriety," said comparative media scholar and report co-author William Uricchio, adding that the average citizen's capacity to remember discrete instances of mass murder reached a saturation point around 2013, and since then no single rampaging gunman stands out much from the others like him. "We've seen a remarkable decrease in the public awareness of a given shooter's name, his motives, and the ideology he subscribes to — as well as the fact that his attack took place at all. At this point, the vast majority of Americans can only recall the names of a couple dozen cities where the deadliest shootings have taken place. While this isn't exactly what was intended when critics argued we should stop giving a platform to perpetrators of large-scale gun violence, we nonetheless appear to be achieving this end." The report also noted that the readership of online manifestos penned by mass shooters has decline by more than 95% over the past decade.

Stephen King Stuck At Book Signing For Hours Writing Personalized Novels For Line Of Fans
PORTSMOUTH, NH — Expressing frustration as he spotted readers stretching out of the door at a local Barnes & Noble, bestselling author Stephen King was reportedly stuck at a book signing for hours Thursday writing personalized novels for fans. "God, every one of them seems to want me to write some little flourish to show their friends, whether it's naming the book's main character after them or coming up with some ghost that mirrors their personal demons," said King, arguing that it was no big deal penning one or two supernatural horror novels for die-hard fans at the reading, but after writing the first 50 or so fan's books, he would just zone out, focus on keeping his hand from cramping, and dash off the same boilerplate for everyone in line. "I got halfway through penning the last novel about a psychotic propeller boat, and the guy suddenly looks at me really expectantly and asks if I can put something in the book about his daughter. The worst is when they barely know my stuff and they bring me a James Patterson novel to write." King, however, admitted that he did get the idea for The Shining when writing a personalized novel for a fan named Jack Torrance during a 1974 book signing.

High School History Textbook Concludes With Little Blurb About Last 40 Years
EDISON, NJ — Immediately after dedicating 20 pages to the end of the Vietnam War and its aftermath, 11th-grade social studies textbook The American Vision awkwardly crammed the last 40 years of history into a little blurb titled "Into Our New Millennium." "They spent a whole chapter on Teddy Roosevelt alone, but now they're racing through the 1970s and just kind of stuffing Nixon's resignation, the energy crisis, and the Iranian hostage situation into bullet points," said student Russell Keener of the single-page spread, which somehow managed to encompass the attempted assassination of President Reagan, Rubik's cubes, the Tiananmen Square protests, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. "It felt like we spent forever on the cotton gin, but now we're just blazing through several decades like they're nothing. One moment it's the Lewinsky scandal, and the next we've got the first black president? It's especially jarring when the last page has two thumbnail pictures, one of the Twin Towers falling and the other of a computer with a caption saying 'The advent of the internet forever changed the way we see the world.' Huh?" At press time, students reported not being certain how to take the book's concluding sentence, which asked the question, "And who knows what will happen next?"

E.L. James Admits New Erotic Novel Originally 'Tiny Toons' Fan Fiction
LONDON — Shedding light on her creative process amid announcements of her forthcoming book, Fifty Shades trilogy author E.L. James conceded Thursday that her new erotic novel, The Mister, had begun as a piece of fanfiction about the '90s animated TV show Tiny Toon Adventures. "There was so much exciting chemistry between these characters on the screen that I just had to explore their sexual energy on the page, and while I may have changed their names for legal reasons, at their core they're still very much the Tiny Toons gang," said James of the novel that follows the erotic escapades of a group of college students — adapted from characters Babs Bunny, Buster Bunny, Hamton J. Pig, and others — as they navigate the depraved sexual fantasies of their professor at a school based on Acme Looniversity. "Believe it or not, the dashing Professor Dodd character from my book first took form as a taller, more humanoid, and sexually insatiable version of Gogo Dodo, who in the cartoon always struck me as this very carnal being. So the whole novel is really just an expansion on that." James went on to describe in detail an extended BDSM sequence inspired by the relationship between Sweetie Pie and Montana Max.

What To Know About The Recent 'UFO' Sightings
Over the past several years, U.S. military members are among those reporting sightings of unexplained flying objects, and while the subject has long been subject to much controversy and ridicule, more experts are acknowledging that something strange is going on. The Onion provides answers to questions about the recent UFO sightings. Q: Where are the majority of these UFOs being sighted? A: The sky. Q: Could they just be weather events? A: No. In every instance, all clouds were accounted for and in their assigned places. Q: Why the uptick in sightings? A: Economists suggest that aliens have more disposable income than ever and can afford to travel. Q: Is there any chance this is just instrument or pilot error? A: Yes, but only an extremely likely one. Q: Just how far up does this go? A: Careful. A person could get hurt asking questions like that. Q: Is it possible they were just military drones? A: An interesting theory, but the sightings were nowhere near any Afghani weddings. Q: How many series will the History Channel wring out of this? A: 17. Q: What should you do if you see a UFO? A: Authorities recommend posting a shaky, rambling 90-minute video to your YouTube channel to document the encounter. Q: Are we in any danger? A: Tons, but mostly just from climate change, war, pollution, and the other usual stuff.

Unclear Which Beach House Song This Is, Reports Lead Singer Of Beach House
OAKLAND, CA — Midway through her performance of a down-tempo number she described as "sort of pop-y and languid," Beach House lead vocalist Victoria Legrand reported Friday that it was not at all clear which Beach House song the band is currently playing before a sold-out crowd at the Fox Theater. "It has a lot of really heavy, atmospheric synth, and it definitely sounds familiar, but at this point I couldn't tell you its name or even which album it's from," said Legrand, who added that the song she has been singing for the past four minutes is probably about dreaming, but that she isn't certain because there's so much reverb on her voice that she can't understand any of the lyrics. "Don't get me wrong, I like this song — I just can't quite place it. Right now, I'm leaning toward either 'Troublemaker' or 'Lemon Glow.' Or wait, is this the one the Weeknd sampled? Hopefully it'll all be clear once we get to the chorus." At press time, sources confirmed Legrand was pretending to take a picture of the audience while frantically attempting to find the song on Shazam.

"The watch is a good start, but I need as many devices as possible to be directly in contact with my flesh, like lightweight tablets I can strap to my legs or some kind of Apple chestplate I can wear under my shirt," said 28-year-old Robert Klinman, echoing the sentiments of millions of Americans who said that any portion of their skin not in contact with an Apple product felt raw and exposed. "Maybe some kind of flexible Apple scarf, or even a full-body LCD sheet I could wrap my body in over and over, and that I'd never have to take off to sync up to my laptop. I mean, can you imagine anything more comforting than the warmth of your Apple pajamas as they gently charge through the night?" At press time, Apple consumers confirmed they would do their best with existing technology by wearing an Apple Watch and simply leaning their cheek against an iPad when they got lonely.

Local Brother-In-Law Heard You Can Make Shitload Of Money Doing That
BOULDER, CO — Insisting that this, right now, is the moment to get in on the ground floor if you want to "make bank," local brother-in-law Doug Mooreland recounted Monday to all available family members that he has, in fact, heard that one can make "a shitload of money" doing that. "I mean, even if you're only, like, halfway decent at it — and really, it doesn't seem that hard — you can make just a fuck ton of money. I heard one of the early guys who tried this thing, I mean, he worked pretty hard and it was the early days and all, but he retired at, I wanna say 40? And now he lives on his boat," said Mooreland, clarifying that the only things you need to get started are a reliable vehicle, some specialized equipment, and a bunch of friends. "You barely even have to work once you get it all rolling. Just sit back and collect what they call 'passive income.' I'm talking big money, man. So I've actually been thinking, it sounds like the real deal and, y'know, maybe you want to get in on this together?" At press time, Mooreland was also asking friends and family members if, long story short, he could sleep on their couch for a few nights, call it a week max.

Apple Fans Disappointed After Company Unveils Same Overpriced CEO That Barely Fucking Works
CUPERTINO, CA — Expressing fear that the Silicon Valley giant may be running out of ideas, the nation's Apple fans expressed disappointment Wednesday after the company once again unveiled the exact same overpriced CEO that barely fucking works. "I've come to expect a certain degree of innovation from Apple, but now they just trot out the same damn CEO every year, one that doesn't do anything new or different," said computer technician Adam Beverly, echoing the sentiment of millions of Apple devotees nationwide, who lamented that the chief executive has "really slowed down" over time and "looks more dated than ever." "They want me to consider this an upgrade when hardly anything has changed. He has all the same specifications as the 2012 model — same height, weight, and build — but somehow he costs more than ever before. It's frustrating to watch, 'cause I remember when they used to have the most cutting-edge CEO." Industry experts observed that Apple may have difficult times ahead if the company doesn't manage to come up with an innovative new CEO by next year.

The Only Way To Get Over Your Fear Of The Moon Is To Walk On It
It's okay to be afraid sometimes. It's a completely natural feeling that all of us experience. But we can't let fear dominate our lives. In my case, when it came to the one thing that scared me the most — that single fear that tormented me nearly every day — I knew the problem would only get worse unless I confronted it head-on. So, on July 21, 1969, I finally took the plunge. I conquered my fear of the moon once and for all by walking on it. And if you struggle with a paralyzing fear of Earth's only natural satellite like I used to, then I urge you to do the same: Propel yourself into lunar orbit, execute a controlled descent, and plant your boots in the moon's powdery soil. Otherwise, that fear will gnaw at you forever. Believe me, I know how helpless you might feel. Ever since I was little, I was terrified of the moon. For the first 35 years of my life, I couldn't even go outside on clear nights without breaking into a cold sweat. But then one day, I just had enough, and I said to myself, "Buzz, you can't keep on living this way." I knew deep down I had no choice but to land on the moon's surface, climb through that hatch, descend to the ground at one-sixth the gravity of Earth, and place my feet on the very thing that had always terrified me. Trust me, it definitely gets easier the more you bound around up there. Heck, by the time I got around to planting the American flag, I couldn't believe I'd ever been scared of the moon at all! You see, you can't let your fears get in the way of your life. No matter how tough you are, you're bound to be scared at some point or another, but you just need to find a way to face those fears, whether they're right in front of you or 238,900 miles away. Now, don't think you have to blast up to the moon and walk around on it all at once. Try easing into it by looking at pictures of the moon in a book. Or visit a science museum to see a moon rock up close — and, if you can, touch it — and realize that it can't hurt you. Once you're able to do that, you're ready for the real thing. The process of confronting your fear is actually easier than you think. Step one, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Step two, board a spacecraft that exits Earth's atmosphere, making one and a half orbits before initiating a third-stage trans-lunar injection burn. Step three, visualize yourself meeting your fear face-to-face. And lastly, step four is to set down on the lunar surface and get out there already! Also, if you're like me, it really helps to take those first steps on the moon with the aid of someone you trust. I asked my friend Neil to come along, and boy, was I glad I did! I remember him egressing from the Lunar Module and saying, "See, Buzz? Nothing to fear!" In that moment, I realized that if he could do it, maybe I could too. My knees were shaking as I climbed down that ladder, but then I actually set foot on the moon, that big, frightening disk in the sky that had made me cower in fear for so long! Sure, you might get a little nervous as you gingerly make contact with that gray alien landscape for the first time. But trust me, it definitely gets easier the more you bound around up there. Heck, by the time I got around to planting the American flag, I couldn't believe I'd ever been scared of the moon at all! But let me stress that no one's going to do it for you. A fear of the moon isn't one of those things you can simply think your way out of, or something that'll just magically disappear on its own. The bottom line is that eventually, you've got to buck up and strap on that Portable Life Support System, otherwise you'll spend your whole life just trying to avoid the moon entirely. And is that any way to live? So no more excuses. No more procrastinating. It doesn't matter how old you are, or how long you've been afraid of the moon — it's never too late to perform a final telemetry check, power on the navigation and guidance computer, and inform Houston that your LEM has landed. Because the longer you put off depressurizing that cabin and beginning your extravehicular activity, the longer you're cheating yourself of the carefree and confident lifestyle that comes with moving beyond your phobia of the moon. So, what do you say you rip the Band-Aid off and get up there to the Sea of Tranquility? You'll be glad you did. Because the last thing you want is to be like my poor buddy Michael Collins, who let his fear get the better of him and never left the Command Module, and who is, sadly, still petrified of the moon to this day. Buzz Aldrin

Paul Ryan Confident American People Will Warm Up To Tax Plan Once They Realize Life A Cruel And Meaningless Farce
WASHINGTON — Saying the current disapproval would soon give way to support, House Speaker Paul Ryan was confident Thursday that the American people will warm up to the new tax plan once they realize life is a cruel and meaningless farce. "Although it may not be very popular now, I'm certain that Americans will come around to this new system when they begin to understand the ruthless absurdity of existence," said Ryan, explaining that once taxpayers see that there is no objective moral framework in the unforgiving chaos of the universe, they will learn to appreciate what this bill actually does. "I think many voters will find a lot in this tax overhaul that they can embrace when it finally dawns on them that they have no agency and it's futile to resist entropy. We just need to keep hammering home to average folks that our time here on Earth is a joke with no punchline." At press time, Ryan said that once Americans accepted the brutality and pointlessness of life, they'd be just as amenable to gutting Medicare.

'Holy Shit, The Government Owes Me 50 Million Dollars,' Reports Man Incorrectly Filling Out His Taxes
CINCINNATI — Excited by the prospect of quitting his retail job and moving to his own South Pacific island, 28-year-old Ben Hughes learned Friday that he would be receiving $50 million in returns from the federal government after incorrectly filling out his taxes. "Wait, let me double-check this — yep, 50 million dollars, it's all right here," said Hughes, referring to a virtually illegible tax form on which he clearly entered his zip-code in the space intended for his number of dependents, deducted his social security number from his withholding, and had somehow managed to follow the tax reporting procedure for a major military contracting business. "Wow! I didn't think the benefits from the new tax laws kicked in until next year, but I guess this must be making up for all those years when I got nothing back at all." At press time, Hughes' enthusiasm was dampened somewhat upon finding that he actually owed the state of Ohio $17 million in property taxes.

'Cosmopolitan' Fires Editor After Learning She Lied On Resume About Having Sex
NEW YORK — Citing an investigation into the employee's work history and background, sources confirmed Tuesday that Cosmopolitan magazine fired their associate editor Alice Rowley after discovering that she lied on her résumé about having had sex. "On paper, we all thought Alice was a great fit for our publication; however, that turned out to be too good to be true when we discovered she had fabricated her sexual experience," said hiring manager Katie Erickson, adding that Rowley's glowing letters of recommendation from people she had allegedly slept with were exposed as fakes. "She ticked all of the boxes we were looking for in an associate editor, but we should have realized something wasn't right when Alice claimed to have graduated from the University of Iowa with a Bachelor of Sex degree. She also had a number of vague descriptions, such as 'working closely with an erect penis and the stuff that comes out the hole during vaginal intercourse.' I really doubt that she actually took on a strong leadership role during gangbangs. While we were initially thrilled to work with Alice, we could no longer in good conscience keep her on staff after finding out that she did not 'do it' 100 times in a night." Erickson admitted that the biggest red flag was in the special skills section of Rowley's résumé, which listed a proficiency in sexual positions that included both "doggy and cat style."

'Yeah, I Totally Wore These On The Moon,' Says Buzz Aldrin Selling Old Pair Of Gym Socks To Complete Sucker For $500,000
BREVARD COUNTY, FL — Trying to hold back laughter while explaining how the garments were knit out of "proprietary NASA materials that are specially optimized for zero gravity," Buzz Aldrin was reportedly selling a pair of old gym socks for $500,000 to a complete sucker Thursday, assuring him that he "totally" wore them on the moon. "Yeah, these rare, one-of-a-kind socks served me well while I was on the lunar surface," said the Apollo 11 astronaut to the verifiable chump, holding up a pair of white Hanes crew socks that he recently purchased in an $8 10-pack. "They may look a little dirty, but there was a ton of moon dust, which, in fact, adds to their incomparable value. Honestly, half a mil is an insane deal for these, but you gotta let me know soon since I have a bunch of people who are asking me about them." At press time, Aldrin told the pathetic sap that he could throw in a $20 Timex watch that he also "wore on the voyage" and make it a bundle deal for $750,000.

U.N. Secretary General Assumes Someone Already Doing Something About Uighur Internment Camps
NEW YORK — Speculating that there were probably dozens of people out there who had a handle on the situation, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres assumed Wednesday that someone was already doing something about the one million Uighur Muslims currently detained in Chinese internment camps in Xinjiang Province. "I presume there's a group of some sort that stepped up after seeing China imprisoning a million of their own Muslim citizens for religious reeducation," said Guterres, surmising that given the severity and scope of the situation, there were most likely several powerful world leaders and maybe even an international governing body dedicated to taking care of the whole thing before it escalated further. "Frankly, it would be weird if somebody didn't see a Muslim minority being rounded up without trial and immediately jump into action by signing some sort of accord. Or maybe the whole Uighur thing was already wrapped up — I haven't really looked into it recently. I mean, it started back in 2014, so there's been plenty of time. Either way, there's no chance in hell the world would just turn its back on a clearly oppressed people like this, right?" At press time, U.N. officials were reportedly delighted to hear China had already volunteered to sort out the issue themselves.

What's Inside Trump's Tax Returns
Donald Trump's aides have confirmed that the Republican presidential nominee will not release his tax returns despite numerous public calls for him to honor the expectation of transparency for presidential hopefuls. Here are some of the potentially damning contents that Trump prefers not to release to the public: Biggest source of income is a successful Dave & Buster's franchise in Paramus, NJ Tried to write off Eric Trump as a business expense Has a true calligrapher's hand Funnels all his money through a shady shell corporation called Trump Organization Could actually be getting bit more money back by just taking standard deduction Was granted a two-year exemption from 2011-2013 when he served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Malawi Failed to report $3.23 interest earned on Chase savings account Uses exact same tax havens as establishment politicians Is 39 years old $600 monthly reported income from Virginia Beach duplex rental Wrote off $350 million in apartment construction costs as charitable donation given the unimaginable luxury he was providing to tenants Miss Missouri valued at only $30,000 Still paying off top few floors of Trump Tower Used a number of underhanded tax maneuvers you have no chance of understanding

GOP Recommends Americans Set Aside Income From One Of Their Jobs To Pay For Healthcare Under New Bill
WASHINGTON — In an effort to address concerns about the affordability of coverage, Republican congressional officials advised Americans Monday to set aside the income from one of their jobs to pay for healthcare costs under the newly introduced American Health Care Act. "Under this bill, you would simply set up a separate savings account for the total earnings from one of your jobs, which will ensure that you can comfortably cover your healthcare expenses each month," said House Speaker Paul Ryan, adding that the GOP's proposed Affordable Care Act replacement would keep healthcare costs for the average American from exceeding the entire salary of one full-time job. "If you budget things correctly, you'll have plenty of money left over from your other job or jobs to spend on food, rent, and any other personal expenses. In some cases, healthcare will even be low-priced enough to afford using only the income from a part-time side job on the weekends. The important thing here is that this legislation will allow Americans — not the federal government — to decide for themselves what kind of healthcare they want and how many jobs they choose to have in order to pay for it." Ryan also recommended that in order to be prepared for the added costs of a sudden medical emergency, Americans should create a dedicated savings fund using the money from at least two of the mortgages on their homes.

Area Man Really Banking On Unconditional Love Doing Most Of Heavy Lifting For Mother's Day Bouquet
CHICAGO — After he picked up the first $14.99 floral arrangement he saw at his neighborhood drugstore Friday, sources confirmed local man Connor Wurster was apparently banking on unconditional love doing most of the heavy lifting for the bouquet he selected as a Mother's Day present. "This one looks decent enough, and it has a pretty good number of flowers," said the 29-year-old, who will reportedly rely upon the deep affection of the woman who gave birth to him to pick up the slack for the assortment of peach roses, stargazer lilies, and baby's breath he purchased with five minutes to spare before leaving to visit his parents for the weekend. "Plus, it comes with a vase. I don't know, maybe I should get some chocolates, too [in order to avoid having to depend so completely upon a mother's limitless and profound love for her child being truly eternal]." At press time, reports indicated Wurster had added a note saying "I love you so much" just to be safe.

Rubble Courts At Tennis's Syrian Open Present Unique Challenge For Players
GHOUTA, SYRIA — With its uneven, debris-strewn playing surface causing balls to bounce severely and unpredictably, players at this year's highly anticipated Syrian Open admitted Thursday that the tournament is a serious test for anyone unaccustomed to its notorious rubble courts. Unlike the perfectly manicured grass, clay, and hard courts at other tennis events, the annual tournament's heaps of concrete, ash, and mangled steel girders reportedly frustrate first-time competitors and veterans alike, leading to numerous early-round upsets and frequent in-match forfeitures due to lost limbs. "The Syrian is easily one of the most physically and mentally demanding events on the tour," said women's 4-seed Maria Sharapova, noting that it requires incredible effort and concentration to block out the pervasive rotting stench at Ghouta's All-Syria Club. "It can be infuriating having to run across twenty feet of shattered glass and mortar just to track down a routine drop shot, but, of course, your opponent is dealing with the same thing." "There are a lot of little adjustments you have to make while playing here," Sharapova continued. "The rubble just tends to favor flatter groundstrokes with less topspin, and all the dried blood out there pretty much renders your slice useless. It's a very tricky surface." Describing the jagged detritus around the net as a major obstacle for the serve-and-volley strategy, players told reporters that it often takes several days to become accustomed to the pained wails of distress and intermittent bursts of gunfire issuing from the Syrian Open's otherwise eerily quiet stands. "You certainly have to get into a rhythm, evading the live grenades and altering your kick serve so it lands in the service box without hitting any used artillery shells," said men's world No. 3 and three-time winner Roger Federer, noting that the tournament is notorious for frequently suspending play due to starved, terrified civilians running across the courts while attempting to flee the country. "The first time I played here, I was so distracted by the explosions and the distraught, crying mothers roaming the grounds, I didn't even make it out of the second round." According to those who have competed in previous years, the event gives a distinct advantage to more agile players who can easily dash around charred husks of destroyed vehicles while adjusting their footwork to avoid triggering the many active landmines littering the court. While some thrive in the slower, extremely cautious playing style of the rubble courts, the Syrian Open remains incredibly divisive among players. Many have reportedly complained in recent years about the tournament's strict policy of wearing all-white Kevlar vests during match-play, and several high-profile stars have also publicly demanded that officials install a retractable roof enclosure to shield against the many ballistic missiles landing in and around the courts. "People always talk about the difficult surface and the sarin gas hanging in the air, but I love it here," said defending champion Tomas Berdych, who won last year after all four quarterfinalists in the opposite half of the draw withdrew with shrapnel injuries. "The way I see it, you can either get annoyed at the tattered, sagging nets and decomposing human bodies, or you can embrace them." "Novak [Djokovic] is the real master on rubble," added Berdych. "He just has a knack for knowing exactly when to take cover from detonating pipe bombs, and it's amazing to watch him move so quickly across the smoldering ground and then fire a pinpoint forehand to within an inch of the severed body part he's aiming for. Beating him in the final after he was hit by crossfire between warring rebel groups was one of the highlights of my career." Though the Syrian Open offers very limited access to food and clean water, and has not featured a functional scoreboard since 2011, players said the event still attracts competitors from across the world seeking to prove themselves and take home the highly coveted silver car bomb. "Once you get past the fact that there's no security personnel, no clubhouse, and no safe shelter for miles, you settle into a groove," said women's top seed Li Na. "You can't let it get into your head when gangs of armed men keep kidnapping the ball boys or the chair umpire is blown away by a barrel bomb dropped from a helicopter — you just play through that stuff." "That's just the unique atmosphere of the Syrian," Li added. "It's become part of the tradition here." As with last year's event, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is expected to attend the men's final Sunday and will be seated with his wife in box seats just above the centre court mass graves.

Weeping Tim Cook Spotted Screaming For Help At Steve Jobs' Tombstone
PALO ALTO, CA — Eighteen months after the death of his mentor, Apple CEO Tim Cook was seen Wednesday pounding the tombstone of company founder Steve Jobs and begging for guidance in his leadership of what was once the largest corporation in the history of the world. "What the hell do I do? !" a hysterical Cook reportedly shrieked, clawing alternately at the grave marker and his own face. "You left no instructions, damn it. I need another game-changing breakthrough product that millions can't live without. Just give me one idea. One idea, for the love of God! Why are you torturing me like this?" At press time, sources confirmed that Cook had composed himself and decided to develop an iPhone 6.

Glitch In Country Allows Citizens To Temporarily Walk Through Tables
WASHINGTON — Saying that they were unable to explain the mysterious error, officials confirmed Friday that a glitch in the country was allowing U.S. citizens to temporarily walk through tables. "As many of you may have already noticed, due to a malfunction in the nation earlier today, citizens were momentarily able move through tables," said National Institute of Standards and Technology associate director Kent Rochford, assuring Americans that a team was working around the clock to locate and address the bug that enabled people to stride into and out of solid objects. "We apologize to anyone inconvenienced by falling through a counter or wall they were leaning against. Just know that we are doing everything in our power to patch whatever caused people to plummet through the floor into offices or apartments below." At press time, Rochford expressed hope that any further issues could be resolved by doing a hard restart on the country.

Interim Apple Chief Under Fire After Unveiling Grotesque New MacBook
CUPERTINO, CA — In his first major product release since stepping in for an ailing Steve Jobs last month, interim Apple CEO Tim Cook faced a storm of harsh criticism Monday after unveiling a grotesque new version of the company's popular MacBook that many in attendance described as "disgusting." Cook presented the bizarre, malformed new product to stunned silence during a media event at Apple headquarters, revealing a device that, while vaguely similar to a computer in certain respects, appeared to be encased in a thick, flesh-like coating that was visibly moist and engorged. "Oh, my sweet God," Apple employee Kurt Starfeldt said after viewing the MacBook up close. "It appeared to be discharging some sort of mucus-type substance from the headphone jack and making these weird murmuring sounds. And then it started quivering at one point when Tim was demonstrating how to use the touch pad. It was quite upsetting, actually." "I'm having trouble erasing the image of it from my mind," Starfeldt added. "Please make it go away." Shocked audience members claimed the appalling laptop, which seemed to many onlookers to have functioning digestive, muscular, and urinary systems, was "hard to look at" and easily the most repellent product yet manufactured by Apple. One customer, who had been anticipating the release of the new MacBook for months, claimed he felt "nauseous" when multiple software applications running at once caused the computer to start wheezing. "I tried to force-quit some of the programs, but it got all slow and began to turn this sickly purple color," Bill DeLain, 39, said. "Finally I hit the eject button and a tray popped open and spit out a bunch of teeth. Why does it have teeth?" According to technical specifications released by Apple, the revolutionary laptop also features an advanced graphic display with a movable lid that protects the exposed screen from harmful dust particles or bacterial infections that can cause the monitor to cloud up and ooze a yellow, milky substance. Available in 13-, 15-, and 17-inch models, each MacBook contains a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, a battery capable of lasting eight to nine hours on a single charge, and a full-sized keyboard orifice filled with rows of buttons made from growing keratin. Apple sources confirmed Cook was disappointed by the intense scrutiny from the media, stockholders, and consumers, believing that he was following in his predecessor's footsteps by attempting to push the technological envelope. "I watched Steve Jobs build the Apple brand from the ground up, and I know that the name of the game here is cutting-edge," Cook said. "Honestly, I felt like the next logical step would be a laptop that feels like an extension of your body. The design may not be perfect, but I'm hoping over time maybe people will learn to love it, just as it will learn to love them." Cook also assured consumers that the computer is fully compatible with the iLife suite of software applications. A group of users who tested beta versions of the horrendous new MacBook told reporters they were deeply disturbed when their products moaned to indicate a low battery and then snored gently when put to sleep. "There's all this gelatinous webbing that you have to stick your hand in just to turn it on, and then once you do, it starts, like, yelling for 30 seconds or so," said Shane Brick, a 38-year-old beta tester in San Francisco, adding that he "actually felt kind of bad for it." "The maintenance is ridiculous, too: Once a month it sheds all of its skin, and you need to shave the USB ports every couple days." "And you definitely cannot look at porn," Brick added. "The thing got really aroused." Brick also told reporters that his MacBook originally weighed five pounds, but ballooned up to 80 pounds during a two-week period when Brick was feeling depressed. He said eventually the computer began to quietly whimper, and tears streamed from the built-in speakers. As of press time, 3.2 million loyal customers were lining up overnight outside of Apple stores across the country for the chance to buy the slick new abomination.

Breitbart Criticized For Publishing Humanizing Profile Of Libtard Beta-Cuck
LOS ANGELES — Blasting the publication for its gentle treatment of the divisive figure, far-right news outlet Breitbart was criticized Thursday for publishing a humanizing profile of a libtard beta-cuck. "It's absolutely absurd that Breitbart of all places would think it was okay to portray this low-T liberal shill as a sympathetic figure," said Roy Hagar of Traverse City, MI, one of many readers expressing anger and confusion over the site's decision to treat the globalist SJW like he was just some regular everyday neo-Nazi. "Those blue-pill snowflakes already have enough of a bullhorn without Breitbart giving them even more media attention, and we can't start normalizing their behavior. Just because he goes to Olive Garden with his family doesn't mean that he's not actively promoting white genocide." At press time, Breitbart issued a retraction of the piece, explaining that it was never its intention to lend credence to the views of soy boys.

'Sometimes It Feels Like You're The Only One Who Understands Me,' Whispers Trump To White House Roach Infestation
WASHINGTON — Saying that its presence had been a valuable source of comfort at a difficult time, President Trump reportedly told the White House cockroach infestation on Friday that it alone truly understood him. "Things are so tough right now, and it's nice to know someone out there has so much in common with me, really gets what I'm feeling," said Trump to the skittering mass of insects that coated the walls, furniture, and floor of the Oval Office and feasted on a rotting hamburger in a wastepaper basket. "We just have a bond, and it gives me strength to know someone really accepts me as I am. Heck, sometimes I think you might even know me better than I know myself." At press time, an emotional Trump had scooped up a teeming armful of cockroaches to his chest for a long, tender hug.

'There Are No Good Options In Syria,' Sighs Man Who Has Devoted 12 Minutes Of Research To Topic
SAGINAW, MI — Shaking his head at the tragic futility of it all, local man Daniel Roth sighed "there are no good options in Syria" Thursday after devoting 12 minutes of casual research to the topic. "It's just so heartbreaking, but what's worse is that there doesn't seem to be any real solution," said Roth, who skimmed seven paragraphs of a Washington Post editorial on the subject and watched a short Vox explainer video on the various participants in the conflict before clicking over to the teaser trailer for Thor: Ragnarok. "There's certainly no silver bullet, and there might not even be a workable way out at all. With so many confounding variables at play, I can't even imagine a decent path forward unless something completely unexpected happens." Roth admitted, however, that he was not an expert on Syria and hoped his friend who recently read a 6,000-word essay in Harper's might have some more encouraging insight.

Poll: Majority Of Americans Approve Of Sending Congress To Syria
WASHINGTON — As President Obama continues to push for a plan of limited military intervention in Syria, a new poll of Americans has found that though the nation remains wary over the prospect of becoming involved in another Middle Eastern war, the vast majority of U.S. citizens strongly approve of sending Congress to Syria. The New York Times/CBS News poll showed that though just 1 in 4 Americans believe that the United States has a responsibility to intervene in the Syrian conflict, more than 90 percent of the public is convinced that putting all 535 representatives of the United States Congress on the ground in Syria — including Senate pro tempore Patrick Leahy, House Speaker John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and, in fact, all current members of the House and Senate — is the best course of action at this time. "I believe it is in the best interest of the United States, and the global community as a whole, to move forward with the deployment of all U.S. congressional leaders to Syria immediately," respondent Carol Abare, 50, said in the nationwide telephone survey, echoing the thoughts of an estimated 9 in 10 Americans who said they "strongly support" any plan of action that involves putting the U.S. House and Senate on the ground in the war-torn Middle Eastern state. "With violence intensifying every day, now is absolutely the right moment — the perfect moment, really — for the United States to send our legislators to the region." "In fact, my preference would have been for Congress to be deployed months ago," she added. Citing overwhelming support from the international community — including that of the Arab League, Turkey, and France, as well as Great Britain, Iraq, Iran, Russia, Japan, Mexico, China, and Canada, all of whom are reported to be unilaterally in favor of sending the U.S. Congress to Syria — the majority of survey respondents said they believe the United States should refocus its entire approach to Syria's civil war on the ground deployment of U.S. senators and representatives, regardless of whether the Assad regime used chemical weapons or not. In fact, 91 percent of those surveyed agreed that the active use of sarin gas attacks by the Syrian government would, if anything, only increase poll respondents' desire to send Congress to Syria. Public opinion was essentially unchanged when survey respondents were asked about a broader range of attacks, with more than 79 percent of Americans saying they would strongly support sending Congress to Syria in cases of bomb and missile attacks, 78 percent supporting intervention in cases of kidnappings and executions, and 75 percent saying representatives should be deployed in cases where government forces were found to have used torture. When asked if they believe that Sen. Rand Paul should be deployed to Syria, 100 percent of respondents said yes. "There's no doubt in my mind that sending Congress to Syria — or, at the very least, sending the major congressional leaders in both parties — is the correct course of action," survey respondent and Iraq war veteran Maj. Gen. John Mill said, noting that his opinion was informed by four tours of duty in which he saw dozens of close friends sustain physical as well as emotional injury and post-traumatic stress. "There is a clear solution to our problems staring us right in the face here, and we need to take action." "Sooner rather than later, too," Mill added. "This war isn't going to last forever."

John Kerry Costs U.S. Defense Industry $400 Billion
WASHINGTON — Responding to initial reports that Syria may relinquish its stockpile of chemical weapons following Secretary of State John Kerry's assertion that doing so would decrease the likelihood of American military strikes, representatives for the domestic defense industry complained to reporters Tuesday that the top-ranking diplomat may have cost them $400 billion in revenue. "We were ready to produce and sell tomahawk missiles, advanced combat systems, and more unmanned predator drones, but instead our Secretary of State had to run his big fat mouth about options for averting war, and now we're out hundreds of billions of dollars," said a visibly upset Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn A. Hewson, who along with her fellow executives at Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and General Dynamics complained that because the initial invasion would have more than likely led to a protracted, wide-ranging international conflict, Kerry might have even cost them trillions. "With thousands of new munitions and logistical support contracts, Syria would have been a goldmine for us. I swear to God, if this doesn't work out John Kerry owes us half a trillion dollars." Hewson added that it was some consolation that, with Kerry as the country's chief foreign affairs liaison, he would "probably say something idiotic" in the near future that would lead to another lucrative international conflict.

Syrian Man Kept Up All Night By Neighbors Dying
DAMASCUS — Expressing frustration with the constant clamor coming from nearby apartments, Syrian man Sayid Madanly was reportedly kept up all night Wednesday by the sounds of his neighbors dying. "God, I wasn't able to get any sleep because they're upstairs just moaning and screaming in the middle of the night," said Madanly, adding that the walls were so thin that he could clearly hear every shallow breath and cry of the couple next door as they reached the final throes of life. "It's so annoying. Just shut up and die already. It's one thing to loudly expire during the day, but after midnight, show some common courtesy for people who have to get up early for work. At least I've been respecting my neighbors by keeping my dying newborn quiet." At press time, Madanly was working up the courage to walk upstairs and put the neighbors out of their misery.

Rex Tillerson Shoots Mike Pompeo Quick Email Explaining All The Countries
WASHINGTON — Jotting down a few thoughts in order to help his replacement hit the ground running, departing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly shot Mike Pompeo a quick email Tuesday to help get him up to speed on all the countries. "Hey Mike, just wanted to give you a brief rundown on the nations of the Earth before I head out," read Tillerson's email, which then proceeded to list, in no particular order, the 206 countries of the world, along with brief, often one-word descriptions for each. "Mexico: Spanish-speaking nation on southern border that doesn't like walls; Australia: big island with kangaroos and no guns; China: communists, trading partner, we owe them lots of money; Nigeria: hot; Saudi Arabia: fantastic; South Korea: ???" Sources confirmed Tillerson concluded his email by saying there was no need to stress out about remembering everything on the list, as he hadn't found it necessary to know all that much about the countries and Pompeo probably wouldn't either.

NASA Celebrates 60th Anniversary Of Launching First Moon To Orbit Earth
WASHINGTON — Commemorating what is widely considered to be the greatest achievement of space exploration, NASA on Tuesday celebrated the 60th anniversary of the launching of the first moon to orbit Earth. "We may not consider the idea of a moon that orbits Earth to be that big of a deal today, but if you mentioned it just a few decades ago, people would think you were crazy," said NASA acting administrator Robert M. Lightfoot Jr., explaining that with the successful launch of the 7.36 x 1022 kg satellite into orbit, the United States effectively won the space race precipitated in the 1950s by the Soviet Union's launching of the first meteor. "It wasn't an easy journey — one of the models exploded on the launch pad and another burned up while it was exiting the atmosphere. But thanks to key technological developments such as the three-stage super heavy-lift launch vehicle and the innovative computer systems on board, we proved that no goal, no matter how impossible it might seem, is unattainable." Lightfoot went on to say that further advances would allow NASA to launch a second moon by 2040 and then another moon approximately every 10 years after that.

Trump Aides Go Into Crisis Mode After President's Errant Remarks Condemning White Supremacy
WASHINGTON — After President Trump openly denounced white supremacy Monday in an errant statement on the mass shootings in Dayton, OH and El Paso, TX, every aide in the West Wing reportedly went into damage-control mode, looking for ways to get him back on message. "Great, now we're going to be here all night figuring out a way to walk back this offhanded remark," said White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who expressed concern that with a single flippant comment, the president had blemished his administration's record of consistently siding with and empowering people who believe the United States belongs, first and foremost, to white people. "We've worked so hard to make sure he stays on message not only by directly voicing racist views, but by personally embodying bigotry — and now he goes off script and criticizes those exact things! We need to get some dog whistles out to the base immediately." At press time, reports confirmed the president had completely reversed course, tweeting out his thanks to the El Paso shooter for helping to repel invaders at the nation's southern border.

Total Weirdo Leading Bracket Pool After Picking Teams She Analyzed And Predicted Would Beat The Others
HAVERFORD, PA — Expressing concerns about her odd behavior over the past few weeks, coworkers of Sheila Gottman confirmed Wednesday that the "total weirdo" was leading their office's NCAA bracket pool after picking teams she analyzed and predicted would beat the others. "What kind of freak actually reads expert analysis instead of just picking whoever has the cooler mascot?" said graphic designer Mikey Riverol, adding that Gottman's colleagues were baffled by her eccentric obsession with "high-quality wins" and strength of schedule when she could have just gone with random underdogs like Buffalo and Wofford. "You're just supposed to pick schools that your friends and relatives went to, not actually look at the teams stats and style of play like a fucking lunactic. Maybe deranged stuff like watching games and judging talent is fun for her, but it kind of ruins it for everyone else." At press time, several of Gottman's coworkers were looking to flee an uncomfortable conversation with the nutjob after she came over to ask whether people thought Virginia or Duke had a better shot at making the finals.

Black Man At Walgreens Impressed By How Attentively Employees Tailing Him
PHILADELPHIA — Saying he would not have been able to shake the eagle-eyed clerks even if he had wanted to, local black man Mike Chambers confirmed Thursday he was pretty impressed by how attentively Walgreens employees were tailing him. "Usually when I'm in a store, the cashiers just watch me from a distance while pretending to stock an endcap display, but these guys are doing a top-notch job of hovering right behind me the whole time," said Chambers, 35, admitting that while he was greatly offended by the racial profiling, he couldn't help but marvel at the lengths to which the employees went to avoid letting him out of their sight as he perused toothpaste brands and selected a bottle of ibuprofen. "Every time I round an aisle, another person is right there, pointedly asking if they can help me find something. They're real pros here, really thorough. I can only assume it's because of their training." At press time, sources reported that Chambers had paid for his items and taken three steps toward the exit before the store manager stopped him and asked to examine his receipt.

Trump Confirms That It Was Iran Or Some Country Like That Behind Saudi Oil Attacks
WASHINGTON — Addressing the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia that took out more than half that nation's oil production capacity, President Trump told reporters Tuesday the precision-targeted bombings were a major act of aggression by Iran or some country like that. "The primary actor behind the strike on our Saudi allies was definitely Iran or one of those countries in that same part of the world — someplace with a lot of deserts, a lot of Muslims, a lot of guys with beards," Trump said to members of the White House press corps, adding, "Syria maybe? Jordan?" before his voice dropped off to an inaudible mumble. "The American people can trust we will take swift action against. ..Qatar? No, that's not it. We're pretty sure Saudi Arabia didn't do it, because why would they? Why would you bomb your own oil refineries? Then again, you never know. You never can tell. What do you guys think?" The president later clarified that the United States would bomb whichever country the Saudis paid it to bomb.

Ohio State Self-Reported Secondary Violations They Just Assume Currently Happening
COLUMBUS, OH — Admitting guilt for infractions that sound like the types of obscure recruiting rules the school would break, Ohio State's athletic director self-reported to the NCAA several secondary violations he just assumed were currently happening. "I don't have concrete evidence that these things are going on, but I figured at least a handful of these rules are being broken given our track record," said athletic director Gene Smith, who said he could not point to specific examples of wrongdoing, but assured reporters that at the very least he assumes his coaches are currently texting people they shouldn't. "More likely than not, we're also probably having former players in the NFL contact our kids because that just feels like stuff we like to do. I'm pretty comfortable filling out the paperwork to let the NCAA know something wrong is probably going on somewhere." At press time, the NCAA had released a statement saying they assumed they were already closely monitoring the university for some recruiting bullshit.

Third-Grader Clearly Biting Off More Than He Can Chew At Elementary School Book Fair
COLUMBUS, OH — Watching in disbelief as the youngster added another children's novel to his quickly growing stack, sources confirmed Thursday that local third-grader Hayden Schmidt was clearly biting off more than he could chew at his elementary school book fair. "This kid is in way over his head here — there's no way he's going to read something as long as Charlotte's Web," said eyewitness Marissa Chandler, scoffing and shaking her head as she noted that the 8-year-old already had a pretty full plate after selecting Mr. Popper's Penguins and Stuart Little. "Jesus Christ, now he's grabbing Bridge To Terabithia! That's way too advanced for him — he'll never make it past the second chapter. Who does he think he is?" At press time, sources confirmed the third-grader had finally come to his senses, placing the books back on the shelves in order to use his money on some cool pens.

FEMA Airdrops Emergency Cyanide Pills For Residents Stranded By Hurricane Florence
WILMINGTON, NC — In an effort to provide aid to those affected by the devastating weather event, FEMA representatives confirmed Monday the completion of their mission to airdrop emergency cyanide pills for residents stranded by Hurricane Florence. "We've spared no expense in making sure the residents of these areas are getting the best help available. If you're trapped in an area threatened by rising floodwaters, rest assured that your cyanide pills will be arriving as quickly as possible," said FEMA representative Roy Pelton, explaining that the decision to drop crates full of the lethal poison came after several less successful trial runs of delivering pallets loaded with nooses, razor blades, and guns containing single bullets. "These fast-acting 300-milligram pills have been thoroughly tested for their effectiveness at putting a swift end to all the pain and suffering associated with natural disasters, and we're doing everything we can to make sure they're being distributed to all the areas where they're needed most. We are proud to confirm they can be used by the entire family, including pets." Pelton admitted the agency learned to deliver the pills in a more timely manner after they arrived too late to mercy-kill the thousands of Puerto Ricans who had already died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.

Grayson Allen Recalls Struggle Growing Up Without Any Principles
GREENVILLE, SC — Recounting the difficult circumstances that shaped his development into adulthood, Duke University shooting guard Grayson Allen recalled Friday the struggle of growing up without any principles. "It was really tough not having any ethics, especially when all the other kids did," said a visibly distressed Allen, adding that it was always hard competing in basketball games when he was the only one on the team without any sense of right and wrong. "I've spent a lot of time thinking about how it's so unfair, but at some point I've just got to accept that I don't have principles, and I never will. As I've gotten older, I've realized that finding my way in the world without values was a blessing in disguise and made me into who I am as a person." At press time, Allen told reporters that he would feel much worse about his lack of moral principles if it weren't for coach Mike Krzyzewski's unwavering support.

Area Man Somehow Roped Into Arguing Passionately For Green Day
YOUNGSTOWN, OH — Though he admitted he hasn't listened to the band in 10 years, tech-support specialist Jonathan Meagher, 25, somehow found himself defending Green Day while slightly intoxicated at a local bar Saturday. "Some guy we were drinking with said the band was 'complete shit,' which, I mean, say what you want about Green Day, but 'complete shit' is a bit of an overstatement," Meagher said. "Then the guy said something about Limp Bizkit being better, and before I knew it, I'm pounding my fist on the bar and saying that Green Day might be the best band of our generation. Seriously, I don't even know the lead singer's name. Shortly after returning home from the bar, Meagher purchased the Green Day song "American Idiot" from iTunes, played the major-label debut album Dookie, and reported being amazed that the band hadn't really changed at all since 1994.

Pretty Decent 13th Birthday Party Taking Place At Week 3 Preseason Game
EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ — Excitedly watching the exhibition game in the half-empty stadium, local 13-year-old Josh McNeil reportedly had an overall pretty decent birthday party Saturday night at a Week 3 preseason NFL game between the New York Giants and the New York Jets. "I've never been to a game, and my dad said I could only take two of my friends, so Jeremy and Michael came with us, and we actually got to sit in one of the middle levels," said McNeil, adding that after moving down a few rows to a set of unoccupied seats, his father purchased the boys and McNeil's two sisters several baskets of chicken fingers to split as they watched the brief first-quarter appearances of Giants quarterback Eli Manning and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. "It was still cool watching a game in person even if it didn't count for anything. We had to leave during the third quarter because it was getting late and Jeremy had soccer practice in the morning. It was, you know…it was fun." Sources confirmed that McNeil's party was almost as good as his birthday two years ago when he and several friends attended an MLS game at Red Bull Arena.

Trump Disavows Supporters Who Could Barely Keep Racist Chant Going For 10 Seconds
WASHINGTON — Seeking to distance himself from supporters he claimed did not represent his message, President Donald Trump held a press conference Thursday to disavow rally attendees who could barely keep a racist chant of "send her back" going for ten seconds. "I was not happy with how quickly their chant petered out," said the President, stressing that those wishy-washy supporters who could only parrot back his xenophobic attacks for a few seconds before dying down should not be viewed as a reflection of his base as a whole. "You can see for yourself in the video that I quickly paused to give them room for the chant to grow louder and louder, and I was very disappointed that it never built to a fever pitch. If I had known they'd leave me hanging out to dry like this, I would have called off the event immediately." A notably contrite Trump added that, in the future, he would take action to ensure that all future rally appearances led to a crazed, rage-filled mob.

"The U.S. stands ready to address the threat of violent extremism, so if I could just get the name of a person or a group that I can supply with weapons to stop ISIS, I promise I'll get a whole big shipment to them ASAP — all I need is a name," said a visibly exasperated Obama, explaining that he had "tons of guns" he could send and vowing that he would "keep them right on coming" for as long as needed until the situation was resolved. "Automatic rifles, RPGs, mortars — we've got all of that. So if someone could please tell me the name of a city to drop them off in, or even a region will work, or, you know, just point to somewhere on a map, I swear I can get all those things there in a few hours. Seriously, just let me know." The president added that if he didn't get an answer soon, he would simply go ahead and airdrop a crate of M16s and ammunition every half mile or so across the greater Middle East and just hope for the best.

NCAA Tournament Really Disrupting Man's Ability To Get Any Fucking Around Done
CHICAGO — Calling the games a "complete time suck," 32-year-old junior sales associate Collin Hiller told reporters Friday that the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament has really been affecting his ability to get any fucking around done. "Normally I'd be busy doing jack shit at the office right now, but today I've been completely distracted from that by all these games," said Hiller, who had only intended for the tournament to serve as a brief break from aimlessly browsing YouTube, but instead spent the last three hours glued to the online broadcast at NCAA.com. "Christ, I'm so behind on checking out pictures of infinity pools, and there's still a ton of crap to read on Twitter I haven't even started yet. I want to catch the rest of this game, but I feel a little guilty not Gchatting with my girlfriend or just dicking around on my phone." At press time, Hiller had simply resigned himself to pulling another all-nighter doing dumb shit.

CHICAGO — Wearing a Tom Waddle jersey and armed with a pair of tongs, local NFL game day prepper Hank Pritchard reportedly stockpiled coolers of Bud Light and hundreds of pounds of grilled meats Friday in his underground bunker. "People call me paranoid and crazy for keeping a safe room stocked with burgers, beer, and all the fixins, but it's imperative to be prepared for any kind of game day emergency," said Pritchard, 60, showing off the underground bunker outfitted with six George Foreman grills, a chest freezer, 10 crock-pots, a 70-inch 4K TV, two smaller TVs for viewing games concurrently, a La-Z-Boy recliner, a meat smoker, and dozens of framed photographs of Soldier Field. "You never know what could happen when the game starts. People throw an extra pack of brats on the grill and think everything will be okay, but what if the Bears-Saints game goes into overtime? I have at least 500 hot dogs, 200 pounds of Velveeta, 40 bags of chips, and dozens of 30 bricks of light beer on hand at all times. People laugh, but we'll see who's laughing when the Super Bowl rolls around and my bunker is the only place around with five-alarm chili." At press time, an increasingly isolated and aggressive Pritchard confirmed plans to barricade himself in the bunker until the Bears are done for the season.

"I've been to some great stadiums in the past few years, but puking here was a really amazing experience," said Fernley, who praised the venue's large, well-placed LED screens that made it easy to follow to the action while doubled over vomiting from any direction. "I thought the new Giants' stadium was a pretty nice place to hurl, but I've never barfed all over cleaner, more modern bathrooms. Plus, there are tons of amazing bars and restaurants to pass out in. Viking fans are so lucky they get to puke here every home game." At press time, Fernley was praising the convenience of using the stadium's app to find a great hoagie that he could retch after the game.

Christie Describes ISIS As Grave, Towering, Meaty Threat To U.S. While Staring At Diner Patron's Corned Beef Sandwich
DURHAM, NH — Delivering an impassioned statement Friday during a campaign stop at Lou's Diner, Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie reportedly described the jihadist militant group ISIS as a "grave, towering, meaty threat" to the United States while staring intently at a customer's corned beef sandwich. "They are a violent, hateful, mouthwateringly delicious force that's stacked high throughout the Middle East," said Christie, licking his lips and promising the restaurant patron that the savage, savory extremists "wouldn't last 30 seconds" under his administration. "These salt-cured, thinly sliced, melt-in-your-mouth radicals want nothing more than to force the world to live under strict, melty Swiss cheese. Well, let me tell you: When I'm president, I won't stop until we get those thick-cut rye bread fundamentalists in our hands, squeeze them down, and finish off every last brutal, succulent morsel of that delectable menace, reducing their terror network to crumbs." At press time, Christie was explaining that to truly demolish the ruthless, juicy Islamic fundamentalists, he would seek to enlist the help of the Russian dressing.

FBI Shuts Down Prominent New ISIS Recruitment Website
WASHINGTON — Saying the measure would greatly aid efforts to combat the rise of anti-American sentiment online, the FBI announced Tuesday that it had shut down a prominent new ISIS recruitment website, www. whitehouse.gov. "Blocking sites like this one, which spread propaganda in the effort to attract people to ISIS, is vital to winning the war on terror," said spokesperson Terrence Moreland, adding that the FBI recently became aware of the site after prominent ISIS leaders began posting on social media in support of the online recruitment hub. "While it can be hard to keep up with the number of internet outlets posting Islamic extremist propaganda, ultimately sites like whitehouse. gov are the greatest resource ISIS has to incite terrorism against the U.S. Even though we finally managed to shut it down after a little more than a week, the site was so popular that there's no telling how many individuals have already been radicalized." Moreland went on to say that the FBI was also contacting Twitter to request the removal of several prominent accounts known to encourage ISIS recruitment, including @DHSgov, @POTUS, and @realDonaldTrump, but admitted there was only so much it could do to silence such a determined enemy.

Ralph Northam Admits He Once Engaged In Pedophilia As Part Of Michael Jackson Costume
RICHMOND, VA — Apologizing profusely for his youthful indiscretions, embattled Virginia governor Ralph Northam admitted Wednesday that he once engaged in pedophilia as part of a Michael Jackson costume. "I think it's important to put my actions into context — I was a huge Michael Jackson fan at the time and winning that contest was very important to me, so I learned the dance moves, wore the clothes, and molested kids," said Northam, adding that the thought of imitating the King of Pop without performing Michael Jackson's signature move had struck him as disingenuous. "It was all in good fun — and honestly, how many people would have recognized me as Michael Jackson if I wasn't committing acts of pedophilia? Virtually no one. Would I do it now? Of course not. I'd probably just go out and buy a chimp. Listen, I loved Michael Jackson, and I never meant to offend. It was supposed to be a tribute." At press time, Northam claimed that he would have come clean about the pedophilia sooner had he not been so strung out on powerful sedatives.

Conservative Floridian Enjoys Living Under Sharia Law More Than He Thought He Would
MACCLENNY, FL — Calling its clearly laid out regulations "surprisingly refreshing," conservative Floridian man Ernest Moyer told reporters Friday he enjoys living under Sharia Law much more than he thought he would. "I gotta admit, when I said 'Those damn Arabs are gonna ruin democracy' I didn't expect strictly abiding by the words of Muhammed would be so amazing for me," said the 63-year-old follower of Islam, who, despite once fearing "the rule of that Muslim Obama and his Saudi P.C. militia," now enjoys submitting his will to the Almighty during daily prayer, almsgiving, and his countless other fiqh rituals. "Sure, I miss drinking beer, but overall — thank Allah — I'm loving it. Praying towards Mecca is great, and eating Halal is pretty awesome if you know how to really prepare it. Plus, there's these great retributive penal orders like stoning, beheading, and amputating — and I'm not just saying that because apostasy is punishable by death." Moyer added that in a lot of ways, such as the law's hostility towards women, gays, and criminals, things have barely even changed.

Pharmaceutical Industry Reeling As More Moms Making Vaccines At Home
NEW YORK — A wave of concern reportedly spread through the pharmaceutical industry this week as several major drug companies reported a dip in quarterly earnings, with experts placing the blame largely on the growing trend of mothers choosing to make vaccines for their children at home. According to medical industry observers, the homemade inoculations, which are often assembled from scratch in kitchens or atop home craft tables, have become increasingly popular due to their low cost, their do-it-yourself appeal, and rising parental unease over the quality and origins of the ingredients in mass-produced immunizations. "With some simple mail-order biochemical compounds and a little bit of elbow grease, mothers can now make and administer their own vaccines in the comfort of their own homes, saving themselves the expense and hassle of visiting a pediatrician," said Deloitte senior business analyst Deborah Eisenson, who noted that the trend is spreading rapidly as more mothers post recipes and images of their handcrafted vaccines to Facebook and Pinterest. "In certain parts of the country, it has already become commonplace to see a continuous-flow centrifuge right there next to the microwave and the coffeemaker on the countertop." She added, "More and more of today's moms want to know exactly what's going into their children's bodies, so they're learning how to generate antigens from a home-grown chicken embryo or bacterial culture and then inject the vaccine into their child's arm or upper thigh tissue themselves." Sources confirmed that groups of mothers across the country confer daily in online forums to swap their favorite vaccine-production methods for pertussis, diphtheria, polio, and other viruses, often suggesting adding little touches to the suspending fluid — such as customized blends of chemical compounds and antibiotics — to make the vaccine their own. In blog posts, moms reportedly share tips on ingredient-sourcing, dosages, and how to keep inactive viruses from going bad in the fridge, as well as how to make vaccinations fun by getting their kids involved in the process of making them. When interviewed, many mothers described quality time spent gathered around the kitchen table, with the whole family helping to grind recombinant proteins with mortars and pestles while a supervising adult helps purify the mixture through chromatography and ultrafiltration. Others reportedly do prep work ahead of time on Sundays so that during the week they can simply come home from work, stir in any necessary adjuvants or stabilizers, and have an inoculation ready to go. In addition, YouTube has become a popular resource for mothers, who log on by the thousands to watch step-by-step instructional videos on everything from isolating the latest influenza strains to making their oral typhoid solutions more palatable by stirring in a little apple juice. One popular video, titled "Debbie's Own Quick & Easy Mueller-Miller casamino acid medium," currently has more than 23 million views. "I know my vaccines are better for my kid because I make them with love and care in my own kitchen," said Colorado Springs, CO mother Jen LaRochelle, adding that "God only knows what" drug companies are putting into their products. "When that immunizing serum flows through my daughter Samantha's veins, I want to know she's getting everything she needs. Making it yourself may take a little longer, but you get the hang of it pretty quick. A little aluminum hydroxide, a little ammonium sulfate, some polysorbate 80, and boom, it's done in no time." "So far I've made my own tetanus and meningitis shots, and I'm working on an HPV one right now," she continued, boasting that her all-natural injectables produce just as strong an immunity as the kind you get at the doctor's office. "I get to grow the cultures myself using my favorite artisanal yeasts. It's great." According to sources, homespun vaccinations are only one part of a larger do-it-yourself parenting movement in which moms and dads are producing handmade pills to treat hyperactivity, assembling their own orthodontics such as braces and retainers, and cooking up batches of insulin at home for children with diabetes. Experts predict that in years to come, the trend will only grow in popularity. "Enough people were complimenting my measles vaccine that I now make a couple extra vials on purpose," said Theresa Berman, a Fresno, CA mother of two, who revealed that her "secret ingredient" is a pinch of ginger. "It may not be as flashy as MMRV ProQuad, but it has the exact same WI-38 human diploid lung fibroblasts and MRC-5 cells as the brand-name variety." "Plus I print out my own cute little labels for the syringes," she added. "Moms love it."

Bill Belichick Drops Off Recent Draft Picks In Middle Of Nowhere, Tells Them To Find Way Back
UNNAMED DESERT — After providing his 2010 draft picks with only two canteens of water, a flashlight, and a cheap compass, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick dumped his 12 newest players in the middle of a desert wasteland Tuesday and told them to find their way back to Foxboro on their own. Belichick, who has always initiated new Patriots with this same survival ordeal, refused to give the dazed and disoriented football players even the slightest hint as to their exact location. However, the infamously Machiavellian coach told his draft picks that there was no potable surface water for "hundreds of miles"; that it would be in their best interests not to attempt to contact any locals who crossed their path; that only the fruit at the very center of the thornbushes would be edible; that most of the indigenous wildlife, especially the arachnids, was very, very poisonous; and that one of the things he had just told them was a lie. "Show me what you got, boys," Belichick said to the group from the backseat of a spotless black Range Rover. "If you want to be on this team, I'll see you in four days. And if you've been paying attention at all, you'll know exactly what to do. Oh, you can take your blindfolds off now. "By the way, Devin [McCourty]? I'd check that flashlight you're holding to see if it has any batteries. I might have forgotten to put them in," Belichick continued. "Not that a little thing like that should stop you. See Wes [Welker], here, the man with the honor of being my chauffeur? This resourceful bastard actually beat me home, so it's not like it can't be done. "Now don't let that desert sun get to you, boys. It can play some pretty crazy tricks on the mind," he added. "Okay, Wes, let's get out of here. After Belichick gave the confused group a small handgun loaded with a single bullet "just in cases someone wants the easy way out," the luxury SUV drove off, sending sand and dust flying into the players' eyes. Devin McCourty, Rob Gronkowski, Brandon Spikes, Taylor Price, Aaron Hernandez, Zoltan Mesko, Ted Larsen, Thomas Welch, Brandon Deaderick, Kade Weston, and Zac Robinson have been traversing the barren wasteland now for three days, walking over 60-foot sand dunes and braving the arid conditions while 35-mph winds whip sand into their unprotected eyes. Second-round pick Jermaine Cunningham, a promising outside linebacker, died Thursday of sunstroke. "I think [Belichick] drugged us," McCourty, the former Rutgers cornerback, said. "We were all at his home for that welcoming dinner, and the next thing I knew I was blindfolded, going in and out of consciousness. I know at one point we were in a plane, because I heard a captain's announcement. When I tried to take my blindfold off I'm pretty sure Tedy Bruschi hit me across the face with a Super Bowl trophy. That's how I lost these teeth, I think. "I don't think we're in America," said 62nd overall pick Brandon Spikes, tilting a canteen upside down in a failed attempt to get one last drop of water. "I've never seen lizards that size in America. [Kade] Weston never had a chance. Although the group of draft picks thought they were making progress Thursday, they were demoralized when they came upon footprints they determined to be their own — an indicator that they had been walking in a circle for the last day and a half. The players were further dispirited when they discovered a Patriots-hat-wearing skeleton buried just beneath the sand that turned out to be the remains of 2009 New England draft pick Rich Ohrnberger. "Ohrnberger was a big guy, man," former Ohio wide receiver Taylor Price said. "He carried a lot of water in that big body, and he didn't make it. What chance does a skill-position player like me have? We're lost. Jesus Christ, Welch, you got us lost. "We're all gonna die," he added. The players again thought they were on the right track when they found a backpack containing kindling material, 12 cans of refried beans, and a note from Belichick saying, "Enjoy!" However, after nearly eating the beans, former Oklahoma State quarterback Zac Robinson dumped them all out on the ground and kicked sand over them. "You idiots, they're probably poisonous," Robinson said. "Or maybe they aren't poisonous, and he just wants us to think they're poisonous. Either way, this man is insane. He's trying to fuck with us. This is a game to him. Everything's a game to him. Can't you see? This is all one big fucking game! As of press time, eight of the 12 draft picks remained alive. Although they have largely stuck together, the group has steadily fractured. With dehydration and hysteria setting in, Thomas Welch severely beat and nearly killed Zoltan Mesko with the butt end of the flashlight for eating the last sand cake, and Rob Gronkowski was muttering that he would murder anyone who even thought about stealing his "precious, precious diamonds. "Look at them," said Belichick, cool and comfortable in an impeccable white safari suit, watching from a dune several hundred yards away with team owner Robert Kraft and quarterback Tom Brady. "For God's sake, none of those beans were poisonous…. I don't think any of them are worth a damn. Let's just leave.

Osama Bin Laden Killed While Sitting On Toilet, Nation Likes To Imagine
NEW YORK — Osama bin Laden, 54-year-old leader of the international terrorist group al-Qaeda and mastermind of the 9/11 attacks that took nearly 3,000 American lives in 2001, was killed early Monday morning in Pakistan while sitting on the toilet, the U.S. populace took great pleasure in imagining today. "Just thinking about the stupid look on that evil bastard's face when those Navy SEALs kicked in the bathroom door and started blasting away — it's so totally priceless," said Queens, NY resident Rachel Sumner, one of 311 million Americans who reveled in a fictional scenario in which bin Laden met his gruesome and humiliating end while sitting on the commode, humming to himself, and reading a newspaper. "And him frantically trying to pull up his boxer shorts seconds before some badass Special Forces guy blows his head off — ha, ha! What a fucking moron." Some Americans have disputed this fabricated version of bin Laden's death, explaining they prefer to imagine the terrorist leader being surprised by Navy SEALs while wearing bright red lipstick, trying on ladies' clothing, sashaying in front of a full-length mirror, and saying, "Who's the prettiest little girl? Osama's the prettiest little girl!"

Buyer Of $450 Million Da Vinci Painting Sort Of Assumed It Would Come With Frame
NEW YORK — Saying auctioneers at Christie's had not been totally forthright, the undisclosed buyer of $450 million Da Vinci painting Salvator Mundi told reporters Thursday that the purchase was made under the assumption that the work would come with its frame. "I just kind of figured when I shelled out close to half a billion dollars for the Old Master's painting that the frame would be included," said the anonymous buyer, admitting that the gold-stenciled frame that displayed the Renaissance painting at least partially accounted for the record-breaking bid. "When I decided to purchase the painting, it seemed obvious that I'd be getting the complete package. But after the auction, they just handed me this painted wood panel with nothing around it. What a ripoff." At press time, the buyer was perusing Target for a frame with the right dimensions to fit the 500-year-old work.

Report: It's Not Okay To Just Start Talking To People You Don't Know
STANFORD, CA — Citing how devastatingly uncomfortable it makes people feel, a new report released by the Stanford University Sociology Department revealed Wednesday that it's never okay to just start talking to someone you don't know. The report, which analyzed numerous conversations that took place over a nine-month period from September of last year through May, states that approaching a complete and total stranger and saying "Beautiful day," "That's nice, where did you get that?" or "Hello" is, under no circumstance, acceptable. In fact, the study confirmed that in 0 percent of cases do individuals ever want to be spoken to by someone they don't know, and that it is "downright wrong" to put people who are just going about their day in the awkward position of having to be polite and feign interest in what you — an unknown intruder, essentially — are saying. "We found that the only people it's appropriate to talk to are friends and relatives — no one else," the study's lead author, Dr. Simon Gamble, told reporters, adding that dads, senior citizens, and "people who think they're being friendly but really need to just mind their own business" are typically guilty of trying to relate to unfamiliar people. "Ninety-five percent of the time, the people being talked to experience an extreme spike in anxiety. The only thoughts going through their heads during these unwanted conversations with strangers are 'Stop talking to me. I don't know you. Please go away.' "If you feel the urge to talk to someone you don't know, the right thing to do is suppress the impulse and just leave that individual alone," he continued, adding that cordially smiling at someone you've never met is also not okay. "It doesn't matter if you both happen to be wearing the same T-shirt." The report indicates that even in situations in which you might share common circumstances with a stranger — such as when you are both in a long line that doesn't seem to be moving, or are both experiencing hot, cold, nice, or terrible weather — it is unacceptable to verbally acknowledge that reality. The appropriate thing to do, the report notes, is to face forward and keep silent. In addition, just because you are sitting next to someone you don't know on a bus or airplane, that doesn't give you any right to talk to that person, even if he or she is reading a book you once read. The study goes on to state that talking to an unfamiliar person in a setting where the individual essentially can't escape the conversation is "one of the cruelest things one human being can do to another human being." "Often, the person being talked to will laugh at the other's jokes," Gamble said. "This is always fake laughter." The study confirmed the following people never want to be spoken to by a stranger: people eating at the same restaurant as you; someone who is wearing a pair of shoes or a hat you like; individuals who are also waiting for the same delayed train; coworkers; a man or woman who is using a laptop you are considering buying for yourself; an individual attending the same sporting event as you; a young person who works at a job you once had years ago; and anyone who has children or pets, especially if you are a person who also has children or pets. "If you are an outgoing individual who likes striking up conversations with strangers, you are a source of constant discomfort in this world, and have nothing to offer but anxiety and pain," said Dr. Andrea Malcolm, chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University. "People don't care that you once owned the same car or cellular phone as them, or that you loved it. They don't care about your opinion one way or the other. They just want you to stop making their lives a living hell." "To them," Malcolm continued, "you might as well be a crazy person, because why are you talking to someone you don't even know?" According to the report, the people who are living correctly are those who don't want to step outside their comfort zones and relate to others. "Your comfort zone is there for a reason," Gamble said. "It's so you can stay comfortable. If someone breaches that by saying hello to you, that person is the asshole, not you. Remember that."

Fourth-Grader Drawing Big Blank On Which Year 9/11 Terror Attacks Occurred
GALLATIN, TN — Furrowing his brow and nervously swinging his legs beneath his desk during his end-of-unit American History test, Sycamore Elementary fourth-grader Todd Ackerman reportedly found himself drawing a complete blank Monday on which year the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred. "I know it begins with a two, and I remember it was near 'Barack Obama becomes president' on our study timeline, but was it 2005? 2007?" said Ackerman under his breath, squinting down at his fill-in-the-blank test and firmly pressing his small fist against his forehead as he tried to recall whether the largest terrorist attack in American history happened before or after the Iraq War. "Think, think, think. It's got to be 2011, right? Yeah, that sounds right." At press time, Ackerman was on his third attempt to spell the name "Hurricane Katrina."

Encouraging Report From Radical Extremist Think Tank Finds America No Safer Since 9/11
WASHINGTON — Highlighting the gaping security holes that continue to persist 15 years after the attacks, an encouraging report released Thursday by radical extremist think tank the Caliphate Institute determined that the United States is no safer than it was before 9/11. "Despite efforts to expand digital surveillance and coordinate information-sharing among intelligence agencies, we discovered that the ability of the U.S. government to assess and eliminate potential terrorist threats has not substantively improved since September 11, 2001, which came as a shocking and welcome finding," said Selim Amir, chairman of the fundamentalist K Street research institute, which is staffed by prominent jihadist thinkers, visiting Sharia law scholars, and retired senior members of al-Qaeda. "We had believed that reforms put into place after the 9/11 Commission Report would have addressed slow emergency response times and provided law enforcement agencies with critical resources. But thankfully, we found just the opposite, and it appears America is as vulnerable as ever to a major attack. Considering how unsafe the U.S. remains, we highly recommend that policymakers do not take bold or comprehensive action whatsoever." The report follows on the heels of another encouraging Caliphate Institute study that lauded the U.S. drone program for its highly effective and sustained creation of terrorists.

Report: More Americans Relying On Grandparents To Help Fuck Up Their Kids
BALTIMORE — According to a study released Wednesday by sociologists at Johns Hopkins University, an increasing number of parents across the country are relying on their own mothers and fathers to help them fuck up their children. "As economic concerns prompt more parents to work longer hours, many are turning to grandparents to assist them in crushing their children's self-esteem and shaping them into confused, maladjusted adults," said lead author Dr. Janine Thompkins, who noted that four in 10 grandparents are currently the family's primary insult-givers to children. "Parents like knowing that while they're at work, a trusted family member is satisfactorily filling in for them by shouting at their kids in line at the pharmacy or criticizing their weight in front of their friends. And we found that, in most cases, children emerge just as fucked up and traumatized from a grandparent's constant belittlement as compared to that from their own mother or father." Researchers noted that many cash-strapped families are receiving added relief from subsidized child care programs, which allow parents to drop off young children at local community centers to be fucked up by underpaid, uninterested daycare workers.

Study: Child Obesity Rates Declining, But You Wouldn't Know It Looking At MacArthur Center Mall In Norfolk, Virginia
NORFOLK, VA — A report issued Tuesday by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reveals a significant decline in childhood obesity rates in several states, though, honestly, sources confirmed, you sure wouldn't know it if you took one look at the MacArthur Center mall in Norfolk, Virginia. "After decades of rising obesity rates among American children aged 2 to 4, our latest findings show that the prevalence of this alarming trend may at last be diminishing, despite what even the briefest glance at the MacArthur Center mall might lead you to believe," said CDC director Thomas Frieden, adding that the study, while statistically accurate, "sure as shit" doesn't seem like it if you've ever watched dozens of preschoolers frantically waddle to the food court of the Norfolk shopping center. "Though it's too early to conclude that we have turned the corner in stemming this dangerous epidemic, we hopefully will see further promising developments in the coming years, the grotesque little butterballs in the MacArthur Mall notwithstanding." According to agency sources, the CDC's latest report comes on the heels of similarly optimistic studies concerning the nationwide abatement of drug abuse, teen pregnancy, and illiteracy, which sure as hell weren't written by anybody who's ever visited the Ridgeland, Mississippi Dairy Queen.

9/11 Truther Vows Not To Rest Until Everyone Knows He An Asshole
MANCHESTER, NH — Claiming that the evidence is in plain sight for those who want to see it, local man and passionate 9/11 Truth movement supporter Victor Sidwell, 32, told reporters Wednesday that he will not rest until everyone knows that he is a complete asshole. The zealous Truther, who for more than 10 years has reportedly labored to shed light on the fact that he is an obnoxious blowhard seemingly incapable of keeping his fucking mouth shut, vowed to continue lecturing acquaintances, confronting strangers, and handing out pamphlets on the street in an effort to convince as many people as possible that he's an absolute and utter prick. "Ever since the so-called terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, I've only had one goal in mind: making people realize that I'm a piece of shit," said Sidwell while posting a lengthy list of inconsistencies in the 9/11 Commission Report on a friend's Facebook timeline. "If you take even a cursory look at the available information, it becomes glaringly obvious that I'm an abrasive jackass who routinely drowns out anyone unfortunate enough to get locked into a discussion with me." "The proof is right there," he continued. "I'm a repugnant, grating fuck, and I won't stop until every single person knows it." Sidwell has reportedly gone to great lengths to publicize his position as an insufferable loudmouth by diverting every one of his conversations toward the melting point of structural steel, repeatedly calling in to talk radio shows to express his controversial beliefs as to what "really happened" on Flight 93, and placing "What Did Cheney Know?" stickers in bathrooms of numerous local businesses. Speaking with reporters, the staunch proponent of the "controlled demolition" 9/11 conspiracy theory conceded that it is not always easy making those around him recognize that he is an unapologetic bastard who needs to shut the fuck up and get a life. Sidwell affirmed that, in spite of the challenges, he remains determined to "give a wake-up call" regarding his supreme dickishness to everyone he meets by forcibly engaging them in debates in office break rooms, personal residences, bars, internet message boards, and grocery store checkout lines. According to the Truther, most of the public remains "trapped inside a bubble" in which they ignorantly perceive him as a rational, well-adjusted member of society. However, he claimed he is making notable progress in convincing more and more of them of the "cold, hard reality" every time he loudly interrupts a friend's conversation in order to voice his suspicions concerning the whereabouts of the hijacked airliners' missing black boxes. "Even though it's clear that I'm an irritating dipshit, it sometimes takes people a while before they're willing to take off the blinders and come to their senses," said Sidwell, who on a regular basis forwards lengthy chain emails containing unsourced accounts of missiles striking the Pentagon to everyone in his address book. "But when you look at the objective facts, a clear picture begins to emerge: I have a compulsive need to engage in arguments in order to assert my intellectual superiority. I am in love with the sound of my own voice. I am not a good person." "The more I reach out to others, the more apparent all of that becomes," Sidwell added. Having spent years disrupting city council meetings and leaving inflammatory comments on every single YouTube video he watches regardless of its content, sources predicted that it would not be long before Sidwell succeeded in his longtime goal of proving to the world that he is indeed a first-class shitheel. In fact, numerous sources close to Sidwell acknowledged that he has already succeeded in alerting them to the accuracy of his endless, obsessive claims that he is a jerkoff, with many of these individuals telling reporters that they now wonder how they could have ever doubted him. "For the longest time, I thought Victor was a levelheaded individual whom you could stand to be around without wanting to tear your hair out, but eventually he was able to snap me out of my stupor," said Sidwell's cousin Emily Hardin, noting that she at last became convinced of the Truther's detestable nature in the middle of his 40-minute diatribe on the potentially doctored wreckage photos of 7 World Trade Center at their last family Thanksgiving. "At first, I was skeptical that he was an asshole, but now I believe. His tendency to seek out confrontations, his inability to talk about anything except 9/11, his refusal to let anyone else get a word in edgewise — it all adds up." "He opened my eyes to what should have been clear from the start," she added.

Date Of Apple Backlash Set For March 21, 2008
NEW YORK — In the face of Apple, Inc.'s 3- billionth iTunes sale and soaring stock price, some Wall Street forecasters are predicting that consumers will finally get fed up with the computer manufacturer's high retail prices and various product bugs sometime between March 20 and 22 of next year. "At the current rate, we believe that at this time a sea change will occur in which people will look down at their glossy white or black devices and feel a sense of embarrassment and gullibility," Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Shore said. "They will realize that, despite all the sleek design, they got caught up in a wave of hype that made them shell out additional hundreds of dollars for options and features they didn't need. Until then, I would like to point out that my iPhone is awesome. Apple has responded to the backlash rumors by announcing the late-October release of a mint green iPod in time for the holiday shopping season, a strategy that appears to have silenced naysayers at least temporarily.

Florida Passes Strict Ban On Being Unarmed
TALLAHASSEE, FL — In the aftermath of three deaths in a Jacksonville incident that represented the state's 22nd mass shooting in 2018 alone, Florida officials announced Monday that they had passed a strict ban on being unarmed. "It is abundantly clear that something must be done to stop gun violence in Florida, which is why we've made it illegal for residents to not be carrying a firearm at all times," said Governor Rick Scott in a press conference surrounded by armed legislators where he signed the bipartisan SB 5012, known as the Packing Heat Act, into law. "This ban on unarmed citizens is the strictest in the nation, showing Florida's unwavering commitment to combating gun violence. The Packing Heat Act imposes tough age restrictions prohibiting anyone under the age of 10 from not toting at least one firearm no smaller than .380 caliber at all times. Additionally, this law designates many densely populated areas, such as the downtowns of major cities, school campuses, and medical facilities, as special open-fire zones. Those found in unlawful non-possession of a firearm will be subject to up to 30 years in prison." At press time, governors of several states, including Texas, Louisiana, and South Carolina, announced that they were exploring legislation imposing similar bans on being unarmed.

This The Fuck Harness Sex Shop Worker Has At Home
PHILADELPHIA — Calling Euphornica the only model he trusts with his raw-dogging needs, Pleasure Cove employee Jason Kempner told customers Rick Cantor and Jennifer Wilson Thursday that this, here, is the fuck harness he has at home. "This bad boy is the best one we've got. Sure, it costs a little more than the Commando, but you couldn't ask for a more durable fuck harness or a better long-term investment — I've had one in my bedroom for a decade and it hasn't cinched my balls or ass hairs once," said Kempner, adding that the sex swing was easy to mount, stain resistant, and the model that he personally recommends to friends and gifts to family members for Christmas. "Those straps are really high-quality, no chaffing at all. I got a ton of mileage out of this one and it can hold 400 pounds for sure. Trust me, I set my brother-in-law up with this puppy just last week and he's constantly raving about it." At press time, Kempner had convinced the couple to take sex swing for a quick test fuck.

Bill Belichick Forgets About Loss By Relaxing In Bathtub Filled With Warm Entrails
FOXBOROUGH, MA — In an effort to relieve the stress of the Patriots' disappointing 31-34 loss to the Buffalo Bills, New England head coach Bill Belichick reportedly relaxed at home Sunday night by soaking in a bathtub filled with warm entrails. Belichick, who admitted that blowing a 21-point lead over a division rival had left him feeling frustrated, angry, and extremely nervous, said his anxiety over the Patriots struggling with their fundamentals "simply melted away" the moment he eased his body into a tub brimming with freshly disemboweled internal organs. "Immediately after returning from Buffalo, I was feeling fairly disheartened and knew I needed to unwind, so I went straight home, headed down into my sanctum, and filled up the bathtub with bubbling, steaming hot viscera," Belichick said. "There's just something about the scent of gastric acid and the silky feel of intestines between your toes that's so refreshing. It really helps you forget about giving up nine completions of 20 yards or more." "Oh, it's really hot," added Belichick, describing the moment he first dipped a toe into the torrid innards. "Every now and then, it just does me good to remember what it felt like when my body held human life and warmth." Belichick said soaking for more than an hour in entrails provided an excellent diversion from the painful memories of the Patriots' secondary missing tackles, the offensive line's atrocious run blocking, and quarterback Tom Brady throwing four interceptions. According to Belichick, deeply breathing in the gamy, earthy reek of recently eviscerated organs was both invigorating and soothing. The 59-year-old coach told reporters that completely immersing himself in bodily fluids transported him to a serene place where the Patriots defense has not allowed more yards than any other team in the NFL this season and where his blackened and decayed soul could take solace. In addition, Belichick created a tranquil environment by lighting several candles made from human tallow and using an aromatherapy diffuser to enjoy the placating vapors of an essential oil extracted from charred flesh. "All the problems of the defense just seem to disappear when you inhale the uplifting scent of that burnt skin," Belichick said. "The moment I began savoring the delightful odor of scorched muscle tissue, I felt far more relaxed and at peace." "It made me realize we can correct mistakes, improve our schemes, play with more focus, and crush opponents until all of their lifeless, broken bodies are scattered facedown on the field," he added. During the relaxing bath, Belichick said he added an extra bucket of hot entrails on several occasions, placed chilled slices of kidney over his fatigued eyes, gently massaged his lower back with a femur, and calmed his nerves by sipping a cup of bile tea. The three-time Super Bowl champion coach also confirmed he reduced the anxiety caused by 93 yards in penalties by listening to his Sounds Of The Rwandan Genocide CD. Belichick said its high-quality recordings of blood-curdling screams and the hoarse pleas of a mother begging for someone to spare her children, as well as its white noise of constant moaning, weeping, and the digging of mass graves, put him in a meditative state. According Belichick, as he sunk below the surface of digestive fluids and opened his eyes, staring up at a gall bladder, small intestine, and spleen bobbing along in the fetid mixture of enzymes, mucus, chyme, blood, and feces, he realized the Patriots have a lot to be optimistic about following the defeat, including Wes Welker's 217 receiving yards and solid pass protection for Tom Brady. Although in recent years he has attempted to relieve the stress of NFL losses by watching game film of opponent's injuries, curling up on the couch to peruse favorite passages in his first edition of the Necronomicon — which is handsomely bound in the skin of stillborn babies — or enjoying a prized collection of human skulls from the Cambodian Civil War, Belichick said nothing was as soothing as bathing in entrails. "It just makes me so much more…whole," Belichick said. "Now I feel good enough to go enjoy a fire in the crematorium out back, but first I should probably clean up the rest of Devin McCourty."

WASHINGTON — In a stirring display of his commitment to the institution he pledged his life to 34 years ago, Associate Justice John Paul Stevens renewed his vows to the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday. Entering the courtroom in a long flowing robe, Stevens walked down the aisle toward a misty-eyed Chief Justice John Roberts, who stood waiting to re-administer the oath. "I, John Paul Stevens, do solemnly swear to faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me, till death do I part," declared a radiant Stevens. "I only wish [late President] Gerald [Ford] could have been here to give me away again. " The ceremony was followed by a modest but elegant reception at the Kennedy Center, where Roberts and the 89-year-old Stevens shared the honorary first dance.

Trump Regrets Choosing Kavanaugh After Supreme Court Nominee Keeps Talking About How Much He Respects Women
WASHINGTON — Suddenly rethinking his selection amid an already tumultuous confirmation process, President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday he regrets choosing Brett Kavanaugh after hearing the Supreme Court nominee talk extensively about the high regard in which he holds women. "Whoa, hang on — when I nominated him, I thought it was pretty clear where he stood with the opposite sex, but now he's on TV going on and on about how all women are entitled to dignity and respect," said the president, explaining that while he was on board with Kavanaugh's decision to deny all accusations of sexual assault, he began to have second thoughts after hearing his nominee describe a lifelong record of promoting equality for women. "I'm thinking, Is this really the type of guy I want on the highest court in the land? I'd be fine if he were just going around talking about how much he values women who are beautiful, but he shouldn't be saying all this other stuff. What if it affects the way he rules? I should probably just withdraw the nomination before people start questioning my judgment." At press time, sources reported President Trump had placed a frantic phone call to U.S. circuit judge Amy Barrett, saying her views on women could definitely be trusted.

Inconsolable Jeff Sessions Tries To Commit Suicide By Smoking Joint
WASHINGTON — Following months of bruising criticism from Democrats and President Trump alike, an inconsolable Jeff Sessions was reportedly trying to commit suicide Thursday by smoking a joint. "I swore I'd never take the coward's way out, but what choice do I have?" said a teary-eyed Sessions, carefully laying a sealed envelope containing his farewell note on a tool bench in his garage as he raised a lighter to the marijuana cigarette with trembling hands. "This is it. I've taken four puffs to make sure there's no chance of survival. It should only be a matter of minutes now. Oh, what a wretched, ignominious ending. Goodbye, cruel world, I'm sorry I've failed you so." At press time, Sessions reportedly realized he had died after being overcome by a euphoric, floating feeling.

In Stunning Change Of Character, Bill Belichick Adopts Half-Dozen Dogs From Humane Society
FOXBOROUGH, MA — In a shocking reversal of behavior, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick reportedly adopted a half-dozen dogs from a local humane society Friday, saving the canines from euthanasia. "I just love these pooches," said Belichick, smiling and chuckling as the six dogs licked at his face. "They're so cute. I like to play with them in my backyard." At press time, Belichick was reportedly promising each of the dogs a "very special treat." UPDATE: Bill Belichick Builds New Tight End From Mutilated Dog Parts

Bill Belichick Places Rob Gronkowski In Patriots' Injured Reserve Cage
FOXBOROUGH, MA — After the star tight end suffered a torn ACL and MCL in his right knee last Sunday, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick announced this week that Rob Gronkowski has officially been placed in the team's injured reserve cage. "It's a huge loss, but with that type of injury we really have no choice but to shut Rob down and put him in the IR cage for the rest of the year," said Belichick, adding that the 24-year-old tight end has joined teammates Jerod Mayo, Vince Wilfork, Tommy Kelly, Sebastian Vollmer, Justin Francis, Adrian Wilson, and Tyronne Green in the Patriots' 10-by-10-foot electrified high-tensile-wire injured reserve enclosure. "He's obviously not going to return for at least eight to 12 months, but that will give him the chance to heal up and get ready for next season. We'll obviously be closely monitoring him and sending someone down there every two or three days to ensure that he's making progress and to refill the water bowls." Belichick also confirmed that Gronkowski would not be allowed to rush his recovery, stressing that any attempt to escape the IR cage will lead to "far more serious injuries."

Hillary Clinton Assured Drop In Polls Just Indication People Haven't Abandoned Ideals Yet
WASHINGTON — Amidst a recent decline in support from likely primary voters, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was assured by campaign staffers Monday that her drop in the polls was merely an indication that people have not yet abandoned their ideals. "Don't worry, voters are just hesitant to give up on their most cherished principles at this point in the race, but give it a few months," said Clinton aide Patricia Bartley, reassuring the current Democratic frontrunner that surging support for Bernie Sanders would plummet once people discarded their dream of electing a leader as committed to progressive ideas as they were. "By January, when almost all Democrats have bitterly come to accept that anything less than forfeiting what matters to them most will probably put Jeb Bush in the White House, they'll be back on your side." Bartley went on to say, however, that there might be cause for concern if voters were still somehow clinging to their deep-seated convictions this time next year.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg Returns To Off-Season Lifeguarding Job
ALEXANDRIA, VA — Saying she hadn't missed a summer since she was on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Tuesday that she had once again returned to her off-season lifeguarding job at Splash Central waterpark. "They basically pay me $12 an hour just to sit in a chair and work on my tan all day — not to mention flirt with the hotties — so what's not to like?" said Ginsburg, 84, slathering sunscreen on her bare arms as she noted that while it could get a little stressful watching over the "little shits running wild" in the Kiddie Cove area, it was otherwise "pretty chill" and far better than being stuck inside all day while court was in session. "Plus, employees get half-off at the snack bar, and after work we all just go drinking or hang out in the parking lot getting fucking blazed. I've also been hooking up with this other lifeguard, Hunter. I hope he keeps working here during break when he goes off to college next year, but, if not, this place is crawling with studs." Ginsburg went on to say that she definitely has a more fun off-season job than Justice Breyer, who reportedly caddies for rich assholes that never fucking tip.

GOP Attacks Christine Blasey Ford For Never Coming Forward To Testify
WASHINGTON — Claiming that her refusal to appear before them and testify called into question all of her accusations, GOP officials attacked Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford for never coming forward during Thursday's public hearing. "Dr. Ford was extremely disrespectful by refusing to show up today. We set up this hearing and sat there for hours waiting, yet we didn't hear a single word from her," said Senator Chuck Grassley, who claimed the Senate now had no choice but to move forward on the confirmation vote since Ford had outright refused to publicly defend her allegations or even enter the Capitol Building. "Her absence clearly discredits her entire story. Brett Kavanaugh was brave enough to show up, he spoke very clearly and eloquently, and everyone here carefully listened to what he had to say. My colleagues sacrificed their time and energy to prepare a number of important questions and waited around, but we just got crickets." Grassley added that it was completely unprofessional for his Democratic colleagues Dianne Feinstein, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Mazie Hirono to skip the hearing as well.

Charlottesville Suspect Might Have Received Tacit Support From High-Level Government Figure
WASHINGTON — Suggesting he did not act alone but with implicit backing at the highest levels, the FBI said Monday that the suspect charged with murder for ramming his car into a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville over the weekend may have received tacit support from a powerful U.S. government figure. "While James Alex Fields Jr. was the man behind the wheel, we have every reason to believe that he benefited from the quiet patronage of someone of great importance in the American executive branch," said FBI director Christopher Wray, adding that the agency has for months suspected that white nationalists had an influential de facto ally in that arm of government and that recent events have only validated their theory. "Rather than openly declare common cause with U.S. neo-Nazi terrorist acts, we believe this official prefers to discreetly provide assistance from a removed position where he can operate with at least a modicum of plausible deniability." At press time, the FBI said it was not quite ready to release the individual's name but said it likely would soon, as evidence continued to mount every day.

Clinton Promises To Enact Agenda Whether Or Not She Elected
LAS VEGAS — After laying out her vision for the country during the first Democratic debate Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton reportedly vowed that she would enact her agenda whether or not she is elected. "A quality, affordable education should be accessible to all Americans who are willing to put in the hard work, and I promise that I will carry through this initiative whether or not I become the next president of the United States," said Clinton, asserting that support or opposition from the nation's voters would have zero impact on her implementation of such a platform in the years ahead. "Tax relief for the middle class and small businesses, the defense of reproductive rights for all women, and universal background checks for gun purchases will be accomplished regardless of whether you agree or disagree, or if I receive the Democratic nomination or 270 electoral votes in the general election. All of these things will come to be." At press time, the presidential hopeful looked directly into the camera and declared that her plan to create a path to citizenship for undocumented workers was already underway and could not be stopped.

Clinton Ominously Tells Iowan Supporters To Mark Front Doors With Campaign Logo Before Sundown
DES MOINES, IA — Declaring that all voting-age citizens who took the measures would be spared, Hillary Clinton ominously instructed her supporters throughout Iowa to mark their front doors with her campaign logo before sundown, sources confirmed Sunday. "All those residing in Iowa take heed: Your home shall bear the mark of my campaign this eve, or may God help you," said the Democratic candidate after dispatching a phalanx of campaign staffers to all four corners of the state to spread the message of her directive. "Be within your dwellings with the doors closed and locked before nightfall, and do not cross the threshold before the sun rises again in the sky. The emblem of the red-and-blue H will protect my true voters." At press time, Clinton issued a statement ordering all Iowan supporters who remain on Monday morning to bring forth their progeny between 18 and 34 years of age to the polls.

Hillary Clinton Relaxing Before Debate With Few Hours Of Debate Practice
GOFFSTOWN, NH — Describing it as a much-needed escape from the hype and pressure surrounding the event, aides from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign confirmed that the candidate has been taking it easy and kicking back ahead of Saturday's Democratic debate with a few hours of intensive debate practice. "Secretary Clinton knows how important it is to feel relaxed and refreshed tonight, so she's using this time to unwind by running repeatedly through each of Bernie Sanders' main talking points and her rebuttals for every single one of them," said campaign chairman John Podesta, adding that after a week of nonstop campaigning across the Midwest, Clinton was clearly enjoying her time off by mellowing out and rehearsing statistics about gun violence, unemployment, and illegal immigration while standing perfectly poised and attentive. "Taking a deep breath, putting up her feet, and just sparring on campaign finance reform and answering rapid-fire questions from our foreign policy prep team is what she really needs right now. It's been great to see her just veg out like this." At press time, Clinton had closed her eyes and sat back in her green room as she listened to a playlist of every one of Martin O'Malley's media appearances on her iPod.

New Hampshire Covered In Shadow As Floating Clinton Campaign Headquarters Takes Up Position Over State
JACKSON, NH — Drawing tens of thousands of residents out of their homes and businesses to stare upward into the sky, Hillary Clinton's colossal, floating campaign headquarters reportedly moved into position over New Hampshire this morning, casting the entire state into darkness. "I was just driving down Route 302 when I heard this deep, pulsing drone and saw a dark line of shadow moving down the mountainside toward me — I nearly drove off the road," said local resident Patrick Schoenberg, who, like hundreds of other motorists, pulled off to the side of the highway and looked up at the 9,500-square-mile Hillary for America campaign vessel as it slowly crawled across the horizon and blotted out all daylight. "It finally came to a stop an hour or so ago. But its engines just keep whirring constantly, rattling the house. My kids won't stop crying." At press time, the state's 1.3 million residents were reportedly cowering in their basements after the gigantic red H on the vessel's underside lit up and 300 enormous mechanical arms began slowly descending into each of the state's voting precincts.

New Yorkers Cower As Clinton Victory Speech Reverberates Across Entire State
ALBANY, NY — Covering their ears as the thunderous sound violently shook buildings and shattered glass windows, New York residents reportedly cowered in shock and fear Tuesday night as Hillary Clinton's primary election victory speech reverberated across the entire state. "Thank you all so much — today, you proved once again there's no place like home," said the Democratic presidential candidate, as her deafening address, which seemed to come from all sides at once, boomed across the landscape, setting off car alarms and forcing drivers to pull over to the side of the road in all 62 New York counties. "The race for the nomination is in the home stretch, and victory is in sight. You have carried us every step of the way with passion and determination. I am grateful to every one of you." At press time, sources in the upcoming primary states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania reported witnessing ripples in their water glasses as the opening line of Clinton's stump speech swelled in the distance.

Female Presidential Candidate Who Was United States Senator, Secretary Of State Told To Be More Inspiring
NEW YORK — Citing her lackluster support among young voters, campaign consultants to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner who has served as both a U.S. senator and secretary of state, reportedly instructed the candidate this week to be more inspiring. "Right now, voters are looking for a candidate who stands for real societal change, someone who can stir something inside them," said media advisor Jim Margolis, urging the woman — who overcame entrenched societal biases to build a successful legal career, became the first female senator elected in the state of New York, oversaw the Department of State during a period of widespread international tumult, and, if elected, would be the first female president in American history — to appear more uplifting to voters. "Many young people have completely lost faith in the political process, and they want to believe that true progress is actually possible. They want someone who embodies progressive ideals." Margolis added that Clinton was too much a part of the establishment she spent decades breaking down barriers to enter.

Nation Dreading Next 6 Months Of Watching Candidates Trying To Relate To It
WASHINGTON — Shuddering at the thought of the barrage of daily spectacles they would soon be subjected to, citizens across the nation reported Friday they were dreading having to spend the next half year watching presidential candidates attempt to relate to them. "Oh God, I don't think I can handle six straight months of seeing the nominees trying as hard as they can to draw parallels between their experiences and our daily lives," said Salt Lake City resident Linda Rodie, just one of millions of Americans to voice their dismay upon realizing that, until polls close on November 8, they would be inundated with images of politicians donning plaid shirts, wearing hard hats, eating at local mom-and-pop restaurants, and overeagerly going through various other motions in an attempt to find common ground with voters. "We're going to have to hear them talk about their childhoods and their favorite foods, not to mention the part where they participate in some kind of pop culture fad to show that they, like us, know how to have fun and don't take themselves too seriously. And the whole time they'll be going on about shared values and small-town America and whatever else they think will resonate with us. Christ, I don't know how I'm going to make it through this." At press time, the nation had resolved to just get this over with by watching a video of a recent Hillary Clinton appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!

Hillary Clinton Appears Before Rally Completely Nude In Bid For Authenticity
'Here I Am, A Mere Human Being,' Says Naked Candidate RALEIGH, NC — Flatly declaring to audience members that she stood on stage as no more than a human being with nothing to hide, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly appeared Friday before a campaign rally completely nude in a bid to once and for all prove her authenticity. Moments after being introduced to an enthusiastic crowd by North Carolina congressman G. K. Butterfield, Clinton is said to have taken the stage at PNC Arena, whereupon the 20,000 cheering spectators became abruptly silent at the sight of the fully naked former secretary of state walking slowly across the dais to the tune of John Mellencamp's "Pink Houses." "I am here today not as a politician, nor as a presidential candidate, but simply as a vulnerable, flawed human — just like any one of you," said Clinton, before pivoting in a slow circle at center stage with her arms outstretched at her sides and her palms held open, presenting to the crowd the entirety of her nude body. "Look upon me, friends. Go ahead and truly look. What you see before you is a living, breathing woman standing here exactly as she was created. I am unadorned. I am without artifice. I am real." "This, North Carolina, is Hillary Rodham Clinton," she continued. The former first lady, who throughout the rally spoke while clutching a handheld microphone inches from her exposed breasts, was then said to have elaborated for nearly 60 minutes on her essential nature and the shared human experience of being composed of humble organic matter, her pale, naked flesh standing in stark relief against the backdrop of her campaign logo. In addition to foregoing clothing, sources said Clinton appeared without makeup and allowed her hair to fall naturally to her bare shoulders, her unvarnished nude image projected on the arena's 30-foot Jumbotron screen as she described herself as a "fragile, impermanent vessel." Those in attendance reported that Clinton's speech — which often returned to the theme that, underneath the walls we put up to protect ourselves, we're all merely people striving, surviving, and trying to do our best — was met largely by uninterrupted silence from the stunned and increasingly uncomfortable audience. Sources added that during pauses in her address, Clinton's bare feet could be heard sticking against the floor as she walked across the raised platform. Witnesses also noted that the bright stage lights left Clinton's entire nude body covered in a visible sheen of slick sweat. "I ask that you trust me, just as I have placed my trust in you by standing here today utterly defenseless and unconcealed," said Clinton before taking a sip of water, as a supporter's cough echoed throughout the arena and the last of the crowd's "Fighting For Us" posters slowly sank into the sea of spectators. "You can believe in me because I am a person. I have fears, wants, and desires, as all of you do." "I have known love and loss, joy and anguish; in the lines and creases of my body, you can read a simple, straightforward story of hard-earned experience," she added. During several attempts to lock eyes with uneasy supporters in the front row, sources said Clinton strongly implored those in attendance not to divert their gaze from her naked form, stressing that her exposed body stood as a symbol of who, in essence, we all truly are. "Yes, this same body has survived childbirth, illness, and nearly seven decades of winters; and yes, it may now lack the suppleness and blush of youth," said Clinton, who, according to witnesses, then began gently running her hand along her sagging underarm skin and the varicose veins crisscrossing her thighs. "But all of these imperfections simultaneously make me a person like any other and a unique individual, and for that I am grateful. And so, when I say that I will fight to expand the middle class and ensure economic opportunity for all Americans, I can say it with the conviction of someone who has — as we all must one day — confronted and accepted the humbling limitations of the human body." "Let there be no doubt that I am who you perceive me to be — nothing more, nothing less," Clinton continued. Following the conclusion of her speech, sources confirmed that Clinton exited the stage to a smattering of applause and attempted to embrace resistant supporters along the ropeline before being whisked away to a fundraiser where she posed for photos with unsettled donors.

Clinton Aide Told To Leave Behind Weak Volunteer Who Collapsed During March To South Carolina
EMPORIA, VA — While attempting to help an exhausted, severely dehydrated canvasser to her feet Friday, a top aide to Hillary Clinton was reportedly instructed by the Democratic presidential candidate to discontinue his efforts and leave behind the enfeebled volunteer who had collapsed during the campaign's march to South Carolina. "There is nothing else to be done for her — take her placards, buttons, and clipboard, and keep moving," said Clinton, stating that the volunteer, who succumbed to fatigue after marching for 54 straight hours across the treacherous terrain between New Hampshire and South Carolina, would be replaced by another from the ranks. "This campaign has no room for the weak. Carry on." At press time, Clinton was heard demanding the company double their pace after catching a volunteer break formation.

Retreating Clinton Campaign Torches Iowa Town To Slow Advance Of Sanders Volunteers
HUMBOLDT, IA — After making sure to douse every home, farm, and business located in the municipality with gasoline, retreating Clinton campaign staffers reportedly set the central Iowa town of Humboldt ablaze Friday to stem the advance of Bernie Sanders volunteers. "Once we received word the Sanders campaign had begun canvassing in nearby Fort Dodge, we only had a matter of hours to burn everything to the ground," said communications director Jennifer Palmieri, who tossed a lit torch through the window of the town's hardware store before rushing over to help a group of Hillary for America workers erect a roadblock made of dead livestock to prevent all entrance to and exit from the city. "With so little time left before voting day, we simply can't allow them to establish a foothold in this part of the state. Besides, you can't convince anyone to caucus for Bernie Sanders if the civilian population is gone and all that's left is smoldering rubble." At press time, Clinton campaign staffers were spotted rigging a nearby bridge with C-4 as they hastily retreated to Algona.

Hillary Clinton Issues Single-Word Victory Speech Following Super Tuesday Results
'Satisfactory,' Says Candidate MIAMI — Striding briskly onto the stage and walking directly toward the podium without stopping to wave or smile at the cheering crowd in attendance, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly issued a single-word victory speech after significantly widening her delegate lead on Super Tuesday. "Satisfactory," the former first lady said in a flat, firm tone of voice while standing expressionless at the lectern, her unwavering gaze fixed straight forward. According to reports, the candidate then remained stationary at the podium for roughly a minute while the applause and chants around her steadily died down, blinking exactly three times before turning around and walking off the stage without saying another word. Following the rally, sources confirmed that Clinton sent a celebratory email to her supporters nationwide that stated only "Not yet sufficient."

Hillary Clinton Clearly Tailoring Debate Answers To Unclaimed New York Superdelegate
NEW YORK — Repeatedly emphasizing how her proposed policies would benefit middle-aged fathers of three who work in the public sector, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton appeared to be tailoring each of her answers during Thursday night's primary debate to a single unclaimed New York superdelegate, sources reported. "As your next president, I promise to make America work for all of us — not just the billionaires, but also middle-class families working to pay off a 30-year mortgage on a postwar duplex in Queens," said Clinton, adding that, now more than ever, the federal government needed to reduce the burden of student debt on those who had just taken their firstborn daughter on a tour of several colleges upstate. "In addition to reinvesting in our country's infrastructure — including that section of the Lexington Avenue line that gets so congested on the way to work every morning — I vow to strengthen Medicare and Social Security, providing a lifeline for families caring for an elderly, mobility-impaired aunt who lives in Hoboken. We also need to do more to help small businesses for every American who's ever toyed with the idea of quitting their day job and opening up an East Village gastropub." At press time, Clinton was reportedly urging New Yorkers to vote for her next Tuesday after dropping their youngest off at the Henry Gradstein elementary school.

Clinton Throws Flash Grenade To Divert Attention From Question About Senate Voting Record
MIAMI — Surreptitiously grabbing the explosive device stashed inside her lectern and pulling its pin as soon as she heard moderator Jorge Ramos mention her support for the Iraq War and the Wall Street bailout, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly threw a flash grenade onto the stage during Wednesday night's Democratic debate to divert attention away from a question about her Senate voting record. "That's an important question, Jorge, and one I'm happy to answer," said the former secretary of state just as the military-grade M84 stun grenade exploded, emitting a deafening blast and blinding flash of white light that prevented anything on stage from being seen or heard for the duration of Clinton's answer. After cowering with their hands over their ringing ears for approximately 70 seconds, rattled audience members, the debate's moderators, and fellow candidate Bernie Sanders were said to have regained their vision and hearing just in time to make out the final sentence of Clinton's response: "And that's why I've always stood on the side of the middle class and working families." At press time, a misty white gas was seen pouring from the base of Clinton's podium toward the moderators' desk as Ramos cited Clinton's changing positions on gay marriage, the Keystone XL pipeline, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Elderly Voter Never Thought She'd Get To See Female Presidential Nominee Called Heartless Ice Bitch During Her Lifetime
FAIRFAX, VA — Tearing up as she reflected on the significance of Hillary Clinton being named the presumptive Democratic candidate, 85-year-old voter Deborah Hanson told reporters Wednesday she never thought she'd get to see a female presidential nominee be called a heartless ice bitch during her lifetime. "When I was growing up, things were so different — it just didn't seem possible that I'd live to see the day when a woman would be selected to top a major political party's ticket while incessantly being called a shrieking harpy," said the retired schoolteacher, adding that even decades of advocating for women's equality hadn't fully prepared her for the reality of actually being able to cast her vote for a woman described by critics on social media as a rotten old cunt who's so fugly it was no wonder her husband slept with other women. "I've never forgotten that when I was a little girl, people said a woman could never be president, and now look how far we've come. To be so close to seeing the first woman who's alternately labeled both a lying whore and a psycho feminazi bimbo occupy this nation's highest office, and to watch her make important decisions about this country's future that would be relentlessly criticized as being the product of hysterical menopausal rages, would be nothing short of amazing." Hanson told reporters that while she understood the concerns of younger liberal women who oppose Clinton's candidacy, she hoped they would recognize how hard so many generations of American women had fought for a day when one of their own could become the most powerful person referred to as a frumpy, frigid bull dyke in the nation.

Campaign Announces Clinton Has Entered Incubation Period After Securing Nomination
Candidate Transitioning Into Mature Presidential Form Inside Cocoon, Aides Say NEW YORK — Immediately after she clinched the 2,383 delegates needed to secure the Democratic presidential nomination Monday night, campaign aides announced that Hillary Clinton had retreated to a dark corner of her Brooklyn headquarters and entered the beginning of a 16-week incubation period. Top-level staffers confirmed that the lengthy gestation phase, during which the former secretary of state will undergo significant physical and political changes while encased upside down in a gray-brown, 7-foot-tall chrysalis, will prepare the candidate for the difficult and protracted general election cycle ahead. Officials added that once Clinton has completed her transformation into her mature, final-stage form, she will wriggle free from her cocoon and return to the campaign trail. "As soon as we informed Hillary that she had reached the number of delegates necessary to secure the Democratic nomination, she thanked the staff and then promptly began secreting a thick, resinous substance from her oral gland and fashioning it into a protective casing around herself," said Hillary for America communications director Jennifer Palmieri, explaining to the press that Clinton has been eating several times her body weight daily while campaigning in preparation for the energy-intensive hibernation and metamorphosis process. "She completed her encasement several hours ago and is now pupating comfortably inside. As we speak, Hillary is rapidly altering, developing an entirely new anatomy and a complex vision for a united, prosperous America that works to lift up each and every one of us." "You can rest assured that once Hillary uses her powerful mandibles to chew her way out of the cocoon, she will emerge stronger than ever and ready to take on Donald Trump," Palmieri added. Officials within the campaign stated that the initial stage of Clinton's metamorphosis appeared to be proceeding on schedule, noting that after completing her chrysalis — a moist, semi-translucent husk attached via a silken thread to the rafters of her campaign strategy room — the former first lady began releasing enzymes that dissolved much of her soft tissue mass while her heart rate dropped to a single beat every 40 seconds. Moreover, a network of veins and arteries reportedly formed just beneath the pod's surface, which political experts stated would provide the candidate with a constant supply of oxygen as her political image and rigid presidential thorax slowly develop. Sources added that they were confident the pupa will be sufficiently advanced by late July to take part in the Democratic National Convention, where it is expected to be wheeled onstage to shed its mucosal lining in front of the assembled crowd, thereby officially signifying Clinton's acceptance of the nomination. "Although her metabolism may have slowed to a near halt and her body may be currently differentiating within the nutrient-rich liquid medium inside her suspended cocoon, Hillary remains committed to creating good-paying jobs, making college affordable for all citizens, and ensuring paid family and medical leave for hardworking Americans," said Palmieri, who noted that Clinton is expected to exit her chrysalis several hours prior to the first presidential debate on September 26, enough time for her lymph-covered body to dry off in the sun and for her to gain full control over her forelimbs before taking on her opponent. "While securing the nomination is a significant step, it's important to remember that we're only halfway there. The towering, full-grown version of Hillary that will emerge in several months still needs your vote in November." "But the choice is clear," she added. "When voters consider Hillary Clinton's constantly scanning compound eyes, her long record of helping middle-class families, and her barbed pincers poised and ready to strike, they'll see that she is the only candidate truly qualified to lead this nation." At press time, the latest polls showed Clinton's approval rating climbing to the highest levels of the campaign in the hours since she enclosed herself away from the public inside a thick shell of chitin.

Clinton Assures Tim Kaine She'll Continue Serving As President In Event Of Her Death
MIAMI — In their first official meeting Saturday as Democratic running mates, Hillary Clinton reportedly pulled aside her vice presidential pick, Virginia senator Tim Kaine, and quietly assured him that in the event of her death while in office, she would continue serving as commander-in-chief. "If something unfortunate happens to me in the next four years, I want you to know that not a single thing changes, and I will still carry out all duties of the presidency," said Clinton, explaining that should she as president succumb to an illness or accident, all national security, economic, foreign affairs, and social policy decisions would continue to go through her as usual. "I don't want you to worry or panic if I happen to pass away. Just know that nothing — not a degenerative illness nor the bonds of death — can prevent me from leading this country for the full duration of my term. Dying will not diminish my power, got it? Okay, glad to have you aboard." Clinton went on to state that, while tragic, her untimely demise would bring with it a number of political advantages, as no longer needing to sleep, eat, or breathe would free up significant amounts of time for her to focus on running for reelection.

Hillary Clinton: 'Young Girls Should Have An Equal Opportunity To One Day Feel Power Coursing Through Their Body'
PHILADELPHIA — In a stirring, heartfelt address Thursday night at the Democratic National Convention in which she laid out her vision for the future of the United States, presidential nominee Hillary Clinton stated that every young girl in the country deserved "an equal opportunity to one day feel raw, unbridled power coursing through her body." "I want to live in an America where every single girl has the chance to feel that the entire world is her puppet to command and to become intoxicated by the overwhelming euphoria that comes with knowing she can crush anyone, anywhere, at any time," said Clinton, her voice growing louder and more emphatic as she suggested that Americans needed to do more to close the gender gap and ensure that female youths from all walks of life could pursue futures in which they're continuously possessed by a rapturous bliss from wielding sweeping authority constrained by no legal or moral bounds. "My dream is that someday soon, it will not seem at all out of the ordinary for my granddaughter to literally quake with exhilaration from holding dominion over millions of people who have no choice but to comply with her every word. I will do everything I can to make sure that she, and every young girl like her, grows up in a nation that places no restrictions on her opportunities to feel total, limitless power pumping through her every vein." Clinton concluded by listing several policy proposals that she hoped would help spark an unquenchable fire for control deep inside young girls' very cores and set them on a path to eventually basking in the warm, all-consuming glow of possessing unchecked supremacy.

'Look At All The Tiny Houses,' Whispers Trump As Jet Reaches 10,000 Feet
SAN DIEGO — Leaning forward in his seat and pushing his face close to the window, presidential candidate Donald Trump reportedly whispered "Look at all the tiny houses" to himself as his private jet reached 10,000 feet during a flight to his next campaign event Wednesday. "Whoa, there are so many," said the presumptive Republican nominee in a hushed but excited tone of voice, squinting while using his thumb and forefinger to pretend that he was holding one of the small buildings as he sat entirely alone in the cabin of his private Cessna 750 Citation X aircraft. "Oh, that one has a pool! And there's that big one over there — I bet that's a school." As the plane then ascended to 20,000 feet, a wide-eyed Trump was reportedly overheard counting aloud all the clouds he could see.

'This Will Be The End Of Trump's Campaign,' Says Increasingly Nervous Man For Seventh Time This Year
SALISBURY, MD — Repeating identical comments he had made in June, July, August, September, and twice in November, increasingly nervous local man Aaron Howe responded to Donald Trump's call to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Monday by once again stating this would be the end of the Republican frontrunner's campaign, sources confirmed. "Well, that's it — you just can't say those kinds of things and expect to be taken seriously any longer," said an anxious Howe, his voice quavering slightly as he spoke aloud the very same words he had previously uttered in reaction to remarks about Mexicans, women, the disabled, former POW John McCain, and a number of other targeted parties. "That's the final nail in the coffin right there. There's no way he's coming back from this one." At press time, a visibly tense Howe was steadily amassing the angst and exasperation that would be unleashed in his seventh expletive-filled exclamation of the year when he catches sight of the newest set of GOP poll numbers.

Trump Raises $50 Million At Fundraiser Where GOP Donors Get To Watch Him Weep For 2 Hours
WASHINGTON — In an effort to bolster his campaign war chest after reporting historically low levels of cash on hand heading into July, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reportedly raised $50 million at a Thursday night fundraiser dinner in which GOP donors were given the chance to watch him weep for two consecutive hours. "Witnessing Mr. Trump stand hunched over at the dais as tears began streaming down his flushed, contorted face made for a truly wonderful evening, and it was an opportunity I simply could not pass up," said billionaire industrialist David Koch, a longtime Republican donor who was reportedly one of 200 campaign contributors who paid $250,000 a plate to see the distraught GOP nominee break down into a fit of heavy sobs and occasional moans over the course of 120 minutes in the Grand Ballroom of the Mayflower Hotel. "I know there was incredible demand for tickets to this event, and personally, I would have been willing to pay twice as much as I did to hear him sniffling as he wiped away the tears from his eyes before burying his face in his hands. This was easily the most enjoyable political fundraising event I have attended in decades." Sources confirmed the campaign is also planning on offering donors who contribute over $5 million the chance to eat dinner alone with Donald Trump while he chokes on a steak.

Trump Campaign Selects Mike Pence As Concrete Reminder That This All Really Happening
NEW YORK — Confirming reports circulating in the media, members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign officially revealed Friday they have selected Indiana governor Mike Pence as a concrete reminder that this — all of this — is actually, legitimately happening. "I am honored to announce that Gov. Mike Pence will be joining the campaign [as a material indication that everything you've seen and heard is indeed reality]," said Paul Manafort, the chairman of the Trump campaign, declaring that the governor would bring to the Republican ticket a proven conservative record and a stark physical embodiment of the realization that the past year has not just been some crazy dream, but rather a series of actual events that is building to an honest-to-God electoral vote come November. "Gov. Pence has served his state as a strong and principled leader, and he is determined to serve his country as [a glaring signal that, at this point, it is much too late to turn back the clock or undo what has been begun, and that the only thing that can be done is recognize just how very, very real this all, in fact, is]. We're happy to have him aboard." At press time, Pence had taken the stage to deliver the emphatic message that he, Trump, the stage they were standing on, the banner behind them, and the large crowd cheering their names were 100 percent genuine, existent entities and not simply figments of the nation's fevered imagination.

Trump Relaxes After Debate By Slipping Back Into Nice, Warm Personal Reality
NEW YORK — Sighing contentedly as the evening's stresses melted away, Donald Trump reportedly kicked back and relaxed after the first presidential debate Monday night by slipping into his nice, warm personal reality, sources confirmed. "Ahhh," said the GOP nominee in audible satisfaction as he eased his way into the pleasant universe of his own making, growing calmer and more comfortable as he submerged himself fully within the soothing world of facts, opinions, and personal adulation that exist solely to him alone. "Mmmmm, much better." According to sources, Trump then sat back with his eyes closed and a serene smile on his face as he allowed a refreshing rush of extremely positive reviews of his debate performance to wash over him.

Trump's Prefrontal Cortex Admits It Can't Possibly Filter All Impulsive Comments Coming From Rest Of Brain
NEW YORK — Saying it was completely exhausted and overwhelmed by its strenuous workload, Donald Trump's prefrontal cortex admitted Thursday it was simply unable to filter through the torrent of impulsive comments coming from the rest of the presidential candidate's brain. "I'm just completely inundated with erratic thoughts and knee-jerk reactions from all sides — there's no way I can possibly screen everything that's being produced in here," said the higher-order structure of Trump's brain responsible for impulse control and long-term planning, adding that the number of hastily formed ideas it was expected to evaluate and cull before they reached the speech motor cortex had been increasing steadily over the past year. "Sometimes, four or five different instinctive urges will try to get through all at once, and it's just impossible to stop every one of them. I keep thinking they'll eventually peter out, but there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. I've been doing this for 70 years — I'm just drained." Trump's prefrontal cortex admitted that it could use significant help from the neural circuits in the angular gyrus and posterior cingulate that are tasked with moral decision-making, but noted that the ineffectual structures had stopped functioning years ago.

Trump: 'Remember, This Is Your Last Chance To Get Out Before This Goes Any Further'
CLEVELAND — After waiting for the cheers and loud chants of his name to die down, Donald Trump reportedly began his headlining speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention by taking a moment to remind the members of his party this was their final opportunity to get out of this thing before it went any further. Trump, who stepped onto the stage to officially accept his party's nomination amid tremendous fanfare, opened his remarks by making it clear that the American people's last chance to back out of this whole situation had arrived, and that if they did not bow out now, they would be in it with him until the very end. "Good evening, everybody, and thank you very much — wow, what an incredible night," said Trump, addressing a frenzied crowd of 20,000 in Quicken Loans Arena and millions of additional viewers watching on television and online. "Before I begin tonight, I just want to be very clear about one particular matter. I want to be certain you fully understand the consequences of what is happening here, because this moment — right here, right now — represents the very last opportunity for you to turn back. This is it." "After tonight, you'll be just as much a part of this whole thing as I am," he added. "And we'll be in it together through November, and quite possibly, the next four years after that. You and me. You sure you understand that?" Trump went on to state that, at this point, he has been campaigning for over a year, so every single voter possessed a sufficient level of information to comprehend what was going on and no one could justifiably claim, later on, that they didn't realize what they were getting into. The billionaire businessman then added that, if voters and the delegates representing them weren't completely sure about this, now — right this very second — was the final possible point in this contest at which they could wash their hands of all this, because once he formally accepts the nomination, voting precincts across the country will begin printing ballots for the 2016 election, and his name — Donald Trump — will appear at the top as an actual exercisable option for President of the United States. In addition, the 70-year-old real estate developer emphasized that every voter needed to be confident about this choice and willing to make their peace with it, observing that for the next several months the words "Republican nominee for president" will appear below his name every time he appears on television, and that he and he alone will serve as the official voice of the GOP in debates with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. "Again, I just want to give fair warning here," said Trump, who explained that backing out wouldn't even be that difficult to do as he gestured toward the arena's exits in a pointed reminder to those in attendance that calling it quits was, in fact, an option that, for a few more moments, was still available to them. "Look, you know me pretty well by this point. You know the things I might say about certain marginalized groups, how I tend to respond to criticism, the kinds of people I have expressed my admiration for. And most of all, you know full well that I'm not going to change any of those things — not even a little bit." "And now I will be your nominee, representing you — all of you," he continued. "I'd just like to pause a moment so everyone has a chance to really think about that." Trump then reportedly lowered his gaze and remained silent at the lectern for a full minute, a stoic expression settling upon his face as he allowed the RNC attendees and millions more watching at home to quietly reflect on everything he has said, everything he has done, everything he has proposed, and everything he has insinuated since he entered the presidential race. Looking up again, the GOP candidate reiterated that voters were now standing at the most decisive moment to date in the campaign, and that if they were still wishfully imagining that some other outcome might present itself, they had a few remaining seconds to stop themselves and bow out before the option to do so disappeared for good. "One more time, just to clarify: Americans will be going to the polls November 8, their votes will be counted, and if I win, I will become president of the United States of America," the celebrity billionaire said. "Me. Donald Trump. Is that absolutely clear? Is it?" "Okay, then," he continued after a pause of several seconds. "Let's go ahead with this."

​Report: All Standing Between Trump And Presidency Is Nation That Made Him Billionaire Celebrity
WASHINGTON — According to a Pew Research Center report released Monday that analyzed the Republican candidate's chances of winning the general election in November, the only thing currently standing between Donald Trump and the presidency is the nation that made him a billionaire celebrity. "We are looking at an extremely tight race for the White House that will ultimately come down to the preferences of an electorate that has enabled Trump to amass an incredible fortune and maintain a prominent place in the national spotlight for over 30 years," said lead researcher Moira Larson, explaining that the lone remaining obstacle to Trump becoming commander-in-chief was securing enough support from voters who routinely read multiple articles about him every single day and tune in to his every televised appearance just to see him speak. "Based on our findings, the people of this country — who have enabled him to profit wildly off of numerous luxury products and real estate holdings, closely followed his romantic exploits in the tabloids for decades, and watched multiple television shows he's hosted or produced — are now the sole barrier to Trump taking the highest political office in the world." The report follows on the heels of a related study showing that the major obstacle standing between Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the Oval Office is a nation that doesn't like women possessing any authority whatsoever.

Trump Surrogate Enjoying Thrill Of Not Knowing What She Going To Be Defending Minute To Minute
NEW YORK — Telling reporters she likes to be kept on her toes, Donald Trump surrogate Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday she has been enjoying the thrill of never knowing what comment or behavior she is going to be defending minute to minute. "Every time I sit down for an interview on cable news or a radio call-in show, I really have no clue whether I'll need to offer an impassioned defense of disparaging remarks Mr. Trump made about a specific woman's physical attributes, a blanket statement about an entire ethnic group, or a speech calling for an unconstitutional immigration policy — it really keeps things exciting," said McEnany, explaining that she was thankful her job gave her such a wide variety of inflammatory statements to spin as positives and didn't simply consist of walking back the same stale scandals day after day. "The possibilities are truly endless in this position. I could be on Anderson Cooper 360° defusing Mr. Trump's latest impulsive remarks on anything from nuclear proliferation to criminal justice, and then just an hour or two later on CNN Tonight, I might need to explain away a series of antagonistic and barely comprehensible tweets targeting a particular journalist or politician that I read right before going on-air. Every day is a new adventure." McEnany added that despite the challenges of her role, it was comforting to know she could respond to any question by claiming that Hillary Clinton is deathly ill.

Trump Sick And Tired Of Mainstream Media Always Trying To Put His Words Into Some Sort Of Context
NEW YORK — Emphasizing that the practice was just more evidence of journalists' bias against him, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stated Thursday that he was sick and tired of the mainstream media always attempting to place his words into some kind of context. "The corrupt news media is constantly taking the things I say and putting them within the larger context of politics and global events — it's absolutely sickening what they do," said Trump, adding that many of the comments he has made — including his call yesterday for Russia to hack into the emails of his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton and publish the contents — had been repeatedly and unfairly contextualized with relevant facts about the world and pertinent information about the situation in which they were stated. "It's completely shameful to take words I've spoken or written and try to connect them to some kind of objective reality. I say something, and the next thing I know, a crooked reporter is telling everyone what I said along with a fact-based explanation of what its implications are and why it matters. It's ridiculous, and it has to stop." Trump added that he would not hesitate to ban any news organization from his campaign that continued to twist his statements by implying they held any specific meaning about or relation to the world we inhabit.

'Why Can I Never Seem To Say The Right Thing?' Weeps Trump Into Pillow
NEW YORK — Quickly running into his bedroom and slamming the door behind him after hearing public criticism of the statements he made regarding the family of a fallen Muslim-American U.S. Army captain, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reportedly threw himself on his bed Tuesday and asked himself "Why can I never seem to say the right thing?" while weeping into his pillow. "Every time I open my mouth, the words come out all wrong," Trump reportedly said in between long, heaving sobs, his voice muffled by the pillow as he occasionally pounded a balled-up fist into the mattress. "I try so hard, but I just can't talk right, and everyone gets so mad at me. I just wish I could talk nicely like everyone else." At press time, an exhausted Trump had reportedly cried himself into a perfectly sound sleep.

Trump Casually Informs Pence He Going To Make One Or Two Appearances During Speech
CLEVELAND — Pulling his running mate aside backstage at the Republican National Convention just minutes before the Indiana governor was scheduled to formally accept the party's vice presidential nomination, GOP candidate Donald Trump casually informed Mike Pence that he would probably make one or two quick appearances during the Midwestern conservative's headlining speech tonight. "Hey, Mike, just a heads-up: I'm going to pop onstage a few minutes into your speech to give a little wave and maybe say a few words, but don't worry about it — I'll keep it pretty quick," said Trump, adding that he was also considering coming out a second time about 10 or 15 minutes later to flash a thumbs-up and mention how they were going to "win big" this November. "I'll just jump out there and amp up the crowd for a little bit and then you can get back to your speech. Actually, I wouldn't rule out coming out a third time if things start to get slow toward the end and you need a little juice. Come to think of it, you might just want to keep things short and throw it over to me. I'd say do a quick five minutes introducing me and I'll come right out and take it from there." Before leaving the vice presidential nominee to make his final preparations ahead of his speech, Trump is said to have offhandedly noted to Pence that a video message from the billionaire businessman would be playing behind him for the duration of his remarks.

Trump Vomits Immediately After Seeing Everyday Americans Up Close
ST.

"Oh God, look at them — I think I'm gonna be sick," said the visibly woozy and uncomfortable Trump, repeatedly pausing his introductory remarks to double over and retch uncontrollably as he looked out upon the dozens of average American men and women seated just a few feet from him. "Here it comes. Hurrghh, hurrrghh, huhhleeggah. Those faces — those horrible faces. Huuuhhhllghghh." Trump was reportedly able to pull himself together after firmly shutting his eyes and keeping them closed for the duration of the debate.

Trembling, Pallid RNC Attendees Undergo Second Day Of Firearm Withdrawal
CLEVELAND — Noting that the Secret Service had barred the possession of guns at this year's Republican National Convention, sources at Quicken Loans Arena reported Tuesday that hundreds of trembling, pallid attendees were currently struggling to endure a second day of firearm withdrawal. "Boy, the people here are in a pretty rough spot — all the color's drained out of their faces and almost all of them are muttering something to themselves," said arena maintenance team leader Dave Walsh, who noted that it was easy to identify the victims of gun withdrawal by their wide, bloodshot eyes, thick beads of perspiration on their foreheads, and the way they wandered aimlessly around the convention floor grasping reflexively at their hips in a vain effort to grip a weapon that wasn't there. "I've caught at least a dozen delegates begging members of the security detail for a quick peek at their sidearms, and just a few minutes ago I walked right in on a guy sobbing in the men's room." Walsh added that things appeared to be particularly dire over by the Texas and Arkansas delegations, where every member was curled up silently on the floor clutching their knees tightly to their chests with a dead, expressionless look frozen in their eyes.

Trump Campaign Training Poll Watchers To Spot Any Suspicious Skin Colors On Election Day
HARRISBURG, PA — Instructing volunteers to remain alert and pay close attention to every individual who arrives at their voting location, the "Trump Election Observer" section of Donald Trump's campaign website reportedly trains supporters to spot any suspicious skin colors they may see on Election Day, sources confirmed this week. "Keep an eye out for any of the skin tones appearing on the list below, none of which are allowable on November 8," read the webpage in part, reminding volunteers that watching out for certain suspect and disreputable complexions was the only way to ensure the Republican nominee had a fair shot at winning the election. "Be on the lookout for these two shades in particular, as they have historically proven to cause significant trouble. And remember that whenever you spot a dubious-looking skin pigmentation at your polling place, immediately confront the problem head-on." The site further stated that should a volunteer happen to notice a significantly high number of suspicious skin colors at their precinct, they should call their local Trump field office immediately so the campaign could formally contest the polling location's results.

Trump Raises Concern Over Members Of Urban Communities Voting More Than Zero Times
ATKINSON, NH — Warning supporters that the troubling practice could affect the outcome of the election, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump expressed strong concern Friday that members of urban communities were voting more than zero times, sources reported. "I've heard stories that some of these people in the inner cities are trying to steal the election by casting over zero ballots — we can't let this happen, folks," said Trump, who claimed that hundreds of urban voting precincts across the country often have turnout numbers that are far higher than zero percent of eligible voters. "Very trustworthy sources have told me that in many of these urban neighborhoods, people are voting in excess of zero times by mailing in a ballot under their own name or even just by walking right up to a polling place and voting without a problem — and the poll workers there will just go along with it. It's a terrible thing that's happening in those places, and it needs to be stopped." Trump added that concerned supporters should form groups, head to urban precincts, and "do what needs to be done" to take care of the problem.

Hell Now A Thriving Epicenter Of Gay Culture
THE MALEBOLGE, NETHER REGIONS OF DARKNESS — Noting the incredible rate at which the community has grown, sources confirmed Thursday that Hell, the Endless Kingdom of Misery, is now a booming haven of gay culture. The Great Abyss, home of the damned, is reportedly inhabited by some 600 million condemned homosexual or transgender souls, a large proportion of its total population, and has by many accounts blossomed into an oasis of gay activism and community events. "I've only been here for a few months, but I've already fallen in love with it," said 49-year-old Daniel Edelson, adding that he has already befriended hundreds of fellow gay men and women in the accursed underworld, all of whom have welcomed him with open arms. "The streets of fire and brimstone are full of so many great cafés, restaurants, bakeries, independent bookstores, and of course plenty of gay bars and clubs. There's just so much to do." "My favorite place is this wonderful little promenade along the River Styx, where couples always take walks together on the weekends," continued Edelson. "I'd say this is easily the most LGBT-friendly place I've ever lived." According to sources, the deepest bowels of Hell have over the past several millennia developed a thriving gay community that is said to rival the likes of the New York City neighborhood of Chelsea, San Francisco's Castro District, Soho in London, and the Boystown section of Chicago. Along with its wide variety of gay-friendly businesses, the Underworld is also home to The 666, a sprawling, five-story gay nightclub that is reportedly the largest such establishment ever built. Reports confirmed The 666 is one of the most popular destinations in the Nine Circles, offering drag shows, multiple dance floors, six-headed go-go dancers, and live music. "It's just nice to finally live in a place where I don't feel like an outcast or an outsider," said Vanessa Aldridge, 38, stressing that she has faced absolutely no discrimination since she, like all homosexuals and gay sympathizers, was sentenced to an eternity in Lucifer's Den immediately upon her death. "There's no stigma attached to openly being who I am here. Everyone is respected and free to live the way they want to live." "It's really refreshing, frankly, to live in a place where nobody gives me any weird looks when I walk hand-in-hand with my girlfriend," Aldridge continued. "And all of the other eternally damned homosexuals down here feel the same. I thank Satan every day for welcoming me here." Hell has been widely celebrated by gay rights leaders for its far-reaching acceptance of alternative lifestyles, and residents told reporters it is incredibly common to see a rainbow flag hanging over various shop awnings, in car windows, or atop thrones of blood-soaked bones and rotting flesh. Additionally, the Inferno's Gay Pride Parade, held every July in the Second Circle, is noted for its extravagance and high attendance rate. Reports confirmed that, with thousands more homosexual souls flooding the Gates of Hell every day, the Chasm of Wickedness and Sin has truly become a sanctuary for gays and lesbians alike, a feeling proudly shared by a majority of heterosexual locals. "The gay community has really flourished here, and I have to say, they've been great for the place," said Nephirem the Malevolent, a 10,000-year-old, 70-foot-tall minotaur who has resided in hell since rising from the ashes of a smokeless flame. "At the end of the day, they're just like anyone else. Everyone has the right to express their love for whomever they want. They don't bother me in the slightest, and if anything, we in the Dark Lord's Army encourage any and all public displays of affection between same-sex couples." "I think it's great that they've carved out such a strong community for themselves here," added the horned beast of ceaseless death and destruction. "I'm all for it." In stark contrast to Hell's ongoing embrace of persecuted groups, sources confirmed that Heaven remains the most bigoted and intolerant place in the universe.

Pope Insanity MXLV Selected
VATICAN CITY — Following the ceremonial rising of the white smoke and pealing of the St. Peter's Basilica bells earlier this afternoon, black clouds suddenly darkened the Vatican City sky as Catholic Church officials announced that the College of Cardinals had ended their two-day session and selected Pope Insanity MXLV. Moments after the announcement, the newly named Pope Insanity MXLV abruptly materialized on the St. Peter's balcony to an applauding crowd gathered below, and then raised his arms and emitted a piercing, high-pitched shriek as blood streamed down his forehead and thick smoke swirled around his body. Sources confirmed that after five minutes of complete silence, Insanity then clicked his tongue violently, calling hundreds of ravens, eagles, and vultures to surround the balcony and land upon him. "Here now begins the dawning of a new era for the Catholic Church," Insanity said, pausing again briefly as a swarm of hornets suddenly spewed out of his open mouth and flew into the Vatican City crowd. "This is the birth of a new Catholicism, one born from the darkness of the old and the madness of the new. Gleaming slivers slipping blackly o'er frosted bone and chiming fuckly kill the beast the smiling dog amen amen." "Incurvasti in fronte mihi, mi legiones," Insanity then screamed, while scratching furiously at his genitals. "Incurvasti!" As a black liquid slowly oozed from his nose, Insanity then dismissed half the audience to gather steel, wood, and rocks and bring them into St. Peter's Square, instructing the remaining half to gouge their eyes out immediately with a dull knife and await the "silent coming of the ivory snake, he breathes, he breathes." "Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" Insanity said, shaking as the fabric of space and time seemed to bend around him in undulating waves of light, color, and sound. "Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" "Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" Insanity added. Sources reported that, as Insanity's body repeatedly disappeared and rematerialized in different locations in St. Peter's Square, the new pope's skin then seemingly melted from his body, leaving nothing but a hollow gray skeleton. Pope Insanity MXLV's glowing flesh then immediately began to reform over the bones, sources confirmed. "I'm very excited about the changes that Pope Insanity was talking about for the church," said audience member and devout Catholic Bonnie Jenkins, as blood and pus poured down from her ears. "I mean, I thought the things he was saying about my body burning amid the skins of a thousand orphans and then reforming into a charging black stallion were a very interesting take on Church doctrine." "I think this will be very good for the church," added Jenkins, before being gripped in the talons of a now flying Pope Insanity MXLV, carried to the top of St. Peter's Basilica, and devoured.

Mitt Romney Haunted By Past Of Trying To Help Uninsured Sick People
BELMONT, MA — Though Mitt Romney is considered to be a frontrunner for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, the national spotlight has forced him to repeatedly confront a major skeleton in his political closet: that as governor of Massachusetts he once tried to help poor, uninsured sick people. Romney, who signed the state's 2006 health care reform act, has said he "deeply regrets" giving people in poor physical and mental health the opportunity to seek medical attention, admitting that helping very sick people get better remains a dark cloud hovering over his political career, and his biggest obstacle to becoming president of the United States of America. "Every day I am haunted by the fact that I gave impoverished Massachusetts citizens a chance to receive health care," Romney told reporters Wednesday, adding that he feels ashamed whenever he looks back at how he forged bipartisan support to help uninsured Americans afford medicine to cure their illnesses. "I'm only human, and I've made mistakes. None bigger, of course, than helping cancer patients receive chemotherapy treatments and making sure that those suffering from pediatric AIDS could obtain medications, but that's my cross to bear. "My hope is that Republican voters will one day forgive me for making it easier for sick people — especially low-income sick people — to go to the hospital and see a doctor," Romney added. "It was wrong, and I'm sorry. According to Romney, if he could do things over again, he would do everything he could to make certain that uninsured individuals got sicker and sicker until they died. Promising his days of trying to provide medical coverage to the gravely ill are behind him, Romney said that if elected president, he would never even think about increasing anyone's quality of life or trying to lower the infant mortality rate. In addition, Romney repeatedly apologized for wanting to help people suffering from diabetes, Crohn's disease, and anemia. "I don't know what got into me back then," Romney said. "Wanting to make sure people were able to have health insurance if they left their job. Providing a federally funded website so individuals could compare the costs of insurance providers. Making certain that somebody who earns less than 150 percent of the poverty level can receive the same health care coverage as me or any government official. All I can say is that I was young and immature, and I am not that person anymore. "The only solace I can take is in the hope that some of the folks I helped were terminally ill patients who eventually withered away and died," Romney added. Though Romney has apologized profusely, Beltway insiders said he would need to distance himself from his I-tried-to-help-sickpeople image. Sources noted that Romney's current promise to take away health care from anyone who can't afford it is a step in the right direction, but might not be enough. "The major strike against Mitt Romney is that he not only tried to help people get medical care, he actually did help people get medical care," conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg said. "No other Republican in the field has that type of baggage. And in the end, in order to defeat President Obama, the GOP needs someone who has a track record of never wanting to help sick people. Thus far, Romney is polling strongly in early primary states like New Hampshire and Iowa, but Republican strategists and voters agree that even in a general election, his sordid past would continue to dog him. "I don't think I can vote for someone like that," Pennsylvania Republican Eric Tolbert said. "He says he's sorry, but how do I know that's the real Mitt Romney? What happens if he gets elected and tries to help sick people again? "I like Michele Bachmann now," Tolbert added. "Because what this country needs is a president who doesn't give a fuck about helping people.

Paul Ryan Wondering If He Should Have Told Romney About This Guy He's Dating
DES MOINES, IA — After appearing at his first solo campaign event since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for vice president, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) reportedly began wondering if he ought to have told running mate Mitt Romney about the man he's been dating recently. "I guess I probably should have mentioned Elliot when Mitt and his staff talked to me last Friday," Ryan said to himself Monday, adding that it had only been a couple months since he and his boyfriend started dating exclusively and that the pair were still "in the fun, early phase" of the relationship. "I mean, we're not super serious at this point. We see each other a few times a week at most. I'm not ruling out something more meaningful down the road, but right now it's really not a big deal. " According to sources, despite his initial concern, Ryan relaxed after deciding that Romney would "absolutely love Elliot" when the two met at the Republican National Convention later this month.

Ryan Begins Attacking Romney's Record As Massachusetts Governor
DENVER — Displaying the tough no-nonsense talk and firm commitment to conservative principles that led to his selection as the Republican vice presidential candidate, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) has taken to the campaign trail and begun viciously attacking the record of running mate and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. Within hours of joining the GOP ticket Saturday, Ryan went on the offensive against the GOP candidate, and he has continued to cast him as a "pro-abortion crusader" and "shameless political chameleon" in stump speeches throughout Wisconsin, Iowa, and Colorado. At town hall meetings and fundraising events, Ryan has repeatedly referred to Romney's governorship as "disastrous," even going so far as to warn voters that the Republican candidate was an unreliable and dangerous choice for president. "Mitt Romney doesn't want you to know the disturbing truth about his record as governor," Ryan said at the Iowa State Fair yesterday, immediately displaying the sort of passionate conservatism that led to his selection by the Romney campaign. "But the facts are clear. Gov. Romney embraced the legalization of same-sex marriage, he imposed anti-business carbon-emission limits, and he championed efforts to limit Second Amendment rights. This isn't the record of strong family values and small government ideals that our country needs to get back on the road to prosperity — this is a record of ruin." Ryan also carried out his hard-hitting assault on the presumptive GOP nominee on numerous Sunday morning talk shows, leveling sharply worded broadsides against the individual health insurance mandate included in the governor's so-called Romneycare plan, which he blasted as "un-American" and claimed was "indisputably" the blueprint for Obamacare. Romney campaign staffers have expressed strong praise for Ryan's bold, direct rhetoric, noting that the Wisconsin congressman's determination and willingness to assail left-leaning policies head-on was precisely the reason they tapped him for the VP spot. "Paul is tenacious about the issues, and so far, true to form, he has gone after Romney like a bulldog," said Romney deputy campaign manager Katie Packer Gage, describing how Ryan immediately begins tearing into Romney's record as soon as he steps off the Romney campaign bus. "This is exactly what we brought him on to do: give a blunt, hard-nosed assessment of the facts and, if he sees hypocrisy or liberal waste, immediately shoot it down. He doesn't let anyone off the hook." She added, "We're just glad he's in our corner." According to pundits, crowds at campaign events have so far been very responsive to Ryan's message, and voters appear drawn to the Wisconsin representative's tough language and sharp challenges to Romney to "stand up and prove his conservative principles once and for all." Early polls indicate Ryan's strong language and vocal stance against Romney may already be winning over swing voters. "I really like what I'm hearing out of Congressman Ryan," said undecided voter Peter Garland of High Point, NC, adding that the vice presidential candidate's impassioned attack on Romney's previous policy positions would "definitely" help him make up his mind. "He really opened up my eyes about how Romney refused to sign an anti-tax pledge in 2002 and how the average tax burden actually increased in Massachusetts during his tenure. I have to say, I appreciate how Ryan calls it as he sees it, and that will certainly play a big role in my decision come November." By Tuesday, Ryan had broadened his attacks to Romney's character, noting that the former governor had thousands of documents from his tenure destroyed upon leaving office in 2007. According to a stone-faced Ryan, such "secretive, deceitful tactics" should leave voters with serious questions about Romney's fitness to lead the nation. "The bottom line is that there remain considerable doubts, not only about Gov. Romney's disturbingly liberal past, but also about his character and commitment to open, honest government," Ryan said of the man whose name flanks his own on countless lawn placards and bumper stickers. "My question to you is this: What is Mitt Romney hiding?" "Can we even trust this man?" the congressman added. "If you're a conservative values voter like me, then I'd have serious doubts."

ICE Agent Terrified After Becoming Separated From Team During Immigrant Raid
SIERRA VISTA, AZ — Looking around in a panic as he realized he had been left all alone, ICE agent Derek Borland was reportedly terrified Tuesday after becoming separated from his team during a raid on an immigrant community. "Where did everyone go? Guys, I'm really scared right now. Anyone? Bobby? Bobby, where are you?" said the frightened Borland, 41, who reportedly dashed through an apartment complex in a frantic effort to find his teammates and broke down in tears when he was unable to locate anyone he recognized. "Where did everyone go? Don't leave me alone here, I'm so scared. These guys are like my family — what if I never see them again? Anyone? Please, someone, help me!" At press time, the ICE agent was feeling much better after being reunited with his team and shoving an undocumented immigrant family into the back of a van.

Mitt Romney Frantically Running Around Ohio Smiling And Waving
CANTON, OH — As part of an effort to cut into President Obama's lead in the crucial swing state of Ohio, Mitt Romney reportedly ran at full speed Monday around the entire state screaming "Hello!" at the top of his lungs while smiling and waving indiscriminately. "Hello, Ohio! How ya doing? Hi! How is everybody? I'm Mitt Romney!" the breathless, sweat-drenched candidate spat out randomly as he tore across the state without pause, furiously kissing babies and tossing them backwards over his shoulder in a mad dash that has now taken him through 30 of Ohio's 88 counties. "The beautiful state of Ohio! Go Buckeyes! Jobs! Ohio! Hello! I'm Mitt Romney!" At press time, Romney had reportedly dived through the plate-glass front window of a North Canton bar, scrambled to his feet, wolfed down a large plate of pancakes, waved to restaurant patrons for five seconds, furiously stammered out a few words about the economy, stumbled out through the front door, and sprinted in the direction of Youngstown.

Romney Spends Most Of Factory Visit Yelling At Employees To Work Harder
NORTHFIELD, OH — Sources at the Gregson-Turner Paper Co. confirmed that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney spent the vast majority of his visit to the company's Ohio-based factory Tuesday yelling at employees to work harder. Romney, who said the stop was an essential part of his tour of America's manufacturing sector, arrived at the facility at approximately 10 a.m. and within minutes began mercilessly hounding workers throughout the plant to "get their acts together" and "start pounding out some paper, c'mon." "You people have been at work for nearly four hours and this is all you have to show for it? With all of this equipment? " a frustrated Romney reportedly shouted from the center of the factory while standing near several dozens crates of the day's completed paper supply. "What a truly pathetic performance. You guys better think about tightening things up around here fast, because what I'm seeing right now is completely unacceptable. "For God's sake, there should be 20 to 30 percent more paper out here! " Romney added. According to sources, the GOP candidate continually screamed at workers throughout the expansive paper mill to "stop slacking off," and in some cases even stood behind individual employees for as long as 15 minutes, loudly critiquing what he called the "unbelievable sloppiness" on display during every step of the paper's production cycle. "This is what they're paying you to do? " sources said Romney barked to a lone worker transferring large rags of cotton pulp into a metallic spinning cylinder. "You're just embarrassing yourself now, aren't you? For Christ's sake, put your back into it! God knows you'll be making this up in overtime. "And what the hell do you all think you're doing? " Romney then said to the room of workers now standing and staring at the scene. "Get back to work! Onlookers said the former Massachusetts governor later walked into the company's cafeteria and told workers on their lunch break that "10 minutes was more than enough time to eat a damned sandwich," coarsely reminding them that "the paper wasn't going to produce itself out there. The few employees who attempted to shake Romney's hand were quickly reprimanded by the candidate, who curtly told them to return to their jobs, telling them his visit was not "some sort of excuse to have a social hour. Sources said the former Massachusetts governor also provided several ideas for improving productivity at the facility, the majority of which, according to Romney, involved "trimming the fat" and "finally getting around to chucking out some of the dead weight around [the factory]." "Now, someone like you we can easily fire," Romney was overheard telling an employee removing paper bales from the mill's loading space. "How exactly are you essential? No, honestly, give me one good reason — just one — why you should have a paying job here. Because I look at you and all I see is a pink slip and an extra 25 grand a year that could be funneled somewhere else. "I'm telling you, I've seen machines do your job way, way faster and for free," added Romney, jutting a finger into the man's face. "Remember that. And wipe that stupid look off your face. According to company officials, Romney proceeded to outline how dozens of jobs across the paper mill were unnecessary, noting that terminations would be required because, while there were much-needed managerial roles to be filled, current employees "lacked even a basic education" and could not seriously be considered for them. "See, if I were in charge, I'd probably just move the entire plant to Taiwan and save us all a big chunk of change," Romney said. "It's stupid to overpay a massive, bloated staff like this when someone faster and younger can do all this overseas for a fraction of the price. That's just common business sense. You'd seriously have to be an idiot not to see that, but hey, maybe that's exactly what I'm dealing with here: idiots. "Thanks for all of your support again, guys," Romney added as he left the factory.

Would A Man Who Doesn't Support Women Let His Wife Pick Out Any Oven She Wants For Her Birthday?
During last night's town hall debate at Hofstra University, my opponent Mr. Obama made a number of false accusations about my political positions, but none more egregious than his claim that my policies are in some way a threat to American women. As he has throughout this long campaign season, the president charged that I'm not advocating enough for women's rights, that I'm ignoring the needs of hardworking mothers and daughters — in short, a litany of lies designed to convince undecided voters that I'm woefully indifferent to the needs of this country's women. So to Mr. Obama and all the undecided Americans out there, let me now ask you this simple question: Would a man who doesn't support women let his wife pick out any oven she wants for her birthday? Let me say it again: Would a man who's supposedly out-of-touch with the needs of today's women hand over his credit card to his wife for the day, say "here you go, honey," and let her buy whatever oven her heart desires? With a new set of cutlery to boot? My opponent would no doubt say, "Yeah, right. A man like Mitt Romney would never let his wife go to Sears.com and pick out any oven she wants, especially when there's nothing wrong with the one she already has." Well, I hate to break it to you, Mr. President, but that's exactly what I did. When Ann turned 63 this year, I gave her explicit permission to purchase any oven on the market. Green, brown, blue, brick, ceramic — it didn't matter to me, so long as Ann was happy and ran her final choice by me first. Now does that sound like a policy from someone who doesn't respect women? After all, the kitchen is her space. I call it "Ann's part of the house." Like millions of wives and mothers across America, she's a strong, independent woman who deserves every opportunity to grow and thrive without being told what to do in the privacy of her own home. That's why I let her decide everything about the kitchen: what color she wants to paint it, what food she wants to buy, what meals she wants to make. In fact, I make a point of never going in there if I can help it, especially if Ann is cooking or cleaning. I give her full rein over the whole kitchen. Who was it that let her decide where we went on vacation this year, and the year before that? Who was it that let her pick out almost all of my dress shirts? Who was it that said, "Sure, you can have your book club meeting at our house," even though it meant ceding the living room to 10 of her chattering friends for an entire night? That's right: me. Mitt Romney. So no one on this earth, neither the president nor his increasingly belligerent league of supporters, can accuse Mitt Romney of undermining the progress of women. If anyone can attest to my long record of inclusion and equality on women's issues, believe me, it's Ann Romney. Over the course of my campaign for the presidency, she's been there every step of the way, standing beside me at important speeches, helping me host fundraising events, and tagging along on various business trips. At the Republican National Convention in Florida this year, I even let her get up on stage and recite my policies in front of my supporters. That was a pretty big deal for her! And as someone who believes women can and do make valuable contributions to the workplace, I've made a point of including Ann in my professional life as well. When I was CEO of Bain Capital, I'd often invite her to the office — the very same office, mind you, where I conducted business with powerful men from all over the world — and let her file documents, or send some faxes off before a big meeting. Of course, I supervised her quite closely to make sure she did everything correctly, but that's only natural when money is on the line. As you might expect, she did a bang-up job! I even invited her back the next day to answer some phone calls. That's how much trust I put in Ann, and that's how much trust I put in women all across America. So as the election draws near and my opponent continues his unrelenting mission to distort my record on women's issues, I simply ask you to look at the relationships in my personal life, as those often speak louder than words. And I'm sure if Ann were allowed to talk about it, she would say the exact same thing. Mitt Romney

Romney Slowly Turning Into $100 Bill
TAMPA, FL — Campaign sources expressed concern today over Mitt Romney's green complexion, papery skin, and slowly flattening body frame, prompting increased speculation that the Republican presidential candidate has been gradually transforming into a $100 bill. Staff members said the Republican candidate — whose skin pigmentation has now been fully overtaken by optically variable ink and whose spinal column has slowly shifted into an outline of Philadelphia's Independence Hall — has been undergoing the transformation throughout the campaign and now more closely resembles a banknote than a human being. "When Mitt's skin began changing, everyone was worried he was suffering from some sort of strange health condition," said an anonymous Romney staffer, who went on to describe the loud crinkling noises the candidate now makes whenever he walks, and the potent smell of paper stock that has overwhelmed campaign headquarters since mid-April. "But when one of our aides noticed Benjamin Franklin's head starting to protrude from Gov. Romney's chest, it became clear that he was actually becoming money." "We're not really sure how or why this is happening, and Mitt himself has yet to acknowledge it," the source continued. "With that being said, he has to realize something's wrong. I mean, he clearly has the phrase 'federal reserve note' running straight down his face, for Christ's sake." The first signs of Romney's metamorphosis into the denomination of U.S. currency were reportedly observed during a November 2011 campaign stop in Alexandria, VA, when a mixture of black and green ink begin flowing out of the candidate's nose and ears. Aides said they became worried again later that month after spotting what initially appeared to be large, bold tattoos of serial codes and Timothy Geithner's signature on Romney's arms. Despite his visibly transitioning anatomy and biological structure, Romney has reportedly insisted on maintaining a full schedule of campaign appearances, already leading to numerous incidents in which the .0043-inch-thick candidate has been blown down the street or across the room by strong gusts of wind or ceiling fans. "I went to one of Gov. Romney's rallies last month, and when I tried shaking his hand, his whole arm just crumpled right there in my palm," said Boulder, CO resident and registered Republican Chris Stockwell. "I apologized, but he just kept smiling and told me not to worry about it. Then an aide came over and smoothed out the wrinkles, and Romney just continued making his way through the crowd." "The governor definitely looked like a $100 bill, though," Stockwell added. "And a brand-new, crisp one, too." While Romney's transformation has been met with confusion from the nation's medical community, many conservative pundits argue the candidate's transition into a living, breathing unit of currency only increases his viability as a political leader. "Gov. Romney is a businessman. That is how Americans have gotten to know him, and that is how they will primarily connect with him," said Collin Levy, a Wall Street Journal senior editorial writer. "The fact of the matter is, the economy is the most important issue in this election, so who better to lead the country in these difficult times than a $100 bill?" Addressing a crowd of supporters in Florida last Saturday, Romney briefly hinted at his physical condition and its impact on his campaign. "I want all my supporters to know that no matter how I look, no matter how I change, I am still the right leader for this country," said a fully green Romney, speaking to applauding supporters as black ink spewed from his mouth. "I promise you we will take back America and make it great again!" Shortly after leaving the stage, Romney reportedly paused briefly after catching his own reflection in a nearby mirror and quietly said, "Looking good."

Romney: 'This Is Why They Call Me Turnaround Mitty From Comeback City'
LEXINGTON, VA — Speaking at a rally on Monday, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney told supporters his dramatic resurgence in the polls following last week's debate had once again proved that he deserves his well-known moniker, Turnaround Mitty from Comeback City. "Since as far back as I can remember, folks have been calling me Turnaround Mitty from Comeback City, and just like in Detroit, Massachusetts, and Salt Lake, Turnaround Mitty from Comeback City has pulled through," said Romney, adding that "the ol' T.M.F.C.C. has struck again." "There were many who doubted me, but everyone on the Nitty-Gritty Mitty Committee knew that Turnaround Mitty from Comeback City would one day be sitting pretty." The candidate added that rebounds such as this one also explain why his close friends like to call him the Salt Lake Sultan of Surge.

Mitt Romney's Goal To Connect With One Voter By The Time This Is All Over
BELMONT, MA — While he is widely favored to win the Republican nomination for president next year, Mitt Romney told reporters Monday that deep down, what he truly wants is to actually establish a real, authentic connection with at least one voter before his campaign ends. The anguished former Massachusetts governor, who conceded many in his party will recognize him as their most electable candidate and vote for him only by default, said victory in the primaries will mean nothing to him if he remains incapable of energizing a single member of the American electorate. "I'm getting a lot of support just by virtue of being the Republican in the race most likely to beat Obama, and that's good, I guess," Romney said. "But I suppose I was hoping for a stronger, more emotional reaction from people. When this whole thing is over, all I really want is for one person to truly, earnestly believe in me — to look me in the eye as if to say, 'I'm with you, Mitt. You are great, and I am excited about you as a person and as a leader.' "There's got to be at least one, single individual out there who really, really wants me to be president, right? " he added. "Right?" Romney, an unsuccessful candidate for the 2008 Republican nomination, said that in recent months his town hall appearances and campaign rallies have served as constant distressing reminders of his inability to spark genuine enthusiasm among voters or form any kind of meaningful bond whatsoever. "Sure, some people cheer and wave signs, but it all seems so mechanical, like they're just going through the motions," Romney said. "Have you ever seen anyone at a Mitt Romney rally with tears streaming down their face? No, of course not. Has anyone ever spontaneously started a spirited 'Mitt, Mitt, Mitt' chant that I could spend a solid minute basking in before finally beginning my speech? No way. In fact, it's hard to even imagine it. Why is that? What am I doing wrong? I mean, I say inspirational stuff, don't I?" "I'm not asking for people to faint or go into hysterics or anything, but would it be too much for just one person to respond intensely and personally to who I am and what I stand for? " continued Romney, adding that he would even be thrilled to have a voter shout at him in anger, because then he would at least be able to say he had actually moved someone. "Frankly, I don't even care who it is — an elderly woman, a child, a mentally-ill person who just happens to be wandering through the rally. I am wide-open here. Sources confirmed Romney has directed his staff to conduct a nationwide door-to-door search to find at least one individual excited by his bid for the presidency, a massive undertaking he initiated upon realizing his own aides and volunteer workers had only joined his campaign after failing to find a more inspiring candidate to rally around. For his part, the presidential hopeful said he was making a concerted effort to maximize the potential for a meaningful moment in all public appearances. "Now, when I give a speech, I make eye- contact with just one person the whole time, trying to convince them I understand and share their hopes and their fears," said Romney, who has reportedly asked that his speechwriters redouble their efforts to craft soaring turns of phrase and convincing words of empathy. "I hold all my handshakes a little longer, squeeze them a little tighter. I'm even saluting little kids. If one of them ever salutes me back, I'm counting it as a deep, heartfelt connection. "Still, I can't say I blame anyone," Romney added with a sigh. "I look in the mirror every day, and I don't feel all that inspired, either.

'I Want To Congratulate The President,' Romney Says In 240,000th And Final Lie Of Campaign
BOSTON — While delivering his concession speech at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center Tuesday night, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney uttered the 240,000th and final lie of his 2012 campaign when he offered his "sincere congratulations" to President Barack Obama. "This has been a hard-fought and closely contested campaign, and while we've had our share of disagreements, there has always been a great deal of respect and admiration between myself and the president," said Romney, concluding 17 months' worth of manipulative falsehoods, half-truths, and outright fabrications with one last bald-faced lie. "Tonight, the American people made their voices heard. And now I urge every one of my supporters to set aside their differences with my opponent and join me in standing behind our president, so that we all may come together in a spirit of understanding and cooperation to build a better America." Romney then concluded his speech by expressing his thanks for the tireless efforts of his campaign team, marking the 12th and final true statement of his nearly six-year-long White House run.

Romney Proudly Explains How He's Turned Campaign Around
'I'm Lying More,' He Says BOSTON — For weeks many Beltway insiders had written off the Romney campaign as dead, saying the candidate had dug himself into too deep a hole with too little time to recover. However, with a month to go before ballots are cast, Romney has pulled even with President Obama, and the former Massachusetts governor credits his rejuvenated campaign to one, singular tactic: lying a lot. "I'm lying a lot more, and my lies are far more egregious than they've ever been," a smiling Romney told reporters while sitting in the back of his campaign bus, adding that when faced with a choice to either lie or tell the truth, he will more than likely lie. "It's a strategy that works because when I lie, I'm essentially telling people what they want to hear, and people really like hearing things they want to hear. Even if they sort of know that nothing I'm saying is true." "It's a freeing strategy, really, because I don't have to worry about facts or being accurate or having any concrete positions of any kind," Romney added. Romney said he is telling at least 80 percent more lies now than he was two months ago. Buoyed by his strong debate performance, which by his own admission included 40 or 50 instances of lying in one 90-minute period, the candidate said he will continue to "just openly lie [his] ass off" until the Nov. 6 election. Whether it's a senior citizen, military family, working mother, businessman, or middle-class American, Romney said, he will lie to every single one of them as often as he can if that's what it takes to win the presidency. "The best part is, it's really easy to lie," said Romney, who added that voicing whatever untruths come into his mind at any given moment is an easy thing to do because all it requires is opening his mouth and talking. "For example, if someone accuses me of having a tax plan that makes no discernible sense, I just lie and say that I do have a tax plan that makes sense. I also say there is a study that backs up my plan. See that? Simple. None of it is remotely true, of course, but now we're moving on to the next topic because people are usually too afraid to ask me straight up if I'm lying, because that is apparently not something you ask someone who is running for president." Moreover, Romney said, if anyone does accuse him of lying, he will simply say he is not lying, which he noted is just an extension of the overall strategy. "So, if I'm talking to retirees," Romney continued, "I lie and say I'll fight tooth and nail to save Medicare, which causes them to applaud. On the other hand, if I'm talking to the party base, I lie and say we have to cut Medicare, which causes them to applaud. So, you see, my goal here is to get everyone applauding for me, because if everyone is clapping their hands, standing on their feet, and shouting my name, that means they like me and will vote for me." Romney's campaign advisers said that they adopted the strategy of lying a lot after realizing several things: (1) Lying sounds good, especially when the truth sounds bad, (2) the American media doesn't care if you lie, (3) the American people don't care if you lie, and (4) it's okay to lie if you are very, very desperate to become the president of the United States. "If we're going to be carried into the White House, it's going to have to be on a wave of lies," Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades said. "Most important, Mitt is comfortable when he is lying because then he doesn't have to say anything bad. And in this last month it's important that we just let Mitt be Mitt, whoever the hell that is." "It's late in the game, but this campaign has finally found its groove," Rhoades added. "And that groove is lying. Bald-faced, make-no-apologies, dirty, filthy lying." According to Romney, amidst all the lies, there is only one thing that remains true. "I literally have no clue where I stand on any single issue at this point," said Romney, adding that when it comes to women's rights, gay rights, health care, the middle class, the economy, or the U.S. military, all he knows is how to lie about them. "I understand what other people want. And what I've learned, especially in the past week, is that in order to be a viable candidate for the White House, that's all you really need to know." Following the interview, Romney told various reporters that, if elected, he would save the newspaper industry.

Entire Republican National Convention Stunned As Ann Romney Asks For Divorce
TAMPA, FL — Ann Romney shocked the crowd at the Tampa Bay Times Forum into silence Tuesday, announcing during her remarks to the Republican National Convention that she plans to divorce her husband of 43 years, whom the party had just nominated for president of the United States. "Good evening and welcome! I want to use this opportunity to talk about my husband Mitt and ask him for a divorce," said Romney, who sources confirmed received two seconds of applause before the audience processed what she had actually said. "Mitt Romney is fiscally strong, he has a great vision for this country's future, and I'm requesting a very substantial figure in alimony. I strongly feel this is what's best, both for me and for our family, and my decision is final. If he wants to discuss the matter further he can contact my attorney." Following the speech, a beaming Mitt Romney reportedly walked across the stage, took the microphone from Ann, and asked the crowd, "Wasn't she great, everybody?" to continued silence.

Mitt Romney Soars In Polls After Leaving Country
WASHINGTON — According to a newly released USA Today/Gallup poll, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's favorability has surged to 64 percent since he left the country Wednesday for a three-nation overseas trip. "Once Gov. Romney was no longer within the borders of the United States and was instead many thousands of miles away from American voters, his popularity immediately spiked across almost all demographics," said political analyst Mark Halperin, noting that the electorate has been invigorated by Romney's complete absence from campaign events, rallies, and town hall meetings. "It seems that the farther away Romney travels, the more people like him. By the time his plane touches down in Israel, I wouldn't be surprised if his favorability rating isn't somewhere in the high 70s." Experts were quick to note the number remains well below Romney's historical high of 89 percent, reached in February 2008 when the former Massachusetts governor announced his withdrawal from that year's presidential race.

Romney Receives 20-Minute Standing Ovation At NAAWP Event
HOUSTON — During an address Wednesday to the National Association for the Advancement of White People, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney received a lengthy standing ovation from the group of 2,000 Caucasians who had gathered to hear him speak. The NAAWP, a 400-year-old organization with a membership of nearly 8 million whites nationwide, is expected to be firmly in Romney's camp come November. "Thank you, thank you so much," said Romney, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by wave after wave of raucous applause and numerous chants of "We love Mitt!" "I love you, too. Really, this is too much. " Romney's reception came in stark contrast to the welcome given to President Barack Obama, who spoke to the NAAWP last Thursday and was loudly booed for saying, "Hello, thanks for having me.

Cash-Strapped NRA Forced To Shoot Dozens Of Redundant Employees
FAIRFAX, VA — Claiming its finances are in peril following regulatory actions by the State of New York, the National Rifle Association told staff members Tuesday it has been forced to cut operational costs by shooting dozens of the gun advocacy group's redundant employees. "Faced with difficult financial realities, we will be moving forward without several of our key team members, whom we have had no choice but to gun down with bullets to the back of the head," Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre wrote in an all-staff email, explaining the recently departed employees were each blindsided by the butt of an AR-15, dragged into their supervisor's office, and told they would be given a generous five-second head start before HR representatives opened fire. "While we will miss coming into work every day and seeing their faces, which have been blown to bits and are no longer recognizable, we have a mandate to ensure the long-term survival of this organization, and once we've finished cleaning up all the blood and brain matter and skull fragments, we must commit ourselves to working harder than ever to fulfill our mission." LaPierre went on to praise the NRA's voluntary execution package, which entitles a killed-off employee's family to temporary health benefits and an urn holding the cremated remains of their loved one.

NRA Says Parkland Students Should Be Grateful For Guns Giving Them Such A Memorable Bonding Experience
FAIRFAX, VA — Reminding them to appreciate the lifetime of memories they will never forget, the National Rifle Association announced Monday that Parkland students should be grateful to guns for giving them such an unforgettable bonding experience. "These protesting students should be thankful to guns for an exciting adventure where they've made lots of great new friends," said NRA President Wayne LaPierre, who explained that firearms provided the Parkland students with a community of like-minded people who they could hang out with, as well as plenty of fresh air and exercise they might not have gotten otherwise. "You've met all kinds of exciting new chums, you've gone on a trip to Washington, D.C., and you have an amazing story you can tell your grandkids, all because of guns. You should count yourself lucky that guns brought you together with classmates you might never have talked to before, because students in countries with more strict gun laws will never experience that kind of deep connection." LaPierre added that the students could show a little respect and gratitude for what happened by donating to their local chapter of the NRA.

Tim Duncan Around If Any Spurs Have Questions About Sequester
SAN ANTONIO — Stressing that it is a "very complicated socioeconomic issue," Spurs power forward Tim Duncan reportedly urged teammates Thursday to come to him with any questions or concerns they may have about the automatic federal spending cuts enacted by the ongoing government sequester. "You might not think it affects you guys, but San Antonio's transportation infrastructure has already taken a hit due to forced staffing cuts, not to mention the potential $67 million loss of education funding," said the three-time NBA Finals MVP, who recently sent the team a mass e-mail with a comprehensive breakdown of the $85 billion in cuts at both the federal and statewide level. "I'll be around after practice, and if anything comes up later or you'd prefer to talk one-on-one, feel free to call me at home. I also have some additional literature on the subject, including Bob Woodward's controversial The Price Of Politics, if you're interested in reading up on sequestration yourself." At press time, Duncan was e-mailing his local congressmen to suggest a $55 billion reduction in defense spending and a 4 percent tax increase on adjusted gross incomes over $5 million in order to balance the budget.

U.S. Flag Recalled After Causing 143 Million Deaths
WASHINGTON — Citing a series of fatal malfunctions dating back to 1777, flag manufacturer Annin & Company announced Monday that it would be recalling all makes and models of its popular American flag from both foreign and domestic markets. Representatives from the nation's leading flag producer claimed that as many as 143 million deaths in the past two centuries can be attributed directly to the faulty U.S. models, which have been utilized extensively since the 18th century in sectors as diverse as government, the military, and public education. "It has come to our attention that, due to the inherent risks and hazards it poses, the American flag is simply unfit for general use," said Annin & Company president Ronald Burman, who confirmed that the number of flag-related deaths had noticeably spiked since 2003. "I would like to strongly urge all U.S. citizens: If you have an American flag hanging in your home or place of business, please discontinue using it immediately. Added Burman, "The last thing we would want is for more innocent men and women around the world to die because of our product. Millions of U.S. flag–related injuries and fatalities have been reported over a 230-year period in locations as far flung as Europe, Cuba, Korea, Gettysburg, PA, the Philippines, and Iraq. In addition, the company found that U.S. flag exports to Vietnam during the late 1960s and early 1970s resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, a clear sign that there was something seriously wrong with its product. Despite fears about the flag's safety — especially when improperly used or manipulated in ways not originally intended — sales continued unabated over the years, potentially putting billions of unsuspecting people in danger. "At first, we wanted one of our flags in every home in America," Burman said. "Unfortunately, the practical applications of this product are far outnumbered by the risks it presents. Millions have died needlessly, and when you ask people why, they point to the flag. Added Burman, "Frankly, we should have pulled it off the market decades ago. Studies conducted by the Annin & Company research and development department revealed that faulty U.S. flags have caused more than just injuries and deaths. During the mid-1950s, the flags were found to have the bizarre side effect of causing fear, paranoia, and hysterical behavior among millions of Americans. This was dismissed as an isolated event until September 2001, when similar symptoms reemerged on a massive scale. As hazardous as the flags may be on their own, Annin & Company officials claimed the products become even more dangerous when used in conjunction with other common household items. "When combined with alcohol, excessive patriotism, grief, or well-intentioned but ultimately misguided ideals, U.S. flags transform into ticking time bombs, just waiting to go off," Burman said. Manufacturers are addressing the flag's unsafe and potentially lethal alignment of stars and stripes by designing a revised model that they hope will cut down on deaths in the United States and overseas, where experts say the flag is nearly 1,000 times as deadly. In the meantime, Annin & Company is advising all Americans to either ship their flags back to the manufacturer or, if no time permits, dispose of them in an efficient manner. "I understand that people might be reluctant to stop using a product they have found to be reliable over the years," Burman told reporters. "But I can't in good conscience allow them to use something I know to be dangerous. We'll try to make adjustments soon and come up with something that benefits everybody rather than hurting them. Added Burman, "In the interim, I would recommend that all Americans switch to the Canadian flag, which seems to be working just fine.

Tim Duncan Argues Theory Of Infinite Divisibility Prevents Any Team From Winning Championship
MIAMI — Applying an analytical framework dating back to 360 BC, Spurs power forward Tim Duncan used the concept of infinite divisibility Thursday to argue that, in theory, no team could win the NBA championship. "Given that an initial field of nonzero size is halved by each round of playoffs, it follows that one may make an arbitrarily large number of such divisions, each time yielding another field of nonzero size," said Duncan, diagramming his arguments in marker on a dry-erase board for his teammates. "Imagine, if you will, a basketball approaching a backboard from 8 feet, then 4 feet, then 2 feet, and so on. Now ask: When is the ball halfway there? This is my point: that the ball is always halfway there, and continues to be so. I know this is all very abstract, but you understand what I'm saying. The NBA playoffs behave asymptotically, approaching a zero limit but never reaching it." Duncan then asserted that, assuming the dimension of time is similarly divisible, tonight's Game 1 tip-off would never occur.

Tim Duncan Busy At San Antonio Zoning Office Planning Spurs Championship Parade Route
SAN ANTONIO — Having already filed a special event permit application with the city government, sources confirmed Tuesday that Spurs power forward Tim Duncan has been working diligently at the San Antonio zoning office to finalize the route of the team's upcoming NBA championship parade. "We're going to have a huge turnout tomorrow, so we should cordon off designated standing areas to ensure that traffic isn't obstructed heading downtown," Duncan reportedly said while poring over a large map of the city, estimating that roughly 500 4-foot-tall barricades would be required to ensure fan safety along the parade route. "I'm fine with allowing spectators near Rivercenter Mall, but only if we set up first aid tents and mark clear walking paths toward restroom facilities and street exits. The 2005 parade actually caused quite a bit of congestion on Market Street, so we should do our best to avoid any similar headaches this year." At press time, Duncan was composing a lengthy email to teammates reminding them not to bring any glass containers or alcoholic beverages with them, as such items will not be permitted at the parade.

Puppy Bowl Overshadowed By League's Rampant Heartworm Pill Abuse
NEW YORK — As evidence mounts linking unregulated usage of the prescription medication to a variety of degenerative health issues, sources confirmed Sunday that Puppy Bowl XI is being increasingly overshadowed by the league's rampant heartworm pill abuse. "The debilitating long-term effects of heartworm pills on puppies who abused them in their playing days are unfortunately only beginning to be understood," said Slate editor Anthony Isaacson, adding that the intense buildup for this year's Puppy Bowl falls against the backdrop of 14-week-old star labrador Bailey having been recently rushed to an animal hospital after being discovered in his dog bed severely vomiting and suffering convulsions from an apparent overdose of Heartgard Plus. "Puppies are often supplied heartworm pills by team veterinarians without any regard to the potential future health hazards down the road when they are 4 or 5 years old. Puppy football may be the country's most adorable sport, but people must realize that it can be an ugly one as well." Reached for comment, Animal Planet representatives refused to respond to allegations of widespread heartworm pill use, only stating that Puppy Bowl XI is "poised to be one of the cutest Puppy Bowls of all time."

Tim Duncan Encourages Teammates To Be Fathers First, Basketball Players Second
SAN ANTONIO — In an effort to inspire the team before Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals, Spurs captain Tim Duncan reportedly reminded his teammates Friday to always put their duties as fathers before their jobs as basketball players. "What you do on this court is nothing compared to what you do at home for your children," said Duncan, adding that what this country lacks most is not basketball players but mature men. "The playoffs end in June, but the responsibilities of fatherhood? Those are year-round. Guys, it doesn't matter if you score 10,000 points or win three NBA championships — spending time with your kids: that's the championship. This is just a game, after all." Duncan then referred his teammates to a study showing that children with absent fathers were more likely to have behavioral problems than those whose fathers were present and involved in their lives.

"I've pinned the San Antonio Spurs under my Sparks, and you should too as soon as you've set up your profiles. And, also, guys, please switch out your old Comcast and Earthlink email accounts for new GMail ones so we can communicate easier via Google Groups." As of press time, no Spurs player has entered Duncan's current Google+ Hangout.

FDA Deems Genetically Modified Salmon Too Handsome To Eat
WASHINGTON — Following months of analysis into the animal's stunning good looks, the Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that genetically modified salmon are far too handsome to eat. "After several rounds of clinical testing, we have determined that these genetically altered fish are safe for human consumption, but between their striking, rugged good looks and the air of devil-may-care competence they exude, no one should want to eat them," said FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, particularly noting how the engineered salmons' pouty lips and lustrous silver-blue sheen masked a deep, instinctual desire to swim upstream and spawn like the intertidal bad boys they are. "These salmon may be raised for greater immunity to waterborne pathogens and to produce higher levels of Omega 3 fatty acids than their wild counterparts, but between their supple, hunky bodies and those eyes — These salmon are farmed and dangerous, honey. Therefore, the FDA cannot recommend them for human consumption at this time." Gottlieb further warned that no amount of genetic manipulation could take a fish away from its true nature and that handsome or not, salmon would never be as kind-hearted as trout.

Tony Romo Practicing For First Time Since Surgery To Remove Ovarian Cyst
OXNARD, CA — According to sources inside the Dallas Cowboys training staff, quarterback Tony Romo returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time since undergoing surgery to remove a painful ovarian cyst. "Tony appears to have responded well to the procedure, and given the rate at which his ovarian cyst was growing, I'm glad we got in there when we did," said Dr. Peter Baskin, who removed the four inch fluid-filled sac after the signal-caller reported constant abdominal discomfort during voluntary OTA's. "If we had waited any longer, it very well could have spread to his uterus. Hopefully Tony can still have children." Baskin told reporters that there will most likely be some scarring along the fallopian tubes, but Romo's range of motion should remained unaffected.

Nation Taking No Joy In Cowboys' Pathetic Collapse
'Actually, Never Mind, It's Really Fun,' Reports Populace IRVING, TX — As the Dallas Cowboys struggle with a 1-6 season, sports fans nationwide have been saddened by the bad fortune that has befallen the franchise long revered as one of the NFL's crown jewels, and known throughout the football world as America's Team. Actually, the U.S. populace immediately confirmed, the Cowboys' pathetic collapse has brought with it nothing but pure joy and happiness. "It's really been tough to watch, especially for a team that had so much potential heading into the season," Appleton, WI shopkeeper and longtime Packers fan Erik Hoyer said. "Ha! I was almost able to say that with a straight face. Honestly, this Cowboys team has made watching football more fun than it's been in years. They can't run the ball, they can't defend anything, and they're imploding so bad that their owner doesn't even know how many games they've played. "I can't think of a better team for this to happen to," he added. "I literally can't stop smiling. According to the American people, to think that the Cowboys — an organization that has been synonymous with excellence for decades — have fallen to last place in their conference and all but come apart at the seams has been very difficult. That is, the nation explained, if the definition of "difficult" involves loving life more than ever, especially when thinking about how the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the team at Cowboys Stadium in front of 80,000 loud and insufferable fans. Disappointed citizens — who explained that they were not so much disappointed as they were elated and filled with a renewed sense of justice in the universe — said the real icing on the cake is thinking about how upset the entire city of Dallas will be this February when hosting a Super Bowl that does not include the Cowboys. "You know, I thought I would really enjoy something like this, but a football season doesn't feel like a season if the Cowboys don't have a chance at making the playoffs," New York Giants fan and banker David McQuillan said. "That said, would any of you like to watch six hours of highlights from all the Cowboys' losses? I've saved them all on my DVR, because sometimes when I'm having a tough time at work I watch the Giants 41-35 victory and the look on Wade Phillips' dumb face just cheers me right up. "Man, I'm going to love when that guy gets fired," McQuillan continued. "It's going to be so sweet I can taste it. Like the Yankees in baseball, the Cowboys are known throughout the country as a team that prides itself on excellence, a team that has come to embody its sport. And when star quarterback Tony Romo went down with a clavicle injury several weeks ago, the disappointment could be felt from coast-to-coast. "Hearing Romo scream when his collarbone snapped will always be one of my favorite memories," Washington, D.C. resident Nick Thomason said. "I was pretty young when Dallas went 1-15 in 1989, but I still remember their only win that year was against my Redskins. It's like the football gods were repaying me by making sure he was miked up during that game. "I thought I would cherish the day when the Cowboys completely imploded," 44-year-old James Tolliver of Providence, RI said. "And I was right. This has been absolutely wonderful. According to a recent USA Today poll, 45 percent of the country said that no team deserves to perform this terribly under this much pressure, except for the Dallas Cowboys. Thirty-two percent said that the season has been emotionally taxing for people who grew up worshipping Roger Staubach, Troy Aikman, and Emmitt Smith, and that those people should probably go fuck themselves anyway. Ninety-nine percent of respondents said that if karma has caught up with the Cowboys, and they are finally getting payback for all the times Michael Irvin pushed off and was never called for it, or all the years they mysteriously never played an away game in December, then karma is the greatest thing in the history of the world. "Firing the coach, hiring a new coach, players wanting to be traded, Romo's toughness questioned in the locker room — there are going to be some amazing meltdowns coming, mark my words," said lifelong Dallas resident Stephen Lowndes, who has been steeped in Cowboys lore all his life without being asked if that was what he wanted. "Plus, they're about due for a major drug incident, or maybe a strip-club brawl or something, just to make the season perfect. And months down the road, long after they miss the playoffs, they get to screw up the draft. Really, you have to grow up getting this team rammed down your throat every single fucking minute of every single goddamn day of your life to appreciate how much I'm loving this. "Seriously, best season ever," Lowndes added. "How 'bout them Cowboys!"

Smart, Qualified People Behind The Scenes Keeping America Safe: 'We Don't Exist'
WASHINGTON — Members of the brilliant, highly trained, and dedicated team of elite professionals who work tirelessly behind the scenes to protect our nation and keep its citizens out of harm's way announced Tuesday that they do not exist. "I know most Americans like to believe there are selfless, ultra-intelligent operatives like me out there watching over everything from an underground control room," said the Rhodes Scholar Navy SEAL national security official who for the past 10 years we have all mistakenly presumed to be an actual human being. "Unfortunately, though, I'm not employed by the U.S. government, I'm not working at all hours to foil terrorist plots, nor am I part of some secret network of sharp, capable agents, because no such network exists. "And again, neither do I," the imaginary man added. According to the utterly nonexistent super-geniuses who we've been telling ourselves are keeping our nation safe with their superior technology and lightning-fast decision-making abilities, there are currently no living people who resemble them at the Pentagon, CIA, FBI, DHS, TSA, or any other federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and there never really have been at any point in American history. Fictitious sources also confirmed that the so-called "masterminds" behind our country's security and strategic defense are in fact people of moderate to reasonably above-average intelligence just like us who perform their jobs with more or less the same degree of competence and zeal as any regular person with a job would. "Obviously, it would be very comforting, and pretty cool, if there were stealth groups of resourceful, naturally gifted secret agents like me scouring the planet, rooting out terrorist sleeper cells, and tracking down Osama bin Laden," said a multilingual computer/ explosives/espionage expert who most Americans actually believe is a real guy out there. "I'm not denying that would be amazing; my only point is that it just isn't true. "Believe me, I wish I existed, too," the fake man added. "I would probably be great. Following the announcement, reporters learned that the all-seeing satellite cameras and invisible eyes that millions of Americans assume are diligently watching every square-inch of the country like a silent sentinel are either not up there at all, or are being monitored by a tired, modestly educated man reading Road & Track magazine in a tiny office. And, despite the widely held belief in some sort of all-knowing superagency that secretly controls all the other intelligence branches from above, attempts by reporters to contact such an agency were unsuccessful, as there is no way this is actually a thing. "Look, I understand your psychological need to invent someone like me so that you can stop worrying about imminent disasters and get some sleep at night," said the hyper-articulate, Princeton-educated political-scientist jujitsu-master we're all imagining. "But the reality is most of the smart, qualified people in this country are wasting away in assistant professorships at struggling public universities or making millions of dollars in some venture capital group. In fact, that's exactly the kind of job I would have right now if I were a real person. Which I'm not. "But good luck with everything," he added, or rather didn't add, because he neither said anything nor even ever existed at all. In response to the announcement, members of the actual team of government workers in charge of keeping our country safe each day sought to reassure the American people that the nation's welfare is in good hands. "Oh, yeah, don't worry about it," said the underpaid 28-year-old GED recipient who makes you take off your shoes and throw away your water bottle before you get on an airplane. "We got all kinds of crazy computers and shit to monitor things, so there's no way anything can go wrong. We got you covered.

Obama Outfitted With 238 Motion Capture Sensors For 3-D Record Of Presidency
WASHINGTON — In what is being hailed as a breakthrough in the field of historical record-keeping, the National Archives announced Monday that it would immediately begin outfitting Barack Obama's chest, limbs, and face with an array of motion capture sensors for use in preserving a 3-D account of his time as president. "The presidency of Mr. Obama is truly a landmark event, and I can think of no better way to honor it than with this $2.5 billion advanced digital-imaging project," acting archivist Adrienne Thomas told reporters. "Not only will our sensors provide unprecedented moment-to-moment documentation of a sitting U.S. president, but they will also give the American people the breathtaking realism and seamless layer animation they have come to expect. According to sources at the National Archives, Obama will spend the next four years in a custom-made, lycra-and-neoprene bodysuit, featuring 238 reflective "marker balls," which will instantly relay trillions of bytes of information to a central computer in Centennial, CO. Designers at the motion capture firm Vicon Motion Systems will then use this information to build a lifelike 3-D wire-frame model of the nation's 44th president, before digitally "painting" over the structure with computer-generated skin, hair, and clothes. The data will be stored on a hard drive at the National Archives, where curators will employ it as a complete record of Obama's tenure in office. "Our 78-person team is committed to capturing each and every nuance of the Obama administration," Vicon CEO Douglas Reinke said. "Years from now, historians will be able to access high-quality images of what the former president might have looked like while he was, say, meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on April 3, 2009, or tying his shoelaces on the afternoon of June 3, 2011." Added Reinke, "It's like actually watching the presidency unfold. Reinke explained that Obama will be required to wear the motion capture device at all times during his presidency, barring a few minutes each day to shower and change into a fresh bodysuit. In addition, the president has been instructed to refrain from performing any activities that might cause the sensors to malfunction, such as running, breathing heavily, or letting his core temperature rise above 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Sources at Vicon also confirmed that members of Obama's Secret Service detail will have to carry a large green-screen background behind the president at all times. "We will extend our full cooperation to the people at Vicon in order to make this 3-D record a reality," White House press secretary Robert Gibbs rold reporters Monday. "Nothing is more important to us than preserving this moment in history at 120 frames per second, with perfect surface anatomy, and total texture definition. Many scholars have also praised a feature of the motion capture technology that would allow future generations to digitally alter the president's wire-frame model by retroactively modifying clothing, facial features, skin tone, and even accessories. "Imagine being able to see what it might have looked like had Obama been wearing a bow tie when he delivered his first State of the Union address," American historian Joseph Ellis said. "Or if he'd been sporting a luxurious mustache while sitting down with the prime minister of Japan. The possibilities for customization are endless. Despite the unprecedented level of access the motion capture suit provides, a number of firms are pursuing additional technologies that might lead to even more precise records. Such proposals include a miniature camera that could be placed down Obama's throat to keep track of his exact food and drink intake, and a small microphone that could be inserted in the president's inner ear to pick up the sound of him humming or any low-level mumbling he might emit while in office. "In a perfect world, we would like to have a record of every single physical detail of Obama's historic presidency, down to even the most minute anatomical processes," said Stephen Dunkin of Mycore Electronics, which is currently developing a device that will retrieve and store any dead skin that Obama may shed during the course of his presidency. "But unfortunately, we're just going to have to accept the fact that, with the technology we have now, certain details will simply be lost to the sands of time. The president himself was unable to be reached for comment on the new technology because he and his staff were still busy trying to figure out a way for him to sit down.

Exclusive TSA Pre-Check Allows Passengers To Fly Without Waiting For Airplane
ARLINGTON, VA — Saying the program will drastically cut wait times for those who qualify, the Transportation Security Administration on Thursday introduced an exclusive new pre-check membership that permits travelers who pass a background check and pay a fee to fly without waiting for an airplane. "For years, TSA pre-check has allowed fliers to bypass long security lines, but with our latest program, eligible U.S. citizens can also avoid the many hassles and delays of planes at the airport," said TSA spokesperson Grant Scott, adding that members will no longer have to endure the long waits associated with boarding a commercial aircraft, taking off, the flight time itself, landing, and deplaning. "For a fee of $200, any traveler determined to be a low risk will now be able to proceed directly from the security line to their gate, through the jet bridge, and on to their destination without any hindrance whatsoever. No more planes, and no more delays caused by mechanical problems or the weather. Plus, your membership is good for five years." At press time, sources confirmed several members of the new pre-check program had taken to social media to complain about the wait times they faced upon arrival on the tarmac.

'Sir, You Stated You Wanted To Modernize The Grinch For Today's Audience,' Says New CNN Entertainment Reporter Jim Acosta
LOS ANGELES — In a heated exchange during a contentious press conference, new CNN entertainment reporter Jim Acosta pressed film directors Scott Mosier and Yarrow Cheney Thursday on an earlier statement they had made concerning their desire to modernize the Grinch for today's audience. "Sir, you're on record stating that — sir! Sir! Let me finish — you're on record stating that you wanted to update the franchise for 2018 despite the fact that the past installments hold up well," said Acosta to the two filmmakers he accused of being deliberately evasive, frequently interrupting them as they tried to change the subject by discussing what it was like to work with Benedict Cumberbatch. "Let me finish. Let me finish. Answer me: Did you or did you not try to put a new spin on the classic Christmas tale? The nation needs answers." At press time, Universal Pictures had banned Acosta from doing any press interviews for their film.

Disappointing: Microsoft Confirmed That Project Scarlett Is Actually Just A Brothel They're Building In Thailand Where Xboxes Can Go To Be Pleasured
If you're an Xbox fanboy who was salivating over what the next gen could offer, you might want to sit down because we have disappointing news coming from the X019 press event: Microsoft just confirmed that Project Scarlett is actually just an expansive brothel they're constructing in Thailand where Xboxes can go to be pleasured. While being able to send your past Xbox models to the Bangkok suburb of Nonthaburi for an erotic weekend to have their ports fingered and optical drive whipped definitely sounds like a nice perk, we can't help but feel this is going to be a huge blow for anyone looking to the next-gen for the latest and greatest in graphics and gameplay. "What we're offering with Project Scarlett is an all-inclusive package of sexual fulfillment and exotic excitement for any of our consoles at the hands of some absolutely beautiful Thai escorts," said Microsoft executive vice president Phil Spencer, explaining that all fans need to do is ship their Xbox, Xbox 360, or Xbox One to Project Scarlett in southern Thailand to guarantee them several nights of unforgettable pleasures amidst the sultry South Asian scents of freshly cracked coconuts and Ratchaphruek blossoms. "Men, women — whatever your Xbox needs, we can deliver on that at Project Scarlett. We have a highly trained team that knows how to deliver on even the kinkiest erotic fantasies." "All your console has to do is kick back with a lychee cocktail while a consort with a palm frond guides them into an unforgettable experience," he added. Spencer went on to present in-depth blueprints for the 3,000-square-foot bordello, describing an array of custom-made lotions, oils, and chains that will be employed to service the consoles when the complex opens during the 2020 holiday season. Thankfully, Microsoft has guaranteed that there will be regular testing in place to ensure no Xbox is returned to its users with a virus, but this does little to dispel industry concerns about whether Project Scarlett might violate local or international law. Obviously, Microsoft is betting big on the sexual tourism industry being the next big step for the Xbox brand. Still, we can't help but worry that abstaining from the upcoming generation with Project Scarlett might be a huge letdown for any gamers hoping to see Halo or Gears of War running on truly next-generation hardware.

Area Woman Emotionally Invested In Jennifer Aniston's Well-Being
SCOTTDALE, PA — Pennsylvania native and entertainment-news consumer Gayle Caudill admitted to a deep personal investment in the happiness and well-being of TV and film star Jennifer Aniston, an international celebrity who has a reported net worth of $80 million, and, according to Caudill, is "a down-to-earth gal just like myself. "She's had her share of troubles, like anyone else," said Caudill, referring to Aniston's much-reported divorce from fellow megastar Brad Pitt. "But if I know Jen Aniston, she'll come out on top. She's a survivor. The divorced 41-year-old dental-office receptionist and self-proclaimed "Team Aniston" member said she felt an "uncanny" bond with the $8-million-per-picture superstar. The two have never met, and are not expected to. "After hearing and reading what she's gone through these past two years, she almost seems like a little sister to me," said Caudill of Aniston — or "Jen," as she calls her — whose decision to pursue a high-profile acting career was made entirely without Caudill's input, as was Aniston's airing of the intimate details of her personal life that incurred Caudill's sympathy in the first place. "Jen's had such a hard time. I just want to hug her and tell her everything's okay. Caudill said that a major factor behind her allegiance towards Aniston, who topped People Magazine's 2006 Best Dressed list and was GQ Magazine's first-ever Woman Of The Year in 2005, was that the star "always faces her hardships with dignity. " But Caudill sympathizes strongly with Aniston mostly because of the Emmy Award–winning actress' underdog status. "Her marriage ended and people knock her for being more famous for her hairdos than her acting ability — yet she always bounces back," Caudill said. "When something happens to me, like when I get stood up on a date or my purse clasp breaks, I try to tell myself, 'Well, if Jen can survive getting dumped by Brad…'" One item of particular concern to Caudill is the "misconception" that Aniston, despite her memorable decade-long success as Rachel Green on Friends, hasn't fully pulled off the move from TV to the big screen. "That's so unfair to all that Jen has accomplished — she's so talented at both comedy and drama," said Caudill, who herself has been bypassed for promotion twice. "Have you seen Rumor Has It? The chemistry between Jen and Kevin Costner was just terrific. "People ask if she's going to be a bona fide movie star? I say she already is," Caudill said. Caudill admitted that she sometimes worries that Aniston is not eating enough. "Jen doesn't seem like the type to worry about her weight, but still, it's Hollywood," she said. "She doesn't need the stress, and she sure as heck doesn't need to be dealing with an eating disorder. " Caudill's worries were put at ease, however, when Aniston admitted on Access Hollywood that she "eats like a hog" on set, and hardly has time to exercise when she is working. "How can you not love this girl? " said Caudill, whose rent, credit card, and auto payments prevent her from converting her basement into a state-of-the-art workout facility, hiring a personal trainer, and making sure that her dietician suggests meals with the correct proportion of lean proteins and healthy carbohydrates. "Jen's just dealing with the same stuff all single working women deal with. Caudill said she particularly admired Aniston for seemingly "not giving up on love" by pursuing a relationship with actor Vince Vaughn. Though Caudill doesn't believe that their romance will result in marriage, she is grateful that Aniston is "seeing somebody who makes her happy," as evidenced by a picture she recently viewed in Star Magazine of the couple laughing together on a beach. Caudill, however, was disappointed when she found out Vaughn was a smoker, saying she herself could never date a man who smokes, and was "a little let down" when she saw paparazzi photos revealing that Aniston smoked herself. Nevertheless, she maintained that Aniston has been an "inspiring example" in her life. Caudill remained a consistent 30 pounds overweight despite experimenting with numerous diets, and is currently dating a Scottsdale–area man who, despite being a nonsmoker, shows little interest in her and still privately yearns to reconcile with his ex-wife. Caudill said she plans to maintain a close relationship with the actress "through thick and thin. "Jen's been through a lot," Caudill said. "But she'll come through in the end. Just like we all will, if we believe in ourselves and stick to our dreams.

Teach For America Chews Up, Spits Out Another Ethnic-Studies Major
NEW YORK — Teach For America, a national program that recruits recent college graduates to teach in low-income rural and urban communities, has devoured another ethnic-studies major, 24-year-old Andy Cuellen reported Tuesday. "Look, the world is a miserable place," said Cuellen, a Dartmouth graduate who quit the TFA program Monday morning. "All people — even children — are just nasty animals trying to secure their share of the food supply. I don't care how poor or how rich you are, that's just a fact. I'm sorry, but I have better things to do than zoo-keep for peanuts. Just one of the 12,000 young people TFA has burned through since 1990, Cuellen was given five weeks of training the summer before he took over a classroom at P.S. 83 in the South Bronx last September. "I walked into that school actually thinking I could make a difference," said Cuellen, who taught an overflowing class of disadvantaged 8-year-olds. "It was trial by fire. But after five months spent in a stuffy, dark room where the chalkboard fell off the wall every two days, corralling screaming kids into broken desks, I'm burnt to a crisp. Cuellen said his TFA experience "taught him a lot about hopelessness. "The cities are fucked. The suburbs are fucked. The whole country is fucked," Cuellen said. "And there's not a goddamned thing you or anyone can do about it. Anyone who says otherwise is selling something. Or trying to get you to teach kids math. According to Dartmouth literature, as a member of the ethnic-studies department, Cuellen learned "to empower students of color to move beyond being objects of study toward being subjects of their own social realities, with voices of their own. Teach For America executive director Theo Anderson called ethnic-studies departments "a prime source of fodder. "Oh, I'd say we burn through a hundred or so ethnic-studies majors each year," said Anderson, pointing to a series of charts showing the college-major breakdown of TFA corps members. "They tend to last a little longer than women's studies majors and art-therapy students, but Cuellen got mashed to a pulp pretty quickly. It usually takes ethnic-studies majors another year to realize that they're wasting their precious youth on a Sisyphean endeavor. Continued Anderson: "Of course, we don't worry about it too much. Every year, there's a fresh crop to throw in the grinder. As we speak, scores of apple-cheeked students are hearing about TFA for the first time. According to Anderson, a small portion of these students will lose interest after hearing horror stories from program alumni. "But the majority of them will march on like cattle to the slaughter, thinking that pure determination and hope can change young lives," Anderson said. "I can hear their footsteps now, marching toward our offices like lemmings to a cliff. And believe me, we're ready for 'em." Cuellen said he applied to TFA in search of a "character-building experience. "I knew that teaching in a severely under-funded inner-city school would be challenging, but I wanted to get out into the real world," Cuellen said. "Well, breaking up fistfights between 8-year-olds all day long, I got a real ugly view of reality. Do you want to know reality? Look at a dog lying dead in the gutter. That's reality. Although Cuellen quit the program early, his mother said he was with TFA long enough for it "to crack open his bones and suck out the marrow inside. "Andy is a ghost," Beverly Cuellen said. "Those [TFA] people beat the idealism out of him, then they stomped on him while he lay there gasping for air. TFA regional coordinator Sandra Richman said it is common to blame the TFA employees for the organization's high plow-through rate. "Should I have said something to wake those kids up sooner? " Richman said, crushing out her seventh cigarette. "Probably. But listen, no one can tell you that you can't make a difference. It's something you have to figure out for yourself. "You can only do so much," Richman added. "After a couple years of trying to teach our applicants about how difficult and depressing their lives will inevitably be — no matter what they choose to do for money — I just got burnt out. In the end, you've gotta resign yourself to failure and move on with your life.

U.S. Inspires World With Attempt At Democratic Election
NEW YORK — Observers from around the world report that they were inspired and moved by America's most recent attempt to hold a public election in accordance with the standards of a democratic republic. "After all of the recriminations, infighting, and general madness before the election, the people of this fractured nation still found the courage to show up at the polls," said Anas Salman, an Afghan U.N. official who was in New York during the American electoral experiment. "More than half of America's citizens — a large portion of them women — made a valiant attempt to choose their own leader, even though there was no guarantee their votes would be counted. It was truly inspirational. In the weeks leading up to the election, both of America's political parties alleged fraud in voter registration. Additionally, experts debated the reliability of electronic voting machines, which experienced problems in trial runs and leave no paper trail. Election officials also bemoaned many states' use of outdated punchcard machines. Considering such disputes, Salman said he was "touched and gladdened" that voter turnout for the U.S. election nearly approached voter-turnout rates for Afghanistan's first popular elections in October, when 69 percent of citizens cast ballots. "True, voter turnout in many parts of the world tops 90 percent," Salman said. "But it's understandable that the rate is lower in countries such as Afghanistan, where the government has raised fears of possible terrorist attacks at the polls. Our people showed great courage. The last American presidential election, held in 2000, was also rife with problems. Myriad scandals arose concerning alleged fraud and ballot tampering. Although the Democratic candidate won the popular vote by a margin of half a million votes, the Republican candidate won the presidency with a strenuously disputed 537-vote lead in Florida, a state governed by his brother. "Despite the specter of corruption in 2000, and even though the procedural problems which surfaced during the previous election were never remedied, the American people chose to put their faith in the system once again this year," said Joseph Mtume, a Kenyan diplomat who traveled to Ohio to view America's democratic proceedings. "You can't help but feel touched by the determination of these citizens who put their doubts aside to collectively participate in the democratic process. All this in a nation divided by war, where dissent is widespread and the rift between citizens has rarely been higher. It was truly stirring. Carlos Cruz, an Argentinian diplomat who observed the election in Miami, said he was profoundly moved by America's democratic election. "With my own eyes, I saw people from all walks of life waiting in long lines to cast their votes, and very few of them were turned away," Cruz said. "They believed in the democratic process, despite the existence of racial gerrymandering of the sort most recently seen in the redistricting of U.S. House seats to negate the impact of Hispanic and black voters in Texas." Cruz said he was impressed that average citizens still participate in the "current money-dominated electoral process," even though legislators have largely ignored their repeated calls for campaign finance reform. "Their wide-eyed earnestness was humbling," Cruz said. "Truly, my heart leaps up. I can only hope that, under such demoralizing circumstances, my countrymen would similarly rise together to try and make democracy work. The multinational watchdog group Organization for Security and Cooperation sent 600 official observers to monitor proceedings, from countries as disparate as North Korea, Syria, and China. Many reported that they came away deeply touched. "To see a country with such overwhelming problems — problems that affect every last citizen — have so many of its voters feel that they can still influence their leadership… words fail me," said Dae Jung Kim, a North Korean OSC delegate. "Certainly, my report to my own government will emphasize this. I will recommend that my leaders implement such American election-time strategies and tactics as would fit the North Korean model of personal freedom, such as their elegant Electoral College and the inscrutable voting machine.

Tim Duncan Begins Summer Job At Apple Genius Bar
SAN ANTONIO — Spurs center Tim Duncan returned to his summer job at the Apple Store Genius Bar Monday, where he provided technical support during his eight-hour shift by diagnosing problems, troubleshooting software issues, and repairing people's computers, iPhones, and iPods. "I can't stress to our customers enough that they really need to make multiple backups of their data," said Duncan, who has worked at the San Pedro Avenue location for the past three summers. "A lot of times we can retrieve files from a crashed hard drive, but you shouldn't rely on that. Also, you can increase the battery life of your laptop if you shut it down when you're transporting it from one place to another. " Duncan has also offered to take a shift for fellow Apple Genius David Atwood on Saturday, saying it would be a shame for his coworker to miss Game 3 of the Nuggets-Mavericks Western Conference Semifinals.

Tim Duncan Offers To Do Taxes For Entire Spurs Team
SAN ANTONIO — As the playoffs grow nearer, Spurs center Tim Duncan has taken it on himself to ensure his team is focused, relaxed, and utterly prepared for tax day by offering to complete their state and federal forms himself. "C'mon, guys, just a couple days left in the regular season, and you know what that means — get your W-2s to me as soon as you can, plus records of any memorabilia sales or shoe endorsements you've done, and just as important, tell me about any deductible expenses you've incurred," Duncan told him teammates during a time-out with 3:40 left to play in the Spurs' 72-65 win over the Trailblazers Sunday. "Tony, I bet you put all your receipts in a shoebox again, didn't you? Manu, tell me if you've been sending more than 37 percent of your income overseas, because that's a whole different set of declaration forms I have to print out. Okay, got it? Break!" Duncan later disclosed to reporters that he paid over $865,000 in late-filing fees for the 2007 Spurs.

Tim Duncan Calls Out Geometric Angle Needed To Make Bank Shot
SAN ANTONIO — Immediately after releasing a 12-foot jump shot Tuesday night, Spurs center Tim Duncan called out the angle necessary for the ball to bank off the backboard and into the basket. "Forty-six-point-seven degrees," said the airborne Duncan, also noting the ball's initial upward velocity of 14.4 meters per second after a moment of mental calculation. "Two points. " According to team sources, when teammate Tony Parker failed to call out the angle of a bank shot later in the game, Duncan glared at the point guard for the entire fourth quarter.

Texas Constructs U.S. Border Wall To Keep Out Unwanted Americans
WICHITA FALLS, TX — Calling it an essential step toward securing the Texas border and protecting his people's way of life, Gov. Rick Perry announced Tuesday the completion of a 1,953-mile wall designed to keep out millions of unwanted Americans. According to Perry, the 75-foot-high barricade running along the northern boundary is the culmination of more than 160 years of escalating tensions between Texas and the United States. Though a protective barrier has been under consideration for decades, the Texas Legislature voted unanimously to begin construction on the project immediately following the 2008 presidential election. "As governor, it is my responsibility to do whatever's necessary to maintain the territorial integrity of Texas," Perry told reporters during a press conference held inside a sniper tower overlooking Oklahoma. "If you are a Texas citizen, you shouldn't have to worry about some American coming in here, using your goods and services, and taking away your job. "Let the record show I have nothing personal against Americans," Perry added. "I just think they should stay in America, where they belong. The wall is comprised of six security layers: a razor-wire fence equipped with motion sensors, surveillance cameras, and guard towers; a 70-foot-wide trench with expert marksmen stationed along its perimeter; a roadway patrolled by armed vehicles equipped with synchronized electromagnetic wave gradiometers to detect Americans attempting to tunnel their way into Texas; and a second, third, and fourth fence. The final section of the barricade, a reinforced concrete enclosure containing the city of Austin, will be finished by August 2009. "These Americans are destroying the moral and social fabric of our state," said Rep. Chris Turner, who added that he worries when he looks around Texas and sees people from places like Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Vermont. "The man who used to repair my truck was replaced by some mechanic who moved in here from Kansas. Lately I can't go to the store or the bank without running into all kinds of these foreigners. This wall is the only hope we have of keeping Texas safe. "The truth is, Americans are just different from us," Turner added. "We don't even speak the same language. According to Texas Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Tom Alford, Americans will only be permitted to cross the border if they have immediate family living in Texas, in which case they can apply for a 90-minute monitored visitation to be held inside a checkpoint detention facility. However, Alford stressed that any American attempting to transport barbecue sauce, beef jerky, belt buckles, or longhorn cattle back to the United States will face the death penalty. Thus far, a majority of Texas citizens support the border wall, with nearly 8 million signing up to join a coalition of Minutemen that will guard the fence. "These good-for-nothing Americans want to come in here and wait in the same lines as me, watch the same movies, and eat at the same restaurants," El Paso resident and border patrol volunteer Larry Carlile told reporters. "Who do they think they are? I'd never dare waltz into America and act like I owned the place. That country's a godforsaken hellhole, anyway. "Round 'em up and get 'em out," Carlile added. "Go back to Seattle or whatever you call it. Since the wall's completion, there has been no official comment from Washington. However, sources close to President Obama said that upon being informed of Gov. Perry's announcement the commander in chief muttered, "Thank God."

What This Town Needs Is A Child In A Well
It seems like every house in this town has a fence, every door a lock. Our next-door neighbors have become strangers. We've lost touch with our friends. Our community's streets are safer than ever, but its residents have become isolated. We desperately need something to strengthen the common bonds that have weakened over time. If you ask me, what this town needs is a child in a well. Yes, a child trapped 50 feet underground would do wonders for Greenwood. It could be a private well, but for logistical reasons, it'd be better if it were a public one. In a perfect world, the child would fall into the well smack-dab in the center of the town square. If that happened, I'll bet you anything we could shrug off decades of simmering resentment, distrust, and alienation way before the little shaver was back in his bed. The feeble, intermittent moans of that poor child trapped beneath the earth would do wonders for folks up above. Townsfolk would exchange silent, concerned looks in the grocery store. Citizens would invite mail carriers into their living rooms for tea. No one would eat alone at Nora's Diner anymore — all because of one innocent child lodged inside a deep abandoned well. It should definitely be a dry well. The boy will have to suffer, of course, but if he were to drown on Day One, the whole rescue-bonding thing would be shot to hell. Can you imagine? People will say "I just hope he's okay. " They won't even have to say whom. Our minds will be so in sync, they'll automatically conjure up images of a helpless, whimpering little boy trapped in the darkness below, day after day. Hopefully, at least eight days. Maybe as many as 10 if we lower him some sandwiches. As the days stretch on, his pain will be our pain — Greenwood's. I do want it to be a boy in our well. A girl just wouldn't do. Sure, it would be tragic to know that a dishwater-blonde angel was trapped down inside the cold ground, but I can feel it in my bones: A boy is what Greenwood needs to get out of this slump. That little Timmy Evans would do splendidly. It's important to pick the right boy. Timmy is young enough to be cute, but old enough to comprehend danger. And with that flaxen hair and those skinny little arms, he inspires sympathy even before any tragedy has befallen him. Another option would be young Danny Williams. Of course, at 9, Danny is no spring chicken, as far as well-trapped kids go. Still, I believe he could do in a pinch. We definitely don't want that good-for-nothing Max Bartleby. Everyone would just sit at home secretly thinking, "I hope the brat dies. " That would be even worse than if nobody fell down the well. Whoever the boy ultimately is, he should handle the situation with class. His bravery should impress us. He shouldn't whine or cry wantonly. He should make the adults of the town wonder whether they would be so fearless in similar circumstances. The child who gets lodged in our town well should be heroic. We'd keep the tragedy to ourselves for a couple days, but after the second or third day, the story could go national. Just imagine the headlines! USA Today: "Small Town Rallies Around Third-Grader Stuck In Well." Chicago Sun-Times: "Greenwood Danny Soldiers On." The copy writes itself. If we could drop a camera down there to snap a photo, it might even go global. It definitely would if the photo managed to capture the terror in the child's eyes. Do you think they could get a microphone down there? Imagine his thin little voice: "I'll be okay, Mommy. Don't worry. " Then you'd cut to a shot of his mother. She'd be on the verge of hysterics even before the boy got to say, "I can't feel my legs no more. " Now is not the time to discuss merchandising opportunities, but these well stories make great movies. But, like I said, now is not the time. Above all, this is about reviving our cherished sense of community. Of course, the child would have to survive. It's good to end these sorts of heart-wrenching, dramatic events with a message of hope and inspiration. The people of Greenwood do not need a corpse. That's just depressing. A whole town comes together, puts aside its differences, invites the mailman in for tea, and then the boy dies? Nope, the boy must live. That said, we don't want him totally out of danger. No. Greenwood needs to hear the experts talking about gangrene and hypothermia. We need to start imagining the little tyke in tattered rags, deep circles under his eyes, limbs blue. Greenwood needs a crisis with a dirty, tear-stained face. And I truly believe that, if we apply our strong Greenwood work ethic and a little bit of ingenuity, we can make it happen. Janet Casey

Sports Unable To Heal Small Town Following Tragedy
MILL RUN, PA — In a town where residents are still in shock over last Sunday's brutal mass slaying, in which a mentally disturbed man shot 17 men, women, and children in Main Street's St. John The Baptist Church before turning his shotgun on himself, last night's County League baseball game against longtime rival Uniontown was completely ineffective in mending the hurt and despair felt by those in the area. According to those in attendance, even after the supposed natural healing powers of pitches, hits, stolen bases, ground balls, and bunts, the shooting — the first in Mill Run in over 10 years and easily the most deadly criminal incident in Mill Run's history — remained fresh and raw in the town's collective consciousness. Mill Run lost the game 7-4, though many at the game say they were still in shock over the shooting and were therefore not aware of the final score. "I still miss my brother and my sister-in-law," still-shaken hardware store owner John Geary said after the ultimately non-therapeutic sporting event. "God, I miss them so much. Even that double by Josh [Thurman] in the fifth [inning] really didn't make me feel any better about some madman shooting them. In fact, I felt worse, because for the brief second I cheered, I almost forgot that I'll never see Randy and Melissa again, that Father Corrigan isn't supposed to ever regain consciousness, and that some of the children in this community are now parentless. "Cheering for a stupid double in a stupid baseball game after everything that happened," Geary added. "What kind of idiot am I? Why did they even play this game? Mill Run mayor Frank Shultz said the game was not canceled due to his mistaken belief in the "healing power of sports" to "make everything better. "Obviously, I couldn't have been more wrong," Shultz, who doesn't plan on attending another sporting event for a long time, told reporters after the game. "And I officially apologize to all the citizens, who need professional help, spiritual guidance, and each other's love and company far more than they needed a stupid baseball game. "Everyone wants everything to go back to the way it was, but seeing as how a man killed 17 people in our church and then shot himself, I think I would much rather admit that things are completely abnormal at the moment than pretend that I care if we make the playoffs," said resident Diane Ward, 47, who said her shock and grief were in no way blunted by a crisply executed double play in the seventh inning. Locals reportedly watched in shocked silence throughout the entire game, rarely reacting to the play on the field, and never with much enthusiasm. No one interviewed afterwards believed that the sight of the team taking the field was symbolic of the town's will to "continue on," took any solace whatsoever in the collective singing of the national anthem, or thought the moment of silence before the game's first pitch was "moving," considering that it occurred at the trivial and relatively unimportant site of Town Baseball Field #5 and not a more dignified location. In fact, attendees said, at no point did anyone suffering from the pain and despair created by the massive murder-suicide, a tragedy that will forever alter this town's way of life, feel any less miserable because of the nine-inning baseball game. "It's just baseball," said Tracey Wallace, 11, who lost both parents and her older brother in the slaying and reportedly had to be sedated to stop her convulsive sobbing after she was asked if she would like to throw out a "healing" first pitch. "Not Daddy alive again. Not Mommy back. Just baseball. The baseball game's inability to heal the town came as a shock to many in the sports and sports-entertainment media. According to every single ESPN correspondent, Sports Illustrated editor, and every nationally known sports columnist, over the last six years the spectacle of sports has invariably allowed individuals, communities, and entire nations to almost instantly heal, and in some cases, apparently skip altogether the normal years-long grieving process that accompanies a monumental tragedy. "I don't know what's wrong with these people," Daily News columnist Mike Lupica said on Sunday's edition of ESPN's The Sports Reporters. "Maybe they just didn't understand what was supposed to happen. First, the group experience of watching the game was supposed to show the town how strong they were/are as a community. Second, with that newfound strength, it was their role to realize they could overcome any type of tragedy as long as they have one another. Third, while the game was going on, if they observed anything positive from the home team — a clutch hit, a home run, or a well-fielded ground ball — it was the duty of those in attendance to have the epiphany that their deceased loved ones were watching from above, cheering them on from heaven, and that everyone on Earth could and should now move on. "And most of all, those in attendance would leave the game completely healed so that everyone could see how beautiful it was that, with the aid of the eternal magic of baseball, this town was capable of healing," Lupica added. "Mill Run screwed that one up. I think these people are letting this whole church murder thing get in the way of what's really important. Mill Run resident Tommy Shroyer, who was in the church at the time of the shooting, disagreed with Lupica, saying, "Believe me, I didn't feel that anybody was watching us from above. I felt really sad, like I was doing something stupid, because if they were watching they were probably wondering what the fuck we were doing at a baseball game. According to Denver Post sports columnist Woody Paige, the area doesn't need time to reflect upon the tragedy. "These sad sacks simply need more sports," Paige wrote in a piece that received over 500 positive e-mails from fans nationwide in less then two hours. "I recommend the town's mayor get his town healed by adding 20 more County League baseball games, moving up the start date of the high-school football season, and bringing players from the Pittsburgh Steelers into the school gymnasium to play a fun and heartwarming game of mandatory celebrity donkey basketball. Sports is going to heal these people whether they want it to or not.

I Remember When This Town Used To Turn Out For A River Dredging
Back not too long ago, there was a real sense of community in this town. Folks couldn't wait to see one another at the weekly ice-cream social or Little League game. Why, I even recall a time when we wouldn't pass two weeks together without every soul in town coming together on a sunny, cloudless Sunday afternoon — an afternoon just like today — and lining the banks of that old river for no reason other than to watch police divers pull a purple, bloated, flaxen-haired lad of 10 from its murky depths. But I suppose those times is over. Hell, nowadays you'd be lucky to see the missing boy's family stick around for more than an hour or two. Too busy with their cable TV and their video games and whatnot for simple joys like watching the authorities trawl up and down the river in desperate search of yet another slain innocent. No, the modern world just doesn't seem to have time to just take a moment, sit back, and really appreciate the austere beauty of a young child's partially decomposed and waterlogged torso hooked to a chain, breaking the still, glassy surface of a lazy river. And that's a shame. If I remember correctly, the last time we had any real excitement 'round here was when they dredged up them Davis twins. But even then there weren't more than a handful of onlookers and most headed home right after they dragged young Tyler out. I think it was Phil Graney — nice fella, runs the Hardware store on High street — who turned to me and said, "Why wait around? It's just going to be the same exact thing when they pull out Peyton." To me, that says it all: everybody rushing around and forgetting the traditions that make our great town what it is. Traditions like the annual rhubarb pie–eating contest, the Easter Father-Daughter Pancake Breakfast, or gathering around the ol' river banks with your neighbors to watch the cops discover a contorted, hacked-up youngster with the fear of his final moments still plainly visible in his rheumy, dead eyes. Traditions that just a few years ago would have been given their due reverence. Of course, back when I was knee-high to a grasshopper, a river dredging used to be an all-day event. Everyone from the mayor to the dead child's school chums would mill about for hours and hours, talking in hushed, expectant tones until finally, a barely recognizable, broken, and battered little body would be hauled ashore. But with all the new sonar doodads and computer technology and what have you, it's the exception if they don't find the blonde tyke inside 30 minutes. And who's going to get excited about that? No, the times have certainly changed. And what with spectators nowadays as rare as a hen's teeth, it's the quality of the murders that's really suffered. Hell, you'd hardly believe me if I told you some of the things I've seen them drag up in my day. Like the time they found the Heller boy, and damned if he didn't have his own severed ears stuffed in his mouth! But the people dropping carcasses in the river these days are downright lazy, if you ask me. Can't be bothered to do more than your basic strangle, strip, and dump. Don't even have the decency to cover up their tracks by sandpapering fingerprints, severing heads, and pulling teeth. They'd rather check their e-mail than take a few minutes to carve a cryptic string of hieroglyphics into the boy's forehead. Guess folks just don't take pride in their work anymore. Not that the townspeople are completely to blame. They're a generally decent lot, and there are some things that contribute to this mess that nobody can do anything about. The weather, for one, isn't exactly helping. Last couple of years have bordered on drought, and who's going to hunker down for a dredging when there's already a tiny, golden-bronze foot just sticking out of the water, plain as day, because the levels are so low? Hell, maybe not even me. Oh well. I suppose my way of thinking is as moldy as the clothes on that Larson boy who washed up last summer. No, there isn't a person left in this town who'd pay a wooden nickel to see the once-sunken corpse of a baby-eyed child bobbing above the soft river currents. I guess that's just something I'm going to have to get used to. Jonah Whalen

Area Man Makes It Through Day
SCHAUMBURG, IL — Despite an overwhelming, seemingly endless barrage of frustrations, area systems analyst Adam Blume made it through the entire day Tuesday, overcoming the odds against him in a Herculean display of courage, perseverance, and the indomitable human spirit. According to witnesses, though it seemed on more than one occasion throughout the day that his life would come to an end, Blume valiantly found the wherewithal to carry on. Not only did the 37-year-old successfully get out of bed and leave his apartment, but he somehow found the strength to navigate through the day's many challenges and, once victorious, made his way back home again. Hit from every side with such formidable opponents as suburban conformity, mind-numbing coworkers, and the celebrity "infotainment" magazine he paged through on his lunch break, Blume nonetheless trudged along — permitting nothing, no matter how soul-deadening, to break his will. "Man, what a day," Blume said regarding his 16-hour battle with everything from public transportation to profound spiritual alienation. Experts estimate that, by 10 p.m. Tuesday night, Blume had survived exposure to approximately 1,700 advertising images of epic banality, at least 35 emotionless interactions with complete strangers without making any real human contact, and more than 25,000 moments of soul-crushing inner emptiness throughout the almost day-long struggle. In addition, he also surmounted the onslaught of more than 150 separate anxiety-producing forces, including credit card debt, weight gain, hair loss, sexual inferiority, loneliness, a dead-end job, geographical isolation from extended family, virus-laden spam, the need to keep his cell phone charged, in-store Muzak, mortality, mounting laundry and dishes, his cable bill, indefinable longing, fear of terrorism, online gossip, the unavoidable certainty of his own unimportance, nostalgia for a past that never was, severe lower-back pain, and general ennui. "I only wish I had gotten a chance to pick up those replacement filters for the vacuum cleaner," Blume said only moments after valiantly suppressing the urge to set fire to his carefully cataloged file cabinet of insurance information and old appliance manuals. "The last ones I got were for the wrong model, but I can't take them back because I didn't save the receipt and now I need new ones. "And for some reason, I had the song 'Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe' stuck in my head all day," he added. Blume's epic odyssey of survival reportedly began at 6:15 a.m., the moment he awoke. After enduring the sudden, unrelenting attack of his bedside alarm clock, Blume resisted the near-overpowering compulsion to press the snooze button a second time. Courageously hurling himself from bed and dragging his almost unconscious body the 15 feet to his bathroom, Blume was almost defeated before even making it to work when, as he was putting toothpaste on his toothbrush, it fell on the floor. "I thought I was going to lose it right there," Blume later told reporters. "It was lying in that space between the sink and the bathtub, covered in dust, so I had to bend over, grab it, rinse it off under some hot water, and put some more toothpaste on it. I hate when that happens. According to roommate Joe Tesch, with whom Blume shares an apartment despite already having reached middle age, the physically, financially, and spiritually exhausted man then stared at his hollow face in the mirror for approximately three minutes before showering, shaving, and moving his bowels in time to catch the 7:04 bus. After arriving at work, Blume's trials and tribulations only continued. Over the next 10 hours, Blume weathered an onslaught against his very humanity, from automated menus on telephones and cash machines, to shrill homeless men yelling in the street, to a coffee stain on his workplace-mandated tie. This was not Blume's first exposure to adversity. When pressed, he was able to recall several such incidents, including the time in May 1993 when he walked on crutches all the way from the bus stop at the bottom of a large hill in Madison, WI to the unemployment office located at the top, the 72 hours he spent stranded in Chicago's O'Hare Airport during the 2004 Christmas season, and the thousands of other battles before, between, and since. "Another day, another dollar," said Blume, modestly downplaying the impressive scope of his accomplishments. "I suppose I just did what anybody would have done. Blume's inspiring battle against the dehumanizing forces of modernity continues tomorrow.

Drinking In Quarries Down 37 Percent, Small-Town Sheriffs Report
WOODWARD, OK — U.S. teens are "getting wasted" down at the local quarry 37 percent less than in years past, according to the small-town sheriffs who closely monitor their activities. "In the past three months, we've only received two citizen complaints about rowdy kids down at the old Carter quarry, and we've all but suspended patrol duty out there," said Woodward County Sheriff Clyde "Dutch" Meinhold at a press conference Monday. "Last year at this time, we twice picked up the Meyer twins and that Craig Rothamer character who lives over in Mooreland. This year, I haven't seen hide nor hair of them down there. Not so much as a single blackberry-brandy empty. Long used as a secluded spot for illicit teenage drinking, the nation's quarries are slowly returning to their original function of mineral excavation. Reasons for the decrease in quarry drinking include incarceration of drinkers, induction into military service, and it being colder than a son-of-a-bitch lately. "Well, I suppose with Brad Hightower in the Army now, and Jason Klaus marrying his pregnant ex-girlfriend and working his ass off at the grain elevator, these kids' party days are winding down," said Sheriff John Pressman of Waushara County, WI. "Last week, one of my deputies did catch Bobby Hightower and Lee Olle over at the quarry with what looked like a Zima, but it turns out it was just a Pepsi Blue. Surprised the heck out of me, because the Hightowers are one hard-drinking clan. They don't mean nothing by it; they're good people. Why, I used to go with Brad Sr.'s sister Bev back in high school. Sheriffs attribute the decrease to numerous other factors, including Fanning Spring, FL, teen Jerry Kopecky breaking his leg at the go-cart track; Matt Biederhof of Okaton, SD, being so whipped by his new girlfriend that he scarcely hangs with his buds anymore; and Robert Carey of Buckman, MN, violating probation after trying to dislodge several Homies figurines from a candy machine with a Dairy Queen spoon. Rural liquor stores are feeling the pinch, reporting lower sales than usual for such quarry staples as peppermint schnapps, malt liquor, and fortified wine. "Betty over at Friendly Liquor says the only suspicious thing she noticed all holiday season was the Feinske boy trying to buy Tom & Jerry mix," said Sheriff Hobart Baum of Clarion County, PA. "Probably thought there was alcohol in it. Well, what can you say, he's only 11." The decline in quarry drinking has also been cause for concern at Jack Daniel's, which recently unveiled "Hard Cola," a product whose customer base is roughly 70 percent quarry drinkers. Attempting to adjust, Jack Daniel's is retooling the product's marketing campaign to target college binge drinkers, parking-lot tipplers, and overweight secretaries on "Just Us Girls" after-work outings. "Traditionally, sales of quarry beverages like Hard Cola ebb during the winter months, but we're seeing the same decline in more temperate climates, too," Jack Daniel's spokeswoman Lynda Pfeiffer said. "We're optimistic about the future of Hard Cola, but we're also mindful of the toll taken on the wine-cooler industry back in the early 1990s, when a similar quarry-drinking drop-off occurred. Bartles & Jaymes never had a chance. Despite the pervasiveness of the decline, some sheriffs are confident that the trend will begin to reverse itself when the weather warms. "Just yesterday, I caught that Dubrow kid and his buddy Glenn with an unopened Mickey's Big Mouth," said Sheriff Gordon Leahy of Perry County, IL. "They claimed they found it on the ground while looking for arrowheads. Bullcrap."

Cheney Waits Until Last Minute Again To Buy Sept. 11 Gifts
WASHINGTON — Busy dealing with important paperwork and other vice presidential duties in recent weeks, Dick Cheney was forced to put off until the last minute a cherished annual tradition: gift-shopping for his favorite holiday, 9/11. "I looked at the calendar yesterday, and I couldn't believe my eyes — 9/11 is almost here!" a rosy-cheeked Cheney said upon returning to the White House Sunday with two giant bags overflowing with gift-wrapped boxes and big red bows. "It's the most wonderful time of the year." While Cheney is known by many to be cold and taciturn for the other 11 months of the year, those close to the vice president say there is something about the 9/11 season that puts a smile on his face and a spring in his step. Each Sept. 11 morning since 2001, Cheney has come to work donning a fireman costume and handed out small, thoughtful gifts to all White House staffers. In addition, at his home on 9/11 Eve, Cheney lays out large piles of presents for his children and grandchildren underneath the colorfully lit, six-foot-tall 9/11 towers that he sets up by the fireplace. "I think I've outdone myself this year — I bought the president a box of cigars and a brand-new fountain pen, I got Condoleezza [Rice] a beautiful blue blazer, and for my wife [Lynne] I bought a diamond necklace, a new winter coat, and this neat little motorized airplane ornament to hang on the 9/11 towers," Cheney told reporters while perusing the windows of New York's famed Park Avenue shops. "And for [grandson] Samuel I bought about a million toys and games and 9/11 nutcrackers. I probably went a little bit overboard, but it's his first 9/11, and I want it to be as special as my first 9/11." The vice president then reiterated how fortunate he was to have received his big 9/11 bonus early this year. Although Cheney himself has never received any Sept. 11 gifts, with the exception of a pair of silk pajamas from his wife and a second term in office, he insisted that he gets more joy from giving than receiving. According to Cheney, Sept. 11 is a time to reflect and give thanks for all the benefits and blessings 9/11 has given him in the past. Cheney, however, lamented the fact that he has seen a recent decline in the nation's 9/11 spirit. "I don't know what's happened," Cheney said. "Less than seven years ago, 9/11 seemed like a huge event for every American. Back then, on Sept. 11 morning, everyone would dart downstairs at 8:46 a.m. sharp, shouting and screaming, and the ground outside would be blanketed in the most beautiful gray as far as the eye could see. I especially loved the streets of New York during this season — the lights, the sounds, people rushing every which way, the sidewalks so crowded you could barely move, the wide-eyed looks on the people's faces. The whole New York skyline was lit up like a Christmas tree." Cheney then sighed happily, adding, "I wish every day were 9/11." While he's disappointed that so many seem to have forgotten the lessons of his beloved holiday, the vice president said he simply could not stay sad with 9/11 just around the corner. Lynne Cheney told reporters she expects her husband will once again go overboard in his celebrations this year, buying a larger 9/11 front-yard display and making himself sick eating too many broken Pentagon cookies. "He really gets into it," she said as her husband cheerfully decorated the Blue Room of the White House with pieces of smoldering cinder and charred flesh to recreate the setting of Ground Zero. "I try to tell him that it's just a silly holiday, that he's making a fool out of himself when he goes around shouting 'Happy Sept. 11!' to people while ringing a large bell, but he never listens. He just loves 9/11." But amid all the decorating and gift-giving, Vice President Cheney is careful not to let all the 9/11 festivities distract him from the deeper significance the day holds. "Sometimes, in all the hustle and bustle of the season, it's easy to forget the true meaning of Sept. 11," Cheney said. "Sept. 11 is not about fancy 9/11 parades, or big 9/11 office parties. In fact, it's not even just about two buildings crumbling to the ground and leaving thousands of innocent people dead." "No," Cheney continued. "No, 9/11 is about the warm feeling you get when you help an elderly woman cross the street and then whisper to her that the terrorists can strike at any moment. 9/11 is about the satisfaction of telling people to do things and then them doing it — not because they want to, but because they are afraid to do otherwise. 9/11 is about removing Saddam Hussein from power. But most of all, 9/11 is about love." Cheney said he plans to spend a quiet Sept. 11 at home this year, during which he will exchange gifts with loved ones and watch his taped VHS footage of the old 9/11 TV specials while he smiles and laughs. "I have a feeling this is going to be the best Sept. 11 ever," Cheney said with a grin. "I just dread the day I have to tell my kids that 9/11 isn't real."

Giuliani To Run For President Of 9/11
NEW YORK — At a well-attended rally in front of his new Ground Zero headquarters Monday, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani officially announced his plan to run for president of 9/11. "My fellow citizens of 9/11, today I will make you a promise," said Giuliani during his 18-minute announcement speech in front of a charred and torn American flag. "As president of 9/11, I will usher in a bold new 9/11 for all. If elected, Giuliani would inherit the duties of current 9/11 President George W. Bush, including making grim facial expressions, seeing the world's conflicts in terms of good and evil, and carrying a bullhorn at all state functions. "Let us all remember how we felt on that day, with the world watching our every move, waiting on our every word," said Giuliani, flanked by several firefighters, ex-New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and Judith Nathan, his third wife. "With a campaign built on traditional 9/11 values, and with the help of every citizen who believes in the 9/11 dream, I want to make 9/11 great again. According to Washington–based political analyst Gregory Hammond, Giuliani's candidacy "should not be underestimated. "Sure, he has no foreign or national policy experience, and both his personal life and political career are riddled with scandal," said Hammond. "But in the key area of having been on TV on 9/11, the other candidates simply cannot match him. And as we saw in 2004, that's what matters most to voters in this post-9/11 world. After his downtown Manhattan announcement, Giuliani held an afternoon rally near the Pentagon. In the early evening, he flew to a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where he hosted a $5,000-a-plate fundraising dinner in a tent decorated with clouds of ash, streaming sheets of singed office paper, and small piles of authentic rubble from the World Trade Center site. Among the policy planks listed on his website are his Cleaner Air Act, which would severely limit the levels of smoke and harmful gases allowed to pour from 747s flying into 110-story office buildings, guaranteed health insurance covering burns caused by shards of burning metal, and his "No Child Left Behind In A Smoldering Skyscraper" initiative. Giuliani supporters praised the candidate for his "early and unwavering commitment" to 9/11. "People talk about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, but did either of them happen to be mayor of New York in September 2001?" Bedford, NH resident Helen Rolfe said. "Guiliani was. To me, that speaks volumes about this man. Though his campaign apparatus is not yet fully operational, Giuliani's "mobile campaign units" — refurbished fire trucks decorated with banners, balloons, and bloodstains, whose droning sirens continuously blare Giuliani's official campaign song — have already begun canvassing towns in Iowa and New Hampshire. Giuliani's pro-9/11 message seems to be resonating with potential voters. Said Ames, IA voter Alan Benoit: "I remember seeing Rudolph Giuliani's face, on television, saying reassuring things during a highly emotional moment filled with fear and confusion. He's got my vote. With more than a year until the primaries — unless Giuliani's court-filed request to hold New York's primary on the second Tuesday in September is approved — Giuliani said it is too early to discuss potential running mates, though he refused to rule out the possibility of naming a twisted, half-melted aluminum beam, an FDNY ball cap, or even John McCain. Giuliani, however, called rumors that he had met with a large shard of glass from the wreckage of the Pentagon "patently untrue. "Letting 9/11 fall into the hands of the Democrats in 2008 would be nothing short of a national tragedy," Giuliani said. "Ever since 9/11 was founded that fateful day on 9/11, 9/11 has stood for one thing: 9/11."

Clinton Injected With Highly Unstable Experimental Growth Serum
WASHINGTON, DC — Forced to take desperate measures in a last-minute attempt to avert disaster and save the free world, President Clinton ordered top military scientists to inject his body with a highly unstable experimental growth serum Monday. "Earth is threatened on every side by danger. We must act now to save humanity," Clinton said in a prepared statement prior to receiving the untested super-serum. "Our rapidly fragmenting societal infrastructure faces myriad crises: drugs in our streets, guns in our schools, economic collapse in Asia, military aggression in Europe, and global environmental destruction creating an unstoppable army of six-legged mutant frogs. If nothing is done, disaster is imminent. "This experiment, risky as it is, is a gamble I cannot afford not to take," Clinton said. "It may be our only hope. The serum, still considered "extremely dangerous" by Pentagon researchers, was originally developed as a means of creating the ultimate fighting machine of the future, but rejected when initial readings indicated that it was too unstable to test on human beings. Despite being warned of the potentially disastrous consequences, Clinton demanded to undergo the controversial procedure. "It's the only way," Clinton said. "Someone has got to take the risk. Strapped into a chair and surrounded by bleeping equipment and digital displays in a laboratory located beneath the city, at exactly midnight Clinton was injected with the serum known outside of Department Of Defense high command only by the code name "Project Proteus." The injection took place as scheduled, despite the 11th-hour protests of the serum's creator, Dr. Emilio Zardoz. "Don't do it, Mr. President! It hasn't been properly tested! " Zardoz shouted, bursting into the lab just as technicians moved toward Clinton with a syringe. "In the name of science, man — stop before it's too late! In the confusion, the military scientists hesitated, unsure of whether to proceed, but Clinton countermanded Zardoz's urgings. "Inject the drug! " Clinton said. "That is a direct order from the president of the United States!" When his command was not immediately obeyed — exhibiting what the scientists later called "heroic determination against all odds" — the president struggled free of one of the straps, grabbed the syringe from a technician, and administered the injection himself. "I tried to warn him," Zardoz later told reporters, wiping his brow with the sleeve of his lab coat. "God help me, what have I done? Has science birthed a benevolent superhuman champion to save us all — or an inhuman mutation? White House spokespersons acknowledge the great risk undertaken by Clinton, but insist that he made the decision because "he had no other choice. "We admit that the Project Proteus superserum was extremely unstable, and still required extensive research before it could be ruled safe," press secretary Stephen Drachler said Tuesday morning. "Yet, as the president himself pointed out, that could have taken months, and there simply wasn't time. Our situation grows more grim with each passing moment. Drachler continued: "The interest on the national debt continues to swell, causing Earth to spiral ever closer to the sun. Baron Milosevic, although defeated for now, may return unexpectedly in future episodes, augmented by a powerful new missile-equipped Serbi-Suit. Clinton had to act now, before his enemies in Congress, working in conjunction with the Squadron Of Evil, finally complete work on the dreaded Bureauchronic Ray." Several White House associates, including Zardoz himself, had begged to undergo the injection in Clinton's place in order to protect the office of the president from potential side effects of bioplasmorphic mutation. They report that Clinton refused, maintaining a courageous, patriotic stoicism in the face of their emotional pleas. "The people of this country elected me to do a job, and I can't turn my back on them," Clinton said. "This is my fight. I am the president, and the responsibility must come down to me and me alone. The second Clinton injected himself with the glowing, bright-green substance, chaos and confusion engulfed the lab. Clinton began to uncontrollably convulse, bolts of electricity shot out of his eyes, and his head jerked backwards, every muscle in his body straining. "Power! Power beyond all imagining! " Clinton shouted. "The tortures of the damned! The swirling abyss of the void! I gaze into the very eye of God!" All the computers in the room then simultaneously exploded, showering the president in sparks as he collapsed, unconscious. Many political analysts have come forward to denounce Clinton's move as a "rash action. "This scenario leaves many unanswered questions," said Harvard political-science professor F. Jacob Hinden. "Will the president mutate and become an evil 'Anti-Clinton'? Will his controversial environmental-clean-up and tax-reform initiatives continue to be blocked in the Senate? And meanwhile, back at H.Q., will Buddy's malfunctioning Negato-Collar render him permanently invisible? Clinton is currently under 24-hour supervision, with doctors waiting to see if the serum will infuse him with superpowers or kill him. If all goes well, doctors say, the president is expected to develop supergenius brain capacity, enhanced reflexes and agility, and the power of flight. In the event the serum drives Clinton mad and he escapes to wreak havoc on innocents, the National Guard unit mobilized on the White House lawn has been ordered to shoot him on sight.

Republicans, Dadaists Declare War On Art
WASHINGTON, DC — Citing the "proliferation of immoral and offensive material throughout America's museums and schools," and waving placards emblazoned with agit-prop fotocollage reading, "diE KUnst ISt tOT, DadA ubEr aLLes" ("Art is dead, dada over all"), a coalition of leading Republican congressional conservatives and early 20th-century Dadaists declared war on art in a joint press conference Monday. Calling for the elimination of federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts; the banning of offensive art from museums and schools; and the destruction of the "hoax of reason" in our increasingly random, irrational and meaningless age, the Republicans and Dadaists were unified in their condemnation of the role of the artist in society today. "Homosexuals and depraved people of every stripe are receiving federal monies at taxpayer expense for the worst kind of filth imaginable," said U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC), a longtime NEA critic. Dadaist Jean Arp agreed. "Dada is, like nature, without meaning. Dada is for nature and against art," he said. Added nonsense-poet Hugo Ball, founder of Zurich's famed Cabaret Voltaire: "…'dada' ('Dada'). Adad Dada Dada Dada." Donning an elaborate, primitivist painted paper mask, he then engaged reporters in a tragico-absurd dance, contorting wildly while bellowing inanities. Helms, well known for his opposition to arts funding, was adamant in his demand for the elimination of the NEA from the national budget. "The American people will no longer stand for vulgar, nonsensical displays that masquerade as art," said Helms, who, along with U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), demanded the passage of obscenity laws granting police and government officials broader powers in the prosecution and censorship of art. In a show of solidarity with the Republican legislators, Andre Breton, who founded the surrealist movement in 1923, fired a pistol at random into the crowd, conceptually evoking the hideous irrationality of the collective unconscious and wounding Hatch. Urging reporters to "imagine a boot stamping on a face, eternally," Breton, along with Max Picabia, the most radical anti-art proponent within the Dadaist camp, then theatrically demonstrated Helms' vision. In a collaborative staged "manifestation," Picabia pencilled a series of drawings, which Breton erased as Picadia went along. "So-called modern art is, at its core, an absurd and purposeless exercise," Helms said, echoing the Dadaists' illustration of the meaninglessness of art. He then announced the Gramm-Helms Decency Act, a bill that would facilitate the legal prosecution of obscenity, as well as establish stiffer penalities for the creators and exhibitors of "morally objectionable works. Dadaist leaders were even more strident than Helms, stressing the need for the elimination of not only art, but also of dada itself. "To be a Dadaist means to be against dada," Arp said. "Dada equals anti-dada." Urging full-scale rioting, the assembled Dadaists called for their own destruction, each of them alternately running into the audience to pelt those still on stage with tomatoes. In a gesture honoring Helms and the new bill, seminal anti-artist Marcel Duchamp drew a moustache and beard on a reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Duchamp titled the resultant image "L.H.O.O.Q.," a series of initials which, when pronounced in French, forms the sentence "Helms au chaud au cul," or "Helms has hot pants. Centered in Berlin, Paris and Zurich, the Dadaist movement was launched as a reaction of revulsion to the senseless butchery of World War I. "While the guns rumbled in the distance," Arp said, "we had a dim premonition that power-mad gangsters would one day use art itself as a means of deadening men's minds. When told of Arp's comments, Helms said he was "fairly certain" that he concurred.

Report: Presidents Washington Through Bush May Have Lied About Key Matters
WASHINGTON, DC — In allegations likely to further erode Americans' faith in the office of the presidency, presidents George Washington through George W. Bush may have lied about key matters of national import during their tenures as chief executive, an independent-counsel investigation asserted Monday. The report states that the integrity of the presidency "may have been compromised by criminal misdirection, obstruction of justice, and deliberate clouding of the truth for political advantage and/or personal gain by as many as every president since the nation's inception. While conventional wisdom holds that only two U.S. presidents, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, have ever openly lied about anything, the report offers substantial evidence linking all 42 presidents to deliberate acts of deception and dishonesty. Among its assertions are that Thomas Jefferson lied about impregnating one of his slaves; Ulysses S. Grant deceived Congress regarding his role in the Whiskey Ring scandal; Ronald Reagan intentionally withheld key facts in the Iran-Contra Affair; Warren G. Harding told untruths during the Teapot Dome scandal; James K. Polk, Martin Van Buren, and Chester A. Arthur fibbed about the details of trade pacts; and Franklin Pierce was less than forthcoming regarding details of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. "Shockingly, even William Henry Harrison, a president who was in office for a month and spent most of it on his deathbed, seems to have found time to lie during the famously lengthy inaugural address that would speed his demise," independent-counsel investigator James McManus said. "And so-called 'father of our country' George Washington is not exempt, either. A story familiar to any schoolchild tells us that, as a boy, Washington confessed to chopping down a cherry tree, saying, 'I cannot tell a lie.' Evidence suggests, however, that the entire tale may have been bogus from the start. This is doubly damning to the presidency's reputation, for it is not merely a lie, but a lie about not telling lies. The report calls into question the integrity of the presidency at a particularly inopportune moment. Coming on the heels of alleged Bush Administration involvement in the Enron and WorldCom corporate scandals, as well as the "Monicagate" impeachment trial of former president Bill Clinton, the implication of every president in U.S. history will likely deepen the public's mistrust and further undermine the credibility of the nation's highest elected office. "If these allegations turn out to be true, this country faces a crisis of confidence of unfathomable proportions," an anonymous Beltway insider said. "If the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth cannot be trusted to tell the truth, then who, in the name of God in heaven, can? "We are shocked by these allegations," White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said. "The president wishes to assure the public that he has never lied, and that every one of these accusations of lying — from the 18th century all the way to the 21st — will be thoroughly investigated and, we are confident, disproved. Calling the report "just the tip of the iceberg," McManus said incidents of lying may plague the government at all levels. "Every day, new evidence surfaces suggesting that this lying trend is more far-reaching than we ever imagined," McManus said. "It may well extend all the way to the offices of Vice-President, Speaker of the House, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Treasury, White House Press Secretary, secretary to the White House Press Secretary, Senator, Representative, State Assemblyman, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, County Board Supervisor, Alderperson, Mayor, Assistant to the Mayor, City Councilperson, Assistant City Councilperson, Comptroller, Town Coroner, County Librarian, and County Clerk." On Capitol Hill, the report prompted calls for a thorough investigation of each and every allegation, from the possibility of Bush-Cheney lies regarding Haliburton during the 2000 presidential campaign all the way back to alleged lies told by the John Adams Administration regarding the Huron Indians in 1798. "The idea that presidents and other elected officials have violated the public trust by telling lies is disturbing and deeply disappointing," U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) said. "We are adopting a 'zero tolerance' position regarding the telling of untruths on the part of any politician — past, present, or future — and we will not rest until each and every lie-teller has been punished to the fullest extent of the law. Added Hatch: "You have my solemn word on that.

Alien Still Hasn't Gotten Around To Listening To Whole Voyager Golden Record
47 U. MAJORIS STAR SYSTEM — Roughly 18 months after discovering the collection of common Earth sounds contained on the golden record placed aboard the Voyager probe NASA launched in 1977, extraterrestrial Richard Ellinger, 237, admitted Friday he still hasn't gotten around to listening to the whole thing. "The wind, rain, and surf sounds are pretty cool, but I usually sort of zone out when it gets to the crickets chirping, and then I just end up turning it off," said Ellinger, adding that he will sometimes put the record on as background noise when he's cleaning his electro-biological habitat. "And to be totally honest, I almost always skip that track with the mother kissing her baby. It's like, 'Who cares?' you know? " Ellinger said he plans on taking a few things he likes off the record — such as the traditional Peruvian wedding song, the humpback whale calls, and the tractor noises — and throwing them on a mix with some Elvis Costello classics.

Virgin Saving Himself For Kinky Couple In Need Of A Third
SAGINAW, MI — Resolving to maintain his chastity until that one special couple comes along, local virgin Kyle Markley confirmed Friday he is saving himself for a kinky pair of lovers looking for a third to spice things up. "To me, sex is a sacred thing, and I don't want to give up my purity until I know I've found the right two pervy little freaks who like to go around soliciting strangers for threesomes," said Markley, adding that you only lose your virginity once, so you have to make sure it's with a couple who gets off on deflowering young men as part of their fetish play. "I know the day will come when I finally read that Craigslist post of my dreams from 'two fit fortysomethings looking for a cutie to share,' but until then, I'm perfectly fine abstaining from sex altogether. Christianity teaches that true love waits, and I plan to wait until I'm with two people who are just dying to pass me back and forth like a fuckdoll all night." At press time, sources reported that Markley was feeling nervous but spiritually rewarded while finally getting Eiffel Towered by a married couple.

Poll Finds Majority Of Americans Would Like Things To Go Right For Once
UTICA, NY — A poll released Tuesday by Zogby International found that 72 percent of Americans would prefer it if things could go right, just this one time, without something inevitably coming along and screwing everything up. "For once in my life, it would be cool if things didn't suddenly fall apart right when they started going my way," said poll respondent Esther Lau, who listed finally catching a break as one of her personal goals. "Suppose, for example, that instead of turning into a total disaster in the end, events worked themselves out in a way that was favorable, or at least okay for the most part. That's a situation I would be amenable to." The remaining 28 percent of Americans agreed that everything was just fine, and why would this even be a question someone would ask in the first place?

Study Reveals Majority Of Suicides Occur While Trying To Put Fitted Sheet On Bed
BALTIMORE — According to a study published Monday in Psychological Bulletin, more than 83 percent of suicides take place when an individual is faced with the task of putting a fitted sheet onto a mattress. "In the majority of these cases, people end their lives after trying in vain to get the short side of the sheet onto the long side of the bed, and at least one-third kill themselves after struggling with the final corner only to realize it is their own body weight preventing the sheet from stretching far enough," said Johns Hopkins University psychologist Dr. Khalil Mazarhi, adding that suicide victims are usually discovered in close proximity to fitted sheets that are either partially covering a mattress or balled up in a corner of the room. "The tragic irony of this phenomenon is that a significant number of people will actually use the sheet to hang themselves." The study concludes with a recommendation that, for personal safety, fitted sheets only be handled when a second person is present.

Dick Cheney Vice Presidential Library Opens In Pitch-Dark, Sulfurous Underground Cave

Cheney Vice Presidential Library and Museum officially opened to the public on Wednesday, housing a variety of exhibits honoring the legacy of the former vice president on display in a vast, dark, sulfurous cave thousands of feet below the surface of the earth. According to officials, the subterranean library will permanently house the archived records and artifacts of Cheney's vice presidency and will include more than 2.7 million photographs, thousands of razor-sharp stalactites, 4 million documents offering a legal basis for torture, scalding-hot green smoke wafting out of the cave walls, an original manuscript of the Patriot Act, hundreds of sick and hungry cave bears, and 15,000 audio recordings from Cheney's private meetings. "The Cheney Museum offers a firsthand look at the life and work of our nation's 46th vice president," said head curator Jonathan Luddom, a 7-foot-tall blind cavern dweller with third-degree burns on his face and limbs. "From the Hall of Obfuscation, to the Pit of Yellowcake Uranium, to the interactive waterboarding exhibit for kids, this library is a stirring tribute to who Mr. Cheney is and what he believes in." "Now I must go and search for food and moisture," continued Luddom, moments before being devoured by a swarm of ravenous bats. The museum, which officials confirmed is under constant and comprehensive video and audio surveillance at all times, from all possible angles, will feature ceaseless cackling heard in the distance, noxious fumes, and a preserved recreation of Cheney's office, including the former vice president's desk, reportedly made from the skulls and femurs of over 4,000 dead Iraqi civilians. Sources also reported that the library's Quagmire Wing contains an endless, unannounced chasmic drop into total nothingness. "The exhibit on how he created a sprawling security state is amazing — I learned so much," said visitor Emma Moser, 29, as Black Ops agents tracked her every movement. "And it was so cool reading about what a huge part he played in destabilizing the Middle East for generations to come. What a fascinating life!" "And I can't believe that's his original heart preserved in a glass case in the atrium!" Moser added. "It was neat how it was all charred and blackened." In addition to covering Cheney's long and esteemed career in government, museum officials told reporters the infernal, cavernous library will contain a number of revealing glimpses into his personal life, including pieces from his personal collection of drones and a number of original oil paintings by the former vice president depicting empty eye sockets, various torture implements, and rotten meat hanging from hooks. "And once you're done perusing the library, don't forget to grab a hot lunch of eviscerated detainee tongue in the Cheney Cafe," read a leaked CIA memo from an anonymous source. "Stop by the gift shop, too. In fact, all are required, by the provisions of the Patriot Act, to stop by the gift shop. Those who don't will be prosecuted by the federal government." At press time, the library is currently in an undisclosed location.

Grizzled Beer Can Used As Ashtray Watches Another Headstrong 12-Pack Come And Go Through Patio
SPARTA, OH — Reflecting wryly on the latest batch of rookies to head its way, a grizzled beer can being used as an ashtray reportedly watched Monday as another cocky 12-pack came and went through the patio. "These new cans breeze in, fresh and clean from the grocery store shelf, thinking they're hot shit, but I guarantee you by the end of the night, they'll all be lying facedown in a recycling bin somewhere," said the dented 12-ounce Pabst Blue Ribbon can, confirming that it had yet to encounter another can with the tenacity to hold the cigarette butts and rainwater that had allowed it to maintain its position for so long. "Witbiers, sours, IPAs — I've survived 'em all. They think they're so damn special because they're a microbrew or they have some extra-high A.B.V., but that's not how things work in the real world. Most of these new cans will never even make it past the first round of flip cup. I tell you, the things I've seen happen to beer cans on this back porch would make you shudder." At press time, the can had reportedly resigned itself to a long, lonely winter until a new group of beverage vessels arrived next spring.

Woman Spirals Into Vortex Of Self-Doubt After Trader Joe's Cashier Does Not Compliment Any Of Her Selected Items
WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA — Questioning every decision that led her to the crucial moment, shopper Lisa Kolman spiraled into a churning vortex of crippling self-doubt Tuesday after the cashier at her local Trader Joe's failed to compliment or even comment on any of the items she had purchased. "The woman at the register next to me is practically drowning in accolades from store employees, but my cashier hasn't said a thing, not even about the olive tapenade hummus or the chocolate babka, and I just don't understand what I did wrong," said the self-conscious Kolman, who described bottoming out with deep shame when the cashier scanned her entire cart of frozen appetizers, wines, and assorted baked goods without uttering a single word of praise. "She seemed civil enough, but when she rang up my garlic naan and container of fresh mozzarella cheese, she neither asked what I was cooking nor encouraged me to make a fun pizza with it. I should have known I'd messed up when she scanned the two jars of cookie butter spread without saying anything nice to me. Not even get a simple 'Yum, I love these!' or 'Ooh, have you tried these before?' Even the guy bagging my groceries seemed to disapprove." Kolman immediately decided to return all the items in her cart and start shopping all over again.

Seating Chart Revised To Put Problem Senators Up Front
WASHINGTON — After several incidents of bipartisan name-calling and disruptive filibustering, Senate president Dick Cheney announced Monday that the congressional seating chart has been revised to put problem lawmakers up front. "I was hoping it wouldn't have to come to this, but Mr. [Sen. Dick] Durbin (D-IL) and Mr. [Sen. Jim] DeMint (R-SC), among others, have shown they're not mature enough to handle sitting in the back," said Cheney, who reportedly made Durbin read a secret bill out loud in front of the entire assembly after he was caught passing it to Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA). "I'm not going to let a few bad apples ruin lawmaking for the senators who are here to work." Cheney added that, if the behavior problems persist, the whole Senate will be made to come into the Capitol Building to legislate on weekends.

Sick Boy's 'Visit To Heaven' Sounding More And More Like Wet Dream
LA CROSSE, WI — The initially heartwarming story of cancer patient Trevor Powell's visit to heaven came under scrutiny Monday after sources close to the boy revealed that, upon reflection, the account sounded more and more like a wet dream. "At first, when Trevor said that he was going into a dark tunnel and felt a warm energy begin to envelope his body, I was tempted to believe him," said oncological nurse Megan Thompson, one of many hospital employees intrigued by Trevor's claims of a tantalizing journey to the great beyond. "But when he said he was repeatedly going in and out of that tunnel at an accelerating pace, building up towards a huge, um, exultation, and also specified that the warm succoring light was unusually moist and concentrated solely on his genitals, I began to have my doubts. Working in this field, you hear stories about the terminally ill meeting God or talking to deceased relatives every day, so on the face of it this wouldn't have been that unusual. However, once Trevor mentioned that all of the angels he saw had huge, oiled-up boobs, it was pretty clear this was just a nocturnal ejaculation." Powell was heard to say that Heaven was stickier than he had expected, just moments before being told that his book deal with Saving Grace Publishers Group had been rescinded.

FDA Approves Of What New Drug Is Going For
WASHINGTON — Officials at the Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday that they approve of the basic direction Pfizer's new drug Ribastrol is headed in. "We like what you guys are trying to do here: kind of a Zoloft thing with some Levitra-esque undertones thrown in there, too," said Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, adding that the FDA essentially dug Ribastrol's general vibe. "We encourage all of you at Pfizer to play around with it a bit and tighten up some of its chemical configurations. And then, you know, get back to us. " Hamburg said the FDA also recommends that Pfizer check out what the folks over at Novartis have been doing lately, because it might be right up their alley.

Woman In Ninth Year Of Letting Boyfriend Down Easy
CHICAGO — Saying she wanted to "end things the right way" and not leave any painful, unresolved issues lingering between them, area woman Deborah Oster confirmed Wednesday she has been letting boyfriend Greg Norfolk down easy for the past nine years. "Greg's such a sweetheart; breaking things off suddenly would just be too cruel," said Oster, who began emotionally distancing herself from Norfolk in 2003 after concluding they just weren't cut out for a long-term relationship. "I know it won't be easy for him, but this year I think it's time for me to sit Greg down, tell him we need to talk, and then gently broach the subject of how we both might benefit from a little more alone time. Then, three years from now, I'll be able to bring up the idea of seeing other people, explaining that it could be a way for us to learn more about ourselves and improve our own relationship. That should pave the way for me to suggest we take a break in 2017." Sources confirmed Norfolk has no plans to tell Oster that he has been regularly cheating on her for the past seven years.

Bar Band To Pay Dearly For Slipping In Original Song
PHILADELPHIA — Grossly underestimating the patience of their audience, rock-and-blues band Flashback Depot was going to pay dearly Thursday for attempting to perform an original song during their hour-long set. "Some people say we sound a little like the E Street Band, but we'll let you be the judge of that," said frontman Eric Saunders, who would forever rue the moment he decided to add a new self-penned single to the band's lineup of rock standards, prompting dozens of patrons to step outside for a smoke break and several more to close their bar tabs as the group squandered the goodwill it had built during the past half hour by playing adequate covers of "All Small Things" and "Personal Jesus." "We've actually never played this one live, so it might be a little shaky." The band was eventually escorted out of the bar after debuting a six-minute power ballad written by their drummer.

I'm Going To Make A Great Mom Someday
I've been doing a lot of thinking about my future lately: what kind of life I want to have, what kind of person I want to be, all that stuff. It seems like nowadays, women are more concerned with having a successful career and being independent for a while than they are with settling down and raising a family. The world's a changing place, after all, and you wouldn't necessarily think that a single woman in her 20s such as myself would ever dream of having children. But I have to say, the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced it's something I want to do. I really think I was born to be a mom. And when I do have a baby of my own, I just know I'm going to be the best mom in the whole world! Now, I know what you're thinking: "Casey, what would a young, pretty, unattached girl like yourself want with a baby?" Fair point. I am only 26 years old, after all! Nevertheless, I have to say, as I've gotten older the idea of having a baby has started to seem more and more appealing to me. Lately, it's been on my mind a lot, in fact: the nursery, the baby carriage, the cozy little cradle — I want it all! I can already picture myself outfitting my baby with all sorts of cute little clothes and toys. That all just sounds like so much fun. And I really think I'm going to be wonderful at it. It's weird to even be admitting this, of course, because I never thought I'd feel this way. After all, there was a time in my life when I wasn't sure motherhood was really for me. The idea of having a baby just seemed like such a drag, you know? All the little chores and responsibilities. And on top of it all, I didn't even really like babies! I just had to sort of play along when other people would see a baby and talk about how cute it was. I remember thinking, "Ugh, no way! Not for me!" I don't know, though. I guess I get it now. My maternal instinct must have kicked in hardcore or something, because I am all about the idea of motherhood these days. I'm not saying I'm ready to have a baby tomorrow or anything. Having a baby isn't something you should just rush into. But some day in the future I definitely want to be a mom, and when it does happen, you guys, I'm seriously going to be the best mom in the world. You have no idea. I am going to just spoil my kid rotten! I'll want to find the right guy, of course, which I imagine won't be too difficult. I'm a bit of a catch, if I do say so myself! Granted, having a baby is a big responsibility, and it's not a decision to be made lightly. You definitely have to make sure your finances and your personal life are in order first before you just suddenly decide to have a baby. That's why I'm going to be prepared when I have mine, whenever that time comes. I just want my baby to have the best possible life, because nothing will be more important than that. I'm even going to read all of the baby books so that I will be like an expert in having a baby! Just call me Supermommy. For the time being, though, there's no reason to rush into things. I've got plenty of time to think this through. I'm thinking I'll wait until I'm maybe 28 or 29 and then that should be about the perfect time. I just want to make sure I do this right. God, I hope it's a girl. Casey Anthony

Bend In Road Not Sharp Enough To Merit So Many Roadside Memorials
CRYSTAL RIVER, FL — Claiming he found the turn to be well banked and cambered with perfect sightlines, motorist Calvin Henry declared Wednesday that a bend along Florida State Road 44 was definitely not sharp enough to warrant the dozen or so roadside memorials along its outside shoulder. "I mean, this is a pretty soft turn," said Henry, noting that the section of road in question was barely even noticeable as far as highway curves were concerned, let alone a deathtrap deserving so many combined remembrances and warnings. "Would you look at all these plastic flowers and white crosses? Either the people around here don't know how to drive or they're just goofing around. It's not like there's even a steep drop on the other side of the shoulder. Seriously, people, calm down — I could take this curve at 80 without breaking a sweat." Henry was unavailable for further comment, having become so distracted by the abundance of memorials that suffered a violent single-car accident.

Panicked Oyster Praying That Lump It Feels Forming Only A Pearl
PORTLAND, ME — Reassuring herself that the lump she felt forming between her fleshy mantle and hard outer shell was almost certainly not worth panicking over, a Pemaquid oyster prayed fervently Wednesday that the growth was merely a pearl. "I'm sure this is nothing, but I don't remember noticing it until the other day, and it's really bugging me," said the mollusk, speculating that perhaps she was actually making it worse by nervously opening and closing her shell to examine the small, rigid bump. "I hope it will just go away on its own, but it actually looks bigger this morning, and it's been there less than a week. I think my aunt had an issue with this sort of thing once, but it turned out to be a sphere of calcium carbonate covered with a thin layer of lustrous nacre, so I shouldn't get myself too worked up over it. It's just so easy to automatically assume the worst. I'll get it checked first thing after the weekend." At press time, the lump was confirmed to be a small pearl after the oyster was harvested and shucked.

Camp Counselor Assigning Kids To Horses Like Wise Town Matchmaker Presiding Over Marriage
POLAND, ME — Studying the youngsters in front of the stable as if she alone possessed the insight into who belonged with whom, Rockbrook Camp counselor Melissa Burke, 19, reportedly assigned kids to horses in a beginner horseback riding class Thursday like a sage town matchmaker presiding over marriage arrangements. "Sarah, I think Nutmeg would be perfect for you — he's a nice, kind horse," said Burke, who skillfully paired the 11- and 12-year-olds with horses by character and temperament as if they were village sons and daughters for whom she was shrewdly brokering a wedding dowry. "Oh, and Alicia? You should be with Cookie. He's a little anxious, but I bet you'll be able to calm him down just fine." At press time, Burke was guiding a shy camper toward a rambunctious horse named Shadow as though she were a naïve maiden being pressured into wedding the town's most drunken and irritable landowner.

Report: Majority Of Time In Pool Spent Urging Others To Enter Pool
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ — Far outstripping the amount of time dedicated to swimming or games, a report released Wednesday by researchers at Rutgers University found that the average person in a pool spends the vast majority of their time urging others to enter as well. "Across demographic groups, we found that an individual will typically spend 80 percent of their time in a pool engaged in various efforts to coax others into joining them in the water," read the report, noting that roughly half that time is dedicated to making the case that entering the pool will be "fun" or "refreshing" and about a third is allocated toward playful commands or taunts such as "Come on," "Stop being a baby," or simply "Just get in already." "The smallest amount of time is reserved for more aggressive tactics such as splashing people from the pool's edge or just reaching up and pulling them in if they get close enough." The report went on to say that any time not spent urging others to enter the pool was devoted to awkwardly bobbing in the water while waiting for people to enter on their own.

Priest Cursed With Incredible Penis
NEW MILTON, WV — Asking whether possession of an exceptional sexual organ he was forbidden to use was perhaps a test from the Lord, local Roman Catholic priest Russell Calhoun reportedly lamented Tuesday the fact that God cursed him with an incredible penis. "Why, oh, why would the Lord demand chastity of a man upon whom He has bestowed this magnificent, perfectly sculpted cock?" Calhoun said as he questioned why God, in His infinite wisdom, had called such an exquisitely hung man to the priesthood, thereby requiring him to cloister away 10 inches of spectacular phallus that could otherwise be used to bring untold sexual pleasure to others. "It seems selfish to hide away a gift like this magnificent dong and not share it with the world, but I must trust that it is all part of God's plan. Much like Jonah and his power of prophecy, my blessing is also my burden, for I would surely be deep-dickin' untold numbers of men and women right now were it not for the strictures of my vocation." At press time, sources confirmed Father Calhoun was taking solace in the fact that, if nothing else, at least several of his church's altar boys were blessed with the opportunity to gaze upon his sublime penis once a week.

Report: Rise In Global Temperatures Likely To Increase Number of Americans Who Fucking Reek
WASHINGTON — Sounding the alarm on yet another devastating effect of climate change, a report released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that even a modest rise in global temperatures is likely to increase the number of Americans who fucking reek. "If the upward trend in average global temperature continues, we'll almost certainly see a corresponding uptick in the proportion of Americans who just stink like rancid cheese," said lead author Roger Agnew, explaining that with each degree centigrade the climate warms, the number of Americans who can singlehandedly clear out a room with their B.O. grows exponentially. "Our models project that the heat trapped by elevated levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause as many as 50 million Americans to develop an unbearably ripe stench capable of wafting as far as the Canadian border. We must ask ourselves: Do we want our children to inherit a world that smells like total ass?" Fanning the air in front of his nose, Agnew emphasized that climate change was real and that the effects of it could already be detected.

Report: There An Adult Superstore Off Exit 16
COLUMBIA, SC — Observing that southbound motorists should begin to come across signs just after passing the rest area, sources reported Wednesday that there is an adult superstore off exit 16. "Yeah, so what you do is, you just hang a left at the end of that off-ramp and it's pretty much across from the McDonald's and down a ways from the Holiday Inn," said one local source speaking on condition of anonymity. "If you hit the Party City or the fireworks place, you've gone too far. There's one called X-Site off of mile marker 177, too, but the Adult Central Superstore is the one you want. Two floors. They got toys, DVDs, mags, everything. There used to be a decent one called Lion's Den if you get off U.S. 76 and take the frontage road way down past Hardee's, but lately, it's kind of for shit. I'd just go to Adult Central. Closer anyway." The source further urged interested parties to find out when Bud's working, as he can hook you up with a 30-minute viewing booth session if you buy more than $50 of DVDs.

Man Methodically Explains Origin Behind Every Poster Hanging In Apartment
CHICAGO — Detailing the extensive backstories of the wall hangings and how he came to acquire them, local man Richard Minhas was methodically explaining Thursday the origin of every poster hanging in his apartment. "This one over here is a print of a Japanese woodblock I got from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and then the one right next to it is a vintage Tylenol advertisement I picked up at a garage sale," said Minhas, ushering his guest around the 750-square-foot space, stopping by the placards, which included an old-timey map of Arizona and a reproduction of a 1977 Fleetwood Mac tour poster, to elucidate their content as well as his personal connection to the pieces. "I really like this French movie The Wages Of Fear, so I placed it next to this other poster for Bicycle Thieves, since they're both movies. As for these ones in the kitchen, this is a taxonomic chart cataloguing a bunch of varieties of mushrooms, this one is the same thing but with spices, this one is a diagram of a cow showing all the cuts of beef, and then this is an old sign advertising fresh tomatoes I got at a farmers market." After he finished explaining all the posters, Minhas reportedly expounded on every keepsake on his bookshelf.

Man Spends Long Day At Work Waiting To Go Home And Be Lonely
BALTIMORE — Sighing in exasperation and repeatedly checking the clock as he completed a number of menial tasks, area man Alan Stover confirmed Wednesday he had spent a long day at work waiting until he could finally go home and be lonely. "It's so annoying having to be here in the office doing all this tedious paperwork when I could be sitting there all alone in my empty apartment," said Stover, telling reporters he was "counting down the minutes" until he could at long last go home, stretch out on the sofa, and just feel hollow inside for the rest of the evening. "By the time I get out of the afternoon meeting and finish all these spreadsheets, I'll be lucky if I can still putter around my apartment, eat leftover takeout in front of the microwave, vacantly scroll through Netflix, blearily mutter 'time for bed' to myself, and fall asleep before I have to start the whole thing over again tomorrow. God, it feels like five o'clock will never come." At press time, Stover was reportedly frustrated after his evening plans were ruined by a text inviting him to a bar for a friend's birthday.

Poor Attendance At Intervention A Real Wake-Up Call
LAWTON, OK — Brought to the brink of tears by the concerned looks in the eyes of a few of his loved ones, Alex Sheehorn, 29, was presented with a serious wake-up call Wednesday in the form of the piss-poor attendance at his intervention. "I walked into my place to find Mom, Dad, and my Aunt Carla standing there, plus the mediator. The self-realization I've been avoiding for months hit me like a ton of bricks — for my own good, before it's too late, I desperately need to get my social life on track," said Sheehorn, who was forced to face how far gone he is when his sisters Meghan and Candice texted 45 minutes late to say they couldn't attend. "Knowing that hardly anyone showed up for me in my darkest moments is exactly the motivation I need to make big changes. Starting today, no more excuses. I refuse to let my addiction prevent me from finally making more friends at work or my rec basketball league." Sheehorn has since made a resolution to throw away his pills and find a more social drug to abuse.

Man's Wife Dies Of Cancer Just Like In The Movies
HUDSON, NY — Expressing shock to find himself in a situation from the silver screen, local man Kevin Perry revealed Wednesday that his wife had died from stage-3 lymphoma just like in a Hollywood movie. "Man oh man, look at little old me, recently bereaved and struggling with a deep sense of loss like I'm smack dab out of some sort of Oscar-winning motion picture," said Perry, adding that everything from his time weeping at his partner's bedside as she slipped into a coma to his heart-wrenching speech at her funeral had felt like a melodrama directed by some moviemaking bigshot like Mr. Steven Spielberg himself. "When the doctor came in to tell me the bad news, I thought, 'C'mon, this has got to be a put-on, right?' I mean, I've seen this scene in celluloid about a hundred times in the theater. Honestly, I kept waiting for someone to shout out 'Cut!' and have a director walk out from behind one of the hospital screens. Who even knew this sort of thing happened in real life?" Perry added that he was already blushing at the idea of starring in his own personal drama about his slide into clinical depression as if he were one of the stars of tinseltown like Casey Affleck or Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Dog Who Successfully Detected Cancer In Owner Put Down For Practicing Medicine Without A License
PHOENIX — In what authorities hope serves as a warning to any domesticated animal who places medical patients at risk, Kuma, 3, a German shepherd who successfully detected cancer in his owner, was put down Thursday for practicing medicine without a license. "Although in this particular case the animal's actions did save a life, this dog is not only in blatant violation of medical standards but has been conducting a de facto illegal medical practice, which we cannot condone," Judge Marlena Peters said during the dog's sentencing, clarifying that Kuma's clear lack of medical education, certification, or experience posed a potential danger to those around him, and that his masquerade as a medical professional was deeply insulting to licensed doctors and nurses everywhere. "The fact that this dog's diagnosis happened to be correct in this isolated case does not absolve him of the crime of fraudulent practice. We must eradicate any and all dogs who practice medicine illegally in order to ensure standards within the medical community are maintained." Judge Peters is currently engaged in the sentencing of a cat convicted of obstruction of justice for repeatedly interfering with the investigation into its owner's homicide.

Woman Confident She Has The Safety Net It Takes To Achieve Dreams
LOS ANGELES — Citing her can-do spirit, belief in her own talents, and considerable trust fund, aspiring screenwriter and playwright Dasha Rothwell confirmed Monday that she was confident she had the safety net it would take to achieve her dreams. "I truly feel I have what it takes to pursue my creative and personal goals here in a big city. Even if it means pounding the pavement in my Lexus hybrid, only dining out five or six times a week, and forking out that much more for rent each month, I'll just buckle down, grit my teeth, and ask my parents for the extra cash," said Rothwell, 24, stressing that she's not afraid of failure or having to start back at square one, as she would suffer no financial or material repercussions whatsoever in doing so. "Look, I know that there are huge risks involved in dropping everything to chase your dreams, but I'm more willing to go out on that ledge than most people, because I have faith in my dream and in the financial advisors who are ready to cushion my fall." At press time, the rejection of her script by two studios had forced Rockwell to consider a return home in disgrace to New York, where she would put aside her dreams and help run her family's multi-million-dollar investment firm.

Gimp Tied To Pole On Curb Outside Coffee Shop While Owner Inside
CHICAGO — Concerned about the welfare of the "cold and kind of lonely-looking" submissive chained to a street sign outside of a coffee shop, sympathetic passersby discussed the ethics Friday of leaving one's gimp tied to a pole while one buys a latte. "It's really cold out here, especially with this wind, and the poor little painslut's wearing rhinestone-studded leather chaps," said passerby Lee Schroeder of the disoriented masochist whose neglectful master had emerged from the shop only once in a two-hour period to perfunctorily whip him and piss in his mouth. "Should I go over and see if he's okay, maybe fist him a little? I considered cock-and-ball torturing him earlier, but you never know if these little guys are gonna bite. God, my heart always breaks when I see a fucktoy all by himself, barking 'Spank me, Daddy!' over and over while his dom is inside wearing noise-cancelling headphones." Observers were later able to breathe a sigh of relief as the gimp's owner came out, untied him, and ran a Wartenberg pinwheel over his nipples.

Woman Amazed She Found Perfect Partner Just When She Was Getting Desperate Enough To Accept Anything
ELKINS PARK, PA — Saying that "the universe works in mysterious ways," local woman Rebecca Ellis claimed Monday to be amazed at how she found the perfect partner just when she was getting desperate enough to accept anything. "Who would have thought I'd find the most perfect guy for me at almost the same instant I lowered my standards to a level I'd once have found unthinkable? I mean, what are the odds?" said Ellis, 28, marvelling at the timing involved in meeting her soulmate mere days after resolving not to spend another winter alone. "There I was, unimaginably lonely and quickly running out of options in this backward town, when suddenly Kevin barges through that door and fills the recently created Kevin-shaped void in my heart." At press time, Ellis was overwhelmed with gratitude upon landing her dream job mere weeks after lowering her salary requirements and to giving up hope of getting decent health benefits.

Rush Limbaugh Tucks Shirt Back In Following Animated Flat Tax Rant
WEST PALM BEACH, FL — While ferociously laying into what he calls the "liberal jihad against the flat tax," conservative pundit and talk radio host Rush Limbaugh dislodged his shirt from the waistband of his pants Tuesday, leaving it to flap wildly about his midsection for the rest of his impassioned four-minute tirade. "Hrrp — hrrp," a panting Limbaugh said before sitting back down, wiping off the microphone, and taking a moment to swallow the thick, viscous phlegm he had inadvertently dislodged during the heated monologue. "It just defies all logic how — hhugh…. Is that blood? " On the advice of his producer, Limbaugh quickly drank a glass of water and ate a banana before addressing Obama's failed commerce secretary appointees.

AVONDALE, OH — Confessing that her grief was somewhat moderated by seeing events play out exactly as she had warned, local mother Deborah Klein said Thursday she felt somewhat vindicated upon learning that her teenage daughter Rachel, after staying out later than parental rules allowed, had been murdered. "Sure, Rachel's violent murder is not at all my desired outcome, but if I'm honest, it feels good to say 'I told you so,' even if it's just to the bedroom she'll never come home to again," said Klein, adding that her daughter would often "pooh-pooh" repeated warnings that nothing good ever happens after midnight and disregarded entreaties to call in often with her location. "I would, of course, do anything in this world to get my sweet baby girl back, but it's also nice to know I wasn't being insane or unreasonable or mean, as some young people have been known to say, when I told her that we have curfews for a reason. Yes, this major tragedy will shatter me and I'll never be whole again, but sometimes kids have to learn the hard way." Klein later added that she intends to mention Rachel daily as a warning to her surviving children.

Woman Amazed She Found Perfect Partner Just When She Was Getting Desperate Enough To Accept Anything
ELKINS PARK, PA — Saying that "the universe works in mysterious ways," local woman Rebecca Ellis claimed Monday to be amazed at how she found the perfect partner just when she was getting desperate enough to accept anything. "Who would have thought I'd find the most perfect guy for me at almost the same instant I lowered my standards to a level I'd once have found unthinkable? I mean, what are the odds?" said Ellis, 28, marvelling at the timing involved in meeting her soulmate mere days after resolving not to spend another winter alone. "There I was, unimaginably lonely and quickly running out of options in this backward town, when suddenly Kevin barges through that door and fills the recently created Kevin-shaped void in my heart." At press time, Ellis was overwhelmed with gratitude upon landing her dream job mere weeks after lowering her salary requirements and to giving up hope of getting decent health benefits.

Chemistry Teacher Encouraging Students To Fuck Around With Bunsen Burners In Last-Ditch Effort To Prove Science Is Cool
COLUMBUS, OH — In what was interpreted as a final attempt to foster scientific curiosity in high school juniors, James A. Garfield Memorial High School chemistry teacher Gary Holbrook encouraged his students Monday to fuck around with Bunsen burners in a last-ditch effort to prove that science is cool. "As you can see by my demonstration, you can pour any chemicals you'd like into your round-bottomed flask — sulfuric acid, nitrogen, mercury — and just crank up the heat," said Holbrook, evidently hoping to instill an appetite for science in his students by allowing them to just open cupboards in the lab and mix up whichever chemicals seemed the coolest to them. "Oh, also — if you're curious about relative specific heats of common household materials versus those of organic tissues, you and your lab partner can stick a paperclip over the flame, and take turns branding each other. Really get that thing glowing hot. As far as we know, this is how all great chemists discovered their passion for lab work." Holbrook declared his approach a qualified success after his students became sufficiently interested in science to ignite a hydrogen-filled balloon, burning down the school laboratory.

Recently Divorced 40-Year-Old Struggling To Navigate College Dating Scene
COLUMBUS, OH — Noting that the contemporary romantic vibe was totally different than the one he experienced in the late Clinton era, recently divorced advertising copywriter Richard Hamlin, 40, admitted Wednesday that he was struggling to navigate the college dating scene. "It's not easy jumping back into the acton, especially when you have all these new apps to learn," said Hamlin, remarking that everything from the music to the entire composition of Main Street had completely changed in the decades since he was dating his ex-wife. "Sometimes, I even find myself thinking that I have nothing in common with these 19-year-olds. When I show up at the bar, nobody seems to want to talk to me. It used to come so naturally, but now, when I ask someone about their major, they become uncomfortable and sort of melt away the first chance they get. I never thought I would say this, but I'm definitely considering joining a frat." A dejected Hamlin later reported negative results from an attempt to "up his game" by spending $7 to load the jukebox with 45 straight minutes of Spin Doctors.

Scientists Make Unclear Breakthrough After Giving Robot Cancer
STANFORD, CA — Theorizing that their work most likely represents a groundbreaking scientific achievement of some kind, researchers at Stanford University announced Thursday that they have made an unclear breakthrough by giving a robot cancer. The team of oncologists and mechanical engineers told reporters that after years of research and repeated trials, they had finally succeeded in causing an aggressive form of advanced cancer to spread throughout a laboratory robot's mechanized arm and central processing unit, noting that this landmark accomplishment probably has beneficial implications for the scientific community or society at large "or something like that." "Right now, what we can absolutely say for sure is that this robot has Stage IV cancer and only has two to three months left until it succumbs to the disease." "Diagnostic testing has confirmed that our robot has developed a high concentration of malignancies throughout its entire structural framework, which, for all we know, could turn out to be incredibly important to science," said lead researcher Amos Cruise, noting that the degenerative disease is corroding the machine's circuitry at a rapid rate, a development that he stated might potentially lead to further advancements in cancer research or robotics or maybe electrical engineering. "Never before has cancer been detected in a non-biological entity, which seems like a pretty big achievement to me. I mean, it took three years of experimentation just to get cancer to take hold inside a robot, and anything that requires that much effort probably ends up being pretty useful, I imagine." "Right now, what we can absolutely say for sure is that this robot has Stage IV cancer and only has two to three months left until it succumbs to the disease," Cruise added. "That alone has got to be some sort of leap forward in our understanding of terminal illnesses. Right?" According to Cruise, after introducing cancerous neoplasms into the robot's microprocessors, the disease eventually metastasized from its motherboard to its sensor modules and chassis, an unprecedented expansion that researchers said had never been observed before and therefore would have to be categorized as a success in some sense. Just six weeks later, the Stanford team reported that the disease had completely disabled the robot's optical and pneumatic systems in a progression that several of the project's top epidemiologists haltingly called a watershed moment in "whatever scientific discipline covers this sort of thing." Additionally, sources confirmed that the rapidly proliferating disease had degraded the integrity of the unit's electrical wiring by 70 percent, with Cruise asserting that, while such a development didn't immediately suggest any practical applications for cancer treatment, it certainly seemed like something worth noting. He added that initial tests have revealed that the robot's cancer is inoperable, which he stressed was probably a pretty meaningful detail as well. "We've begun administering an aggressive course of chemotherapy drugs and are putting the robot through daily radiotherapy sessions to see how it responds to the treatment, because we figured, you know, that seemed like a pretty logical thing to do at this point," said Cruise, noting that while the robot's condition continues to decline, monitoring its reaction to concentrated doses of toxic radiation "might be one of those things that pays off somewhere down the line." "Meanwhile, we're also applying for additional funding in order to someday replicate our findings in other robots by giving them cancer, and maybe some other diseases too. That's the type of thing we usually do during projects like this, so I guess we'll try that and see how it goes. Can't hurt." "Maybe if we can build a robot that already has cancer, it could…" he added, before trailing off. When reached for further comment, Stanford's research team confirmed that, in what just has to be a crucial finding for artificial intelligence or possibly a related field, they have determined that the robot is fully aware it has cancer and is in constant pain.

Cure For Cancer Only 10 Years Away, Announce Scientists Who Work Better Under A Deadline
CAMBRIDGE — Admitting that setting clear goalposts would help them with their tendency to procrastinate, scientists at Harvard University who work better under a deadline announced Tuesday that a cure for cancer was only 10 years away. "Okay, we're coming out and saying, right now, that cancer will be completely eradicated by 2028," said lead researcher Hana Ward, telling reporters that now that they'd committed to a timeline, it would really push them to stop messing around and get to work. "We've all put it in our calendars, so we should be good to go. As soon as we're done with this press conference, it's going to be all curing cancer all the time. We urge Americans to remind us of our commitment and really hold our feet to the fire about this to ensure we're not slacking off. To be on the safe side, we'd recommend that you check back in with us in five years or so to make sure we're still on track." Ward added that her team actually had a couple quick things to take care of, but they'd be really putting their noses to the grindstone come next week.

Beloved Father And Infrequent Pornography User Loses 3-Year Battle With Cancer
ROCHESTER, NY — After losing a three-year battle with prostate cancer during which he only sporadically masturbated to prurient images, beloved father and infrequent pornography user Larry Gates passed away Monday, surrounded by his loving family in the home where he kept one or two old Playboys which, when in better health, he would take out from the bottom of a desk drawer and beat off to every so often. A true leader in business, an eight-year member of the Rochester Park School Board, and a devoted family man who browsed the "co-ed," "amateur," and "busty" categories every six months or so, Gates leaves behind his adoring sons William, 22, and Henry, 18; daughters Megan, 20, and Sidney, 14; PornHub link "Busty Amateur Co-ed Squirts Everywhere," bookmarked last November; and his wife of 27 years, Elizabeth Marie. Those close to the sporadic X-rated movie downloader knew him as a company man who spent 17 years as an accountant at the Bonadio Group and four hours last year looking at POV blowjob GIFs, a devoted church-going member of his community, and an avid fan of both the New York Mets and of occasionally pleasuring himself to still images of interracial threesomes. Gates was 53, but discovered pornography at 13.

Department Of Education Study Finds Only 30% Of Students Adequately Prepared For Spring Musical
WASHINGTON — Examining data obtained from thousands of reportedly lackluster rehearsals across the country, a new study released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Education concluded that a mere 30 percent of students are adequately prepared for the spring musical. "Our analysis found that, with tech week right around the corner, less than a third of leads in American public schools have their lines off-book, their scene blocking down pat, or their solos anywhere close to performance-ready," said department spokesperson Larry Tan, who noted that a scant 26 percent of high school cast members can land their kick-ball-changes, while just 15 percent are able to complete proper box steps, bell kicks, or pivot turns. "Despite the best efforts of educators, most lighting techs have not yet learned their cues, only a fraction of crews are finished with the main set pieces, and nearly every pit orchestra in the nation is still rushing the opening number. The majority of students have been practicing since February, but based on the frankly embarrassing dress rehearsals our researchers witnessed, you could be forgiven for thinking auditions were just a week or two ago." Tan went on to say that unless schools make significant improvements soon, the nation's youth will be vastly underprepared for a life in community theater.

'It's Like You're Hearing Me But You're Not Listening To Me,' Says Man To Representative On Oscar Mayer Customer Service Hotline
BUFFALO GROVE, IL — Emphasizing that communication was a "two-way street," local man Thomas Ross expressed concern Monday that he was being heard, but not listened to by a representative taking his call on the Oscar Mayer customer service hotline. "I just keep talking and talking, and it's like you're not even listening at all," said Ross, adding that it hurt him deeply to have his vulnerability met with such callous indifference by a customer service representative who he had assumed cared about him. "What about what I want, Reggie? Is it too much to ask for a three-cheese hotdog? All you do is offer platitudes and pretend like we haven't had this conversation a dozen times before. You should at least have the balls to give it to me straight, Reggie! I think you owe me that much." At press time, Ross accused the representative of exploiting a power imbalance in their relationship by bringing his manager into the fold.

Middlebury Vermont Town Council Continues 242-Year Tradition Of American Democracy With 4-1 Vote To Rezone Lot For New Popeyes
MIDDLEBURY, VT — Following in the hallowed and time-honored civic footsteps of their forefathers, Middlebury town council members continued the 242-year tradition of American democracy Monday with 4-1 vote in favor of rezoning a residential lot to accommodate a new Popeyes Chicken franchise. "I'm always happy to support local businesses, but this new Popeyes would dramatically increase traffic along Route 22, which is already backed up as it is," said city councillor Ben Calvi, exercising his inalienable right to stand against the majority and, in the process, doing his part to write the next chapter in the story of American freedom. "That intersection already takes forever to get through, and it's going to be way too busy now." At press time, experts on constitutional law heaped praise on the newly opened Popeyes in a tradition whose roots reach back over 25 centuries to Solon of Athens.

Man Hates Having To Wear Condoms All Day Every Day
FORT COLLINS, CO — Decrying the contraceptive device as an uncomfortable inconvenience, local man Michael Franklin revealed Thursday that he hates having to wear condoms all day every day. "It just doesn't feel natural, and I barely get any sensation when I'm going about my day," said Franklin, complaining that the latex contraceptive was too tight and hurt his penis while attempting to finish various tasks at home and work. "I just don't like to feel anything between me and the fabric of my boxers, and that latex smell is kind of gross to deal with 24/7. But I want to be safe and responsible, so I just put up with it. At least I know I'm protected when I'm walking down the street or am at the office." At press time, an embarrassed Franklin was apologizing and asking his coworkers to wait "just a second" after his condom fell off and slid down his pant leg during a presentation.

Loser Woman Hasn't Even Inspired One Bar Fight
DENVER, CO — Noting that the pathetic 30-year-old may as well have been invisible to the men around her, sources confirmed Monday that loser woman Kathleen Owens has never inspired even a single bar fight. "Strangely, the sight of Kathleen failed to motivate even a single guy to pick up a pool cue and smash it over the head of another guy while competing for her attention," said a source close to Owens, emphasizing confusion as to how any female could inspire such indifference among men, let alone instigate by her very presence exactly zero bar-wide brawls resulting in the bartender firing a shotgun into the ceiling as a warning to the dozens of desire-crazed men violently competing for her favor. "Not once have I seen two men sidle up to her at the bar at the same time, say 'Seat taken?' in accidental unison, and trade insults that escalate into a shoving match until a third suitor approaches, smashes the heads of the first two together, and sits down triumphantly beside her. She's just hopeless. What's wrong with her?" At press time, Owens was seen sighing between drinks of her cocktail as a fight erupted among the bar's male customers over whose turn it was to play darts.

Area Man Institutes T-Shirt Purchase Freeze
PORTLAND, OR — While standing in front of his open closet, Ken Ciszek announced Tuesday that he is instituting a T-shirt purchasing freeze until further notice. "Although I love and have always loved T-shirts, the time has come to halt their acquisition," Ciszek said. "This includes T-shirts that feature bands and movies I like, locations I have visited, sports teams I support, causes I endorse, and phrases I find funny. Ciszek said he has been buying T-shirts since high school. "When I was a kid, I'd pick one up at every concert," Ciszek said. "Then, in college, I started buying them from thrift stores or getting them at political rallies. The 29-year-old restaurant manager instituted his T-shirt-buying freeze when he realized he had so many T-shirts that he had lost track of his holdings. "I found a great Cheap Trick Dream Police tour shirt at a garage sale," Ciszek said. "I couldn't believe my luck, but then I got home and realized I had one exactly like it buried under my other band T-shirts. Until I can figure out what to do with these things, I'm cutting myself off. It'll be hard, but I gotta do it. Ciszek keeps the T-shirts that he wears most frequently hung in his closet. His second-tier T-shirts are kept folded on top of his dresser, which is filled with third- and fourth-tier T-shirts. Ciszek also has a box of T-shirts under his bed. "There are ones I haven't worn in, like, four years," Ciszek said. "Some of them are riddled with holes. Some are so old that they're practically translucent. I have a 'Don't Mess With Texas' T-shirt that's so faded, the logo isn't even there anymore. It's just an outline of the state. Added Ciszek: "But I love it, and I just can't bring myself to throw it out, until it falls completely apart or is ripped from my back. Ciszek first recognized his problem in August, when his washing machine broke and he was able to go six weeks without needing to wash a T-shirt. Though he could easily donate his less-favored shirts to charity or throw them away, Ciszek said he is at a loss. "Which ones can I get rid of? " said Ciszek, standing over a pile of shirts on his bed. "I mean, they all have sentimental value. This Old Milwaukee shirt I got to cheer myself up after I broke my leg in 2000. Here's one from a Fun Run I got roped into doing once. This one has a fish on it — I got it at a gas station. This one says 'We're All Earnest.' I have no idea what that even means, but the old telephone on it looks really cool. Ciszek received some of the T-shirts in his wardrobe as gifts. "This one is from the camp that my friend Jake worked at over the summer," Ciszek said. "My sister bought me this one at Disney World — I don't even like it, really, but I keep it because it was nice that she thought of me. Oh, wow. There's still a price tag on it. At last count, Ciszek said he owned 132 T-shirts. The glut has gotten so out of control that he has been forced to turn down free T-shirts. "I was at a sneak preview for Kill Bill, and they were tossing free stuff into the audience," Ciszek said. "Just my luck, instead of a hat or a poster or something, a T-shirt landed right on my head. I gave it to the guy sitting next to me. That's something I never would have done a year ago. Ciszek's girlfriend, Faye Bullington, called the T-shirt purchase freeze "a step in the right direction. "If only I could just get him to start wearing shirts with buttons," Bullington said. "He's almost 30, but he still dresses like a 16-year-old. Is it really necessary for him to alert everyone on the street that he's been to San Diego?"

Brad Pitt Stumbles Across Old Cardboard Box With Gwyneth Paltrow's Head In Attic
LOS ANGELES — Making the discovery while searching his attic for a pair of rarely worn snow pants, actor Brad Pitt on Friday reportedly stumbled across an old cardboard box containing the severed head of Gwyneth Paltrow. "Oh man, I totally forgot about this up here! Right after we broke up I never wanted to see it again, but now I'm glad I held on to it — really takes me back to some good times," said Pitt, judging from the missing teeth and dented cranium that movers must have dropped the box at some point. "I remember when I had it up on my mantle for a while, until it was too painful to be around. [Morgan] Freeman is going to get a real kick out of it when I tell him." At press time, Pitt had decided to bring the head downstairs in case his kids wanted to play with it.

Woman In Waiting Area Feels Twinge Of Betrayal While Watching Her Hairdresser Making Small Talk With Another
CHICAGO — Increasingly confused and embittered after noticing several eerie similarities over the course of their chit-chat, local woman Carrie Vance reportedly felt a twinge of betrayal Friday while sitting in the waiting room of her local salon and watching her hairdresser make small talk with another customer. "What the hell? I thought we had something special," said Vance, looking on in horror as she overheard her hair stylist asking the other woman about her job and the weather just as the two of them had discussed at their first appointment three months earlier. "Now she's asking her where she's originally from? Wow, this sort of stings. We had such a nice conversation during my last haircut — I really thought she was opening up to me — and now it's clear it was all an act. God, I feel like such an idiot." At press time, Vance reported feeling "completely devastated" after her hairdresser began their follow-up appointment by repeating the exact same smalltalk as when they first met.

Button-Up Shirt Goes On Life-Changing Odyssey Around Dry Cleaner's Garment Conveyor
FORT WAYNE, IN — Expressing astonishment at the transformative power of the journey, a button-up shirt reported Tuesday that it had gone on a truly life-changing odyssey around Forest Dry Cleaning's automated garment conveyor. "I have seen many wonders on my travels around this realm: cashmere wraps that are elegant beyond my wildest dreams; hand-knit Afghans from the far-flung Orient — even a storage container overflowing with collar stays," said the Oxford button-up, describing its 25-second circuit around the dry cleaner's one-track rail system as a "veritable Homerian voyage" replete with ecstatic highs and heart-racing lows that it would not soon forget. "Before I began this excursion, all I knew was the plastic-wrapped pair of Dockers before me and the wool cardigan behind. Yet now, having completed my trek, I can comprehend all of the richness and variety that makes up this enchanting kingdom of laundry." At press time, the frightened dress shirt had been stuffed into a trash bag by its owner and donated to charity after the dry cleaning process failed to remove a coffee stain on its breast pocket.

Picky Refugee Just Expects To Be Reunited With Exact Same Family As Before
MCALLEN, TX — Expressing frustration with the migrant child's sense of entitlement, ICE authorities confirmed Monday that picky Honduran refugee Blanca Diaz just expected to be reunited with the exact same family she had before. "We're already letting you go, and now you think you deserve special treatment and will just be automatically paired with whichever parents you want? Jesus, there's just no pleasing some people," said ICE agent Patrick Buecker of the 5-year-old girl who, after being forcibly separated from her parents and sisters at the border, was now "making such a huge deal" about the precise names, ages, and nationalities of the family members with whom she wished to rejoin. "We gave her a perfectly good mother and father and some siblings. They even spoke Spanish, but she just couldn't let it go that they happened to be from El Salvador. Come on, don't be such a diva — you're never going to be happy with such ridiculously high standards." At press time, Buecker was attempting to appease Diaz by throwing in an extra baby brother if she agreed to just take what was offered to her.

6th-Graders Feel Kind Of Bad After Seeing How Easy It Was To Make Young Teacher Cry
KAUKAUNA, WI — Given pause after witnessing the consequences of their actions, members of a sixth-grade class at River View Middle School reported feeling kind of bad Wednesday after discovering how little effort it took to make their teacher, 23-year-old Kayla Martin, cry. "Oh, jeez, now I feel guilty — I realize we were being a little bit mean to her, but I had no idea she was just gonna burst into tears like that," said student Daniel Rivera, 11, adding that he and his classmates "weren't even laying it on all that thick" when the first-year teacher turned off all the lights, yelled at them to put their heads down on their desks, and retreated to the back of the room, where she could be heard quietly weeping. "Sure, a few of us were deliberately talking over her every time she tried to speak. And Madison and her friends kept pointing and making fun of Ms. Martin's shoes. But she lost it in, like, half the time it used to take Mrs. Bergman to start crying. The poor young thing." At press time, the sixth-graders confirmed feeling absolutely terrible after Ms. Martin had wordlessly pressed play on an educational film about fossils and returned to sit at her desk in the dark.

Dog Meets Owner At Door In Desperate Attempt To Get Ahead Of Diarrhea-Rug Scandal
KENNEWICK, WA — Deftly maneuvering to control the emotional tone and establish the primacy of her own narrative before the story got out of control, 3-year-old Jack Russell terrier Muffin met her owner at the door upon his return from work Monday in a desperate attempt to get ahead of an unfolding diarrhea-riddled-living-room-rug scandal. The companion animal reportedly took quick action by enthusiastically leaping at her owner while wagging her tail and whining with supposed joy, attempting to mitigate the coming fallout over the discovery of the 2-by-5-foot slick of fecal liquefaction slowly drying mere feet away, and to present herself in the most positive light by nuzzling her owner's arm and licking his face. Moreover, Muffin immediately initiated a counter-narrative by scampering off to the dining room, grabbing the stuffed giraffe, and presenting it to her owner in a manner suggesting they play tug-of-war with the toy, evidently hoping that the creation of a favorable emotional atmosphere would soften the impact of the reeking cloud already wafting in from the next room. At press time, a severely chastised Muffin had instituted a total media blackout from beneath the bed, refusing to comment on her owner's disastrous slipping in the noisome, viscous mass or take any responsibility for the shirt and pants destroyed during his subsequent fall.

Praying Mantis Hesitantly Agrees To Try Girlfriend's Sexual Fantasy Of Eating His Head During Intercourse
CODAJÁS, BRAZIL — Saying that he was willing to try anything once, a praying mantis in the Amazon rainforest hesitantly agreed to his girlfriend's sexual fantasy of eating his head during sex, sources confirmed Thursday. "Honestly, I was a little wary when she first told me she was fantasizing about devouring my head, but I'm definitely trying to keep an open mind," said the mantis, noting that though he had reservations about the practice, he also respected his partner for feeling comfortable enough to open up to him about her head-eating kink. "A lot of guys would have just run in the other direction when they heard their girlfriend wanted to crack off their head in her mandibles and guzzle it for sustenance. But who knows, maybe I'll like it. Anyway, she promised she'd go slowly and that I could always stop her before she ate the rest of my body if I'm not into it." The mantis added that it was only fair that he be flexible given that his girlfriend had indulged his fetish of watching her flash the colored eyespots under her forewings during courtship.

Condo Board Maintains Purity Of Bloodline Through Generations Of Intermarriage
BLOOMINGDALE, FL — Citing the need to safeguard their highborn pedigree, the board of directors at local condominium development Oakwood Terrace told reporters Friday they have successfully maintained the purity of their bloodline through generations of intermarriage. According to residents, strict rules of peerage mandate that children of the five presiding condo board members must marry into one another's households, a practice that ensures that the oversight and proper maintenance of the 235-unit gated complex falls exclusively to legitimate offspring of strong stock. "We of the Oakwood Terrace Condominium Association will defend the integrity of our rule against all pretenders to the board," said sitting treasurer Norma Klein, who boasts heritage dating back to the original owners of Lot 1003 in Building Zone 2. "Years ago, my forebears accepted certain responsibilities when they paid the 20 percent preconstruction deposit on our ranch-style duplex. Today, it is our duty to preserve the chain of dynastic succession, and to justly enforce pet-leashing regulations and the one-vehicle-on-street parking rule." "Since the time of our founding, I'm proud to say that only a rightful heir has ever been granted the power to distribute keys to the pool area," Klein added. According to reports, the board's pristine lineage has largely been upheld through the arranged betrothal of marriageable sons and daughters, a process that involves intricate negotiations typically brokered at elite gatherings such as the subdivision's Fourth of July cookout, its annual golf tournament, and Saturday morning water aerobics. Through the strategic selection of spouses for their children, condo board directors are said to consolidate their grip on the interests they deem most vital, including who has access to the "OakTerr-Master" Excel spreadsheet that tracks dues payments, monitors the garbage pickup schedule, and records picnic pavilion reservations. "We married our firstborn to the Freeland clan of the Pine Court cul-de-sac near the tennis courts, and together we have forged a powerful alliance," said board vice president Loretta Shaw, a mother of three daughters who has been seen eyeing one of Walt Foreman's boys, a son of pure breeding with an uncle on the landscaping committee. "But relations between our two houses have been strained since last spring, when [condo board secretary] Sarah [Freeland] sabotaged my motion to have the front gate and mailbox station repainted." "Regardless, my daughters must have husbands with only the most honorable blood in their veins. A lesser match would not befit a family who wields control of the neighborhood sinking fund and appoints judges to preside over the holiday lighting contest." "Regardless, my daughters must have husbands with only the most honorable blood in their veins," she continued. "A lesser match would not befit a family who wields control of the neighborhood sinking fund and appoints judges to preside over the holiday lighting contest." Sources confirmed the engagement of a child to any lowborn spouse who cannot trace his or her lineage back to at least the development's third phase of construction would be social suicide for a board member. By all accounts, Oakwood Terrace was scandalized six years ago, when the scion of the recreation coordinator's family eloped with a "usurping harlot" from a timeshare property on the other side of Route 640. The clubhouse where the directors convene every other Thursday to discuss pressing matters of the condo association has long been full of intrigue, according to minutes-keeper Allan Snyder, whose family has for multiple generations recorded the most minor detail of every meeting in a word-processing document that dates back to the reign of legendary board president Bruce Dalton. "As you might well expect, the power to schedule routine lawn pesticide treatments does not change hands peaceably," Snyder said. "May God protect the ruling families of Oakwood Terrace and their sacred right to decree that each unit — whether detached home or multifamily dwelling — be painted only in the colors of the realm!" "Tan with white trim," he added in clarification.

Botanic Garden Forced To Euthanize Rose Bush That Pricked Child
GLENCOE, IL — Acknowledging that the decision was distressing but ultimately the correct course of action, Chicago Botanic Garden officials confirmed Friday that they were forced to euthanize a rose bush after it pricked a child. "This morning, we made the difficult choice to end the life of our 15-year-old rose bush after it injured one of our guests," said Botanic Garden spokesperson Bill Werner, who noted that the woody perennial was not considered aggressive, but it had pricked caretakers at least twice in the past. "Although the plant was only protecting itself after a child bypassed a one-foot-tall guard rope and entered the enclosure, we had to take measures to protect the boy from further injury. A groundskeeper humanely sprayed the rose bush with Roundup, and that area of the garden will remain closed while we dig up its roots." Werner added that the Chicago Botanic Garden would continue its rose breeding operation despite calls to halt the program.

NOVI, MI — Vowing to give such an important request the respect it deserves, local Chili's server Melissa Cortez told reporters Friday that she was unbelievably touched to be asked by a customer for her opinion on whether the enchiladas or burger was a better choice. "Oh, wow, for a lowly waiter like me to be asked by a patron whether I prefer the Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas or the Southern Smokehouse Burger is just an incredible honor," said a visibly emotional Cortez, adding that she never thought the day would come when a customer would not only look to her for guidance but also value her views on the tastiness of different menu items. "It's such a huge compliment to have my food preferences given equal weight to those of the people I serve. I'm truly moved by it. I'll make sure to think carefully about this because whatever I say could sway their entire order, and that is a huge responsibility that should not be taken lightly." Cortez added that after much deliberation, she informed the table that, "to be honest, you can't go wrong with either."

New Restaurant Specializes In Trendy Japanese-Japanese Fusion Cuisine
SAN FRANCISCO — Declaring that his vaunted culinary insights most often come from the simple practice of combining diverse food cultures across the globe, avant-cuisine innovator and star restaurateur Victor Tobias announced Wednesday the opening of Teriyaki-San, his new restaurant specializing in cutting-edge Japanese-Japanese fusion cuisine. "It's astounding what innovative, taste-forward, and yet truly simple dishes you can create when you take traditional Japanese food and interweave it with the classic textures of Japan. Think about the voluptuousness of sushi, but complemented by traditional Japanese flavorways such as earthy sesame seeds and the mineral heat of wasabi," said Tobias, whose inspiration for the radical gustative intertwining came from a six-month stint learning the ins and outs of traditional Japanese cuisine at a sushi restaurant in Tokyo's ultra-formal Akasaka district, followed a few months later by a trip to Tokyo's frenetic Ginza district to refine his techniques at a traditional yakitori. "You'd think the flavors of these two distinct places would compete on the palate, but I was stunned to discover they harmonize perfectly on the tongue, almost as if meant for one another. We're even experimenting with wild pairings of traditional Japanese foods, such as pork-belly ramen, with traditional Japanese saké. My feeling is, when you bring the food of different places together, you bring different people together." Reservations at Teriyaki-San are currently booked through the next 14 months.

Grocery Store Bar Actually Has Great Little Happy Hour, Reports Man With A Serious Problem
CHICAGO — Elated with his discovery of an establishment that fits seamlessly into both his daily routine and his self-destructive lifestyle, local grocery shopper Alan Cordova, who has a serious and debilitating problem, announced Monday that the bar at his local grocery store actually has a great little happy hour. "You'd be surprised, but they actually have a pretty good selection of craft beer on draft, and the wines by the glass are only four or five bucks. Sometimes, I'll even go and hang out there when I don't need groceries," Cordova said of his local Mariano's Fresh Market, where he has spent an average of $235 a week for the past month and from which he has brought home a large bottle of Tums, eight cans of Progresso Chicken and Sausage Gumbo, and a 24-pack of toilet paper. "The happy hour only lasts from 3-6 p.m., but if you stay later, they stretch the prices another half an hour or so. Some people even grab wine to sip while they shop, but I like to just sit there and chat with the bartenders, who are decent folks and will wait for your Uber with you after closing. There's even sometimes a guy who plays piano nearby, which is nice because it helps drown out the shoppers, but if you go on weekday afternoons like me, it's usually pretty quiet anyway." Management at Mariano's declined to comment at length, citing their legal responsibility not to discuss ongoing public intoxication lawsuits, but did say they hoped that Cordova was getting the help he needs.

I Believe My Experience Working On Films Such As 'Seven,' 'Ocean's Eleven,' and 'World War Z' Would Make Me A Valuable Asset To Your Next Action Movie
To become box office hits, today's motion pictures require dedicated, hardworking actors with the talent and know-how required to execute a quality performance on screen. While I know you have many good candidates to choose from when casting your production, I believe my experience working on films such as Seven, Ocean's Eleven, and World War Z would make me an excellent addition to your next action feature. With my background and skills, I believe I am a natural fit for a role in your movie. I am a dynamic, motivated worker with a wide-ranging skill set and 30 years of screen-acting experience. I am equally at home whether participating in a fast-paced action sequence, engaging in rapid-fire dialogue, creating chemistry with a potential love interest, or just brooding silently in order to build tension for the next action-filled scene. I have also learned how to perform well under pressure, especially when confronting my primary antagonist during the movie's climax. Whether you are producing a gritty, hard-R crime film or a family-friendly action-adventure franchise, I am confident I would tackle the challenge with the same effort and enthusiasm I've shown in the past as both a cop on the trail of a serial killer and a hero who must race against time to save the world from a deadly threat. During my career, I have excelled in many different work environments, from the American West to the steppes of Tibet to the bleak post-apocalyptic future. I am a self-starter capable of working alone, something I did in The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button as a man whose backward aging left him isolated. But I'm also passionate about collaborating with others, and in the Ocean's trilogy I worked as part of a team that executed high-profile heists. I have extensive leadership experience as well, having headed up the guerrilla unit tasked with killing Nazis in Inglourious Basterds. In addition to being highly proficient at running across rooftops, putting on accents, firing guns while rolling or jumping, memorizing lines, and falling off of high objects onto lower ones, I am also detail-oriented and able to think outside the box. I am mainly interested in playing a lead role in your movie, but I would be open to accepting a supporting part, and feel I would be integral to your film no matter how I was ultimately cast. As to location, I am very flexible. I would prefer to work within the greater Los Angeles area; however, if you are able to make arrangements for transportation, I would be willing to travel as far as London or Argentina. I am also more than willing to executive-produce, if necessary. Although I'm proud of all the projects I've been involved with, I believe my experience working on Ocean's Thirteen best sums up my professional strengths. Not only did it require balancing humor with action, it also presented me with the challenge of having to deliver a new, fresh performance while reprising a well-established role. In the end, my castmates and I not only met the expectations placed on us, but actually exceeded them. I was even recognized for my work with a People's Choice Award. In sum, I believe my skills and talents make me uniquely qualified to appear in your movie, and I hope you will seriously consider me when casting. If you require any information beyond what can be found in my attached résumé, please contact my references George Clooney and David Fincher. Brad Pitt

Man Feeling Pressure To Give Mom Grandchildren While She Still Around To Raise Them
ABINGTON, PA — Experiencing an urgent need to extend his bloodline, prospective father Mark Griffin said Thursday that he felt pressured to give his mother grandchildren while she was still around to care for them on his behalf. "Sad to say, Mom's getting older, and if I wait any longer to have kids, she may not be physically able to feed them, clothe them, play with them, and discipline them when I just don't feel like it," said 29-year-old Griffin, acknowledging that his mother had been dropping subtle hints that she'd like grandchildren, presumably in order to raise them in his stead. "Someday, Mom's not going to be around to take my kids to preschool each morning, so I feel a strong sense of obligation to her — she deserves to watch her grandchildren grow up, ideally while driving them to their doctor's appointments, teaching them the alphabet, and making them chicken nuggets while I pursue my interests." Griffin said he has "felt the clock ticking" ever since his mother revealed that by his age, she had already given birth to his two older siblings and had begun dropping them off at their grandmother's house for weeks at a time.

Man Has Absolutely No Clue How Old Anyone He Knows Is
LEAVENWORTH, WA — After he was unable to come up with a precise age for any of the dozens of people in his life, sources confirmed Monday that local man Edward Warriner has absolutely no clue how old anyone he knows is. "My dad's probably in his late 50s, so that means my mom has to be somewhere around there, too, but I'm not totally sure," said Warriner, adding that he was pretty confident that all of his friends were 28 or 29, just like him, but quickly admitted that he had nothing to base that on. "I think my niece is in middle school — or, come to think of it, maybe it's high school — she's definitely a teen or a pre-teen. Oh! My grandpa just had a birthday, and it was his 85th — no, 95th? That can't be right." Warriner added that he wasn't sure how old any of his coworkers were either and, now that he thought about it, he realized that he didn't know a single one of their names.

Home Inspector Warns That House Lacks Banister You Can Slide All The Way Down
ATHENS, GA — Saying he would personally be extremely wary of investing in a property with such a fundamental structural flaw, home inspector Samuel Finch warned local couple Irene and Matthew Gilman today that the house they were considering purchasing lacked a banister you can slide all the way down. "I hate to have such bad news to report, but it's best you folks know now that the front staircase here does not have a railing you can sit on and zoom all the way down from top to bottom — it's in pretty bad shape," said Finch, adding that moving into a home with a banister that is smooth and wide enough to ensure a fast and stable ride would be particularly important if the couple was planning to start a family. "As you can see, the current railing is far too thin and angular to allow for a fun slide down. If you do buy this property, the banister is going to need around $1,500 worth of work, and more if you want a large, round post that stops you once you've gotten to the bottom. I would seriously reconsider moving forward with this deal if I were you." Finch added that he would be happy to come back later if the couple ended up opting to renovate to ensure the banister was functioning correctly.

Hamburger Creeped Out By Eerie Soy Facsimile Of Itself On Grill
HARRISBURG, PA — Growing increasingly unnerved by the odd yet familiar patty, a hamburger on local man Bryan Greene's backyard grill was reportedly creeped out Monday by its eerie soy facsimile cooking nearby on the grate. "My God...we're so different, and still. ..so alike," uttered the meat slab to its double, whose round shape and meat-like consistency resembled its own but whose bizarre, tan exterior sent the most frigid of shivers through its ground-beef body. "We are so similar, our four-minute cooking time, are we not brothers? But what, then, of your unnaturally circular shape? Or the peculiar plastic wrap from which you came? And you had sear marks before ever being set upon the grill. Lord in heaven, what are you?" At press time, the burger froze in horror as it watched the vegetable-based product fail to bleed when it was placed on a bun and cut in half.

Whoa, Classmate Got Totally Hideous Over Summer Vacation
SANTA MARIA, CA — Completely floored by his new appearance, sources at Pioneer Valley High School confirmed Monday that, whoa, their classmate Jeremy Lucas got totally hideous over the summer vacation. "Holy shit, Jeremy got super vile over the summer," said Kimberly Stockton, 16, adding that she never really noticed Lucas before he became all gangly and grew body hair in all the wrong places, but now she could hardly stand to look away from his acne-covered face and greasy hair. "He's really been turning heads with his noxious body odor, constantly cracking voice, and massive Adam's apple. It's hard to believe this guy with all of the wrong facial and bodily proportions is the same Jeremy we've known this whole time." Stockton later added that she just knew everyone would clamor to be the first one to ask Lucas out as a joke.

Man Insists Facebook Friend Actually Reads 'Why Palestinians Are Sub-Human' Article Before Commenting On It
DALLAS, TX — Describing his acquaintance's backlash as intellectually dishonest, local man Gabe Weaver insisted Wednesday that his Facebook friend Matt Nathans reads the article he shared titled "Why Palestinians Are Sub-Human" before commenting on it. "Why don't you actually examine the author's carefully laid out arguments about Palestinians being worthless, scum-of-the-Earth feral animals whose deaths shouldn't be mourned before weighing in?" said Weaver, adding that Nathans simply made a knee-jerk reaction by labeling the piece as "wrong" and deliberately failed to engage with the blogger's reasons for why Israeli soldiers are justified in killing whichever unarmed protesters, nurses, and civilians of the ethnonational group they see fit. "Don't just go jumping in with unsupported opinions about how the Palestinian people don't deserve to be displaced, brutalized, and slaughtered. Read his rationale for why the Palestinian people are bloodthirsty savages who merit the abuse, humiliation, and other civil rights violations they experience at Israeli checkpoints, and then talk to me." At press time, Weaver was commenting on an opinion piece Nathans posted called "The Palestinian Tragedy" before reading it.

Study: 74% Of Home Contractors End Up Accidentally Walling Themselves In During Housing Construction
WASHINGTON — A new study commissioned by the National Association of Home Builders revealed Friday that 74 percent of home contractors end up accidentally walling themselves in when constructing or renovating a residence. "A review of home construction projects since 1995 shows that in roughly three of every four cases, workers inadvertently erected drywall or laid bricks and mortar around their bodies, trapping themselves inside the barrier where they remained until someone heard their desperate cries for help," said lead researcher Mark Vander, adding that, on average, there is a minimum of three contractors stuck inside any given newly constructed home. "During the building phase, many workers accidentally put the last piece of Sheetrock into place before realizing that they've made a huge mistake and didn't provide themselves with a way out. Without any doorways or other exits, the contractors roam inside the walls frantically searching for an escape, sometimes for up to several weeks or months." The study also found that entire construction crews are often trapped on the top floors of skyscrapers because they forgot to build stairs.

Apartment Completely Flooded With Disgusting Sunlight
CHICAGO — Expressing revulsion while surveying the sudden deluge of brightness, local sales clerk Adam Grant told reporters Tuesday that his apartment was completely flooded with disgusting sunlight. "Ugh, it just started pouring in through the windows and now it's everywhere," said Grant, who recoiled as every square inch of his 800-square-foot studio apartment became covered in stomach-churning sunshine. "It's so gross. And it keeps coming in. I don't know what to do because it doesn't look like this weather is going to let up anytime soon." At press time, Grant was reportedly on the phone with his landlord asking how soon someone could come out and install new window blinds.

It Pretty Obvious What Friend Will Look Like Old
LAFAYETTE, LA — Noting that their close friend's current musculoskeletal structure already provided ample evidence as to where and when certain wrinkles would appear later in life, eyewitnesses to the face of local woman Zoe Campbell, 31, confirmed Wednesday that it was pretty obvious what Campbell would look like old. "She already has pretty pronounced laugh lines, so it's not hard to think of those getting a little deeper as her cheeks soften and start to droop," remarked Campbell's close friend Helen Lepe, explaining that it was becoming increasingly easy to picture the skin on her 31-year-old friend's now-youthful face as translucent, powdery, finely veined like blue cheese, and sprinkled with liver spots. "When she smiles, you can just picture her cracking the same huge, gummy grin 40 or 50 years from now, laughing somewhat too loud due to deteriorating hearing, surrounded by a cloud of sweet floral perfume. Just swap out her hair for some bluish cotton-candy fluff, throw a pair of coke-bottle glasses on her, and you're there. She just has one of those faces." Lepe added that, if imagined just a tad hoarser and pitched up half an octave or so, you could also totally tell exactly how Campbell's voice would sound like old.

'We Must Protect The Pure Aryan Bloodline,' Says Child After 9 Minutes Of Unsupervised Facebook Access
PEABODY, MA — Having discovered the social media website open on his father's unattended laptop, local 6-year-old Oliver Sherman stated "We must protect the pure Aryan bloodline" Friday after nine minutes of Facebook access without supervision. "There's a white genocide going on in this country, and no one wants you to know about it," the kindergartener reportedly announced to his parents unprompted after clicking through a grand total of five links on an open Facebook browser tab before going on to convey his newly formed belief that a tide of Mexican rapists and inferior races was flooding into the country to subvert the proud lineage of the Caucuses through miscegenation and deceit. "I'm not saying Hitler got it all right, but I know what I know, goddammit, and if we keep falling for the false-flag operations of the international Jewry like September 11, the proud white race as we know it is doomed." At press time, Sherman had donned a makeshift Grand Dragon's hood crafted from his Paw Patrol bed sheet and was heading toward the front door after watching a Facebook Live video for seven additional seconds.

Report: Dad Wants To Show You Where Fuse Box Is
YOUR LOCATION — Noting that it's important to be prepared in case of emergencies but it's also a good thing to know in general, your dad announced today that he wants to show you where the fuse box is. "If something goes wrong and the lights go off, you're going to want to know how to get to this," your father reportedly said while leading you down the basement stairs, before opening the gray metal panel on the wall and pointing out each of the 12 individual electrical switches. "This one goes to the washer-dryer, and these go to the kitchen. If you blow a fuse somewhere and something stops working, you've got to find the correct one and push it over to 'off,' and then flip it back on again. This is the main power breaker; don't touch that one." At press time, your dad added that as long as we're at it, he might as well teach you how to relight the pilot light on the furnace, too.

Pet Gerbil Has Been Absolutely Crushing It Lately
HAGERSTOWN, MD — Acknowledging the rodent's hot streak over the past few weeks, local man Jackson Ramos confirmed Wednesday that his pet gerbil named Butter has been absolutely crushing it lately. "Rolling around in the clear ball, nibbling pellets, running on his wheel — God, the guy's just been knocking it out of the fucking park recently," Ramos said of the rodent, who had reportedly been "bringing its A-game" when it came to climbing the walls of its habitat, playing in a toilet paper roll, and standing up on hind legs to sip from its water bottle. "Up the tube, down the tube, the dude's killing it. Just the other day, I couldn't find him and all of a sudden he bursts out of this pile of wood chips. Then he crawled up my arm and just started nipping at my ear. This motherfucker blows our gecko out of the goddamn water." At press time, sources confirmed that Butter's magical streak had sadly been broken after an inflated ego had led the gerbil to mess around on the window ledge, fall two stories, and die.

LOS ANGELES — Studio executives at 20th Century Fox announced that production will begin next month on a big-budget, all-star remake of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, the blockbuster action film of 2005 starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. "We're always looking for ideas, and moviegoers really responded to Mr. & Mrs. Smith," said Fox vice president of development Mtumne Ngumwebaum. "Buckle up, action fans! This time we're going to do it bigger and better, with twice the budget and even hotter stars." Said film critic Harry Knowles: "You shouldn't touch a classic like Mr. & Mrs. Smith, but if you bring Eli Roth in as director, count me in!"

Local History Museum Really Digging Deep To Fill 2 15-By-20-Foot Rooms
HOPKINTON, NH — After viewing several topographical maps, an old wagon wheel, and a few rusting farm implements, visitors to Hopkinton's local history museum confirmed Monday that the curators had clearly dug deep to fill the two 15-by-20-foot rooms at their disposal. "The first room had photos of the town's past and a handful of framed newspaper clippings by the entrance, but the next display case was basically just full of old railroad spikes," said Hopkinton resident Clara Bouchard, who spent less than a minute examining a 1948 photograph of the town's former train depot before concluding the structure, which now houses a café and yarn store, looks more or less the same today as it did then. "In the second room, they had all these pictures local kids had drawn of the town. Which is nice, I guess, but it's not exactly history, is it? And there's a whole exhibit that, as far as I can tell, is just about the board members of the local historical society." Museum visitors were heartened to discover the wall nearest the exit was occupied by a trio of well-stocked vending machines.

10-Year-Old First Responders Rush To Bike Crash Scene To Check Out Tyler's Fucked-Up Leg
NAZARETH, PA — Sprinting down driveways and cutting through bushes to lock down the situation as quickly as possible, a group of 10-year-old first responders rushed to the stone-path scene of a single-vehicle BMX bike crash Wednesday to check out Tyler's totally fucked-up leg. "Quick, guys! Call Trevor, get Brian, too — we only have a few minutes here and they have got to see this shit!" said local fifth-grader Josh Osborn, directing his emergency response team to take crucial photos while simultaneously trying to get Tyler to relax and stop screaming so as not to attract adult attention. "This is what we train for, what we discuss for entire lunch hours. Sometimes, you only have minutes to see if the bone is, like, sticking out through his pants before someone comes and ruins it with a cast or something. Thank God Andrew was cool and came to get us the second he heard the crash, or we might not have been able to get here and gawk at his totally wrecked leg." At press time, Tyler Cantle, 10, whose injury was confirmed by the team as being "totally fucking nuts," was begging personnel not to tell his parents.

Funeral Attendees Getting Misty-Eyed During First Dance With Corpse
FRANKLIN, TN — Wiping away bittersweet tears as the lights dimmed and the lovely couple took the floor for the first time as widower and wife, attendees at the funeral of Martha Bowers got misty-eyed Thursday during the traditional first dance with the corpse. "You could just see the love in [Phillip Bowers'] eyes when he took her flaccid hand in his and guided her carefully to the dance floor, and everyone was amazed at how beautiful she looked in her burial dress," said longtime family friend Clara Adler, tearing up along with the couple's other friends and loved ones as the opening strains of Etta James' "At Last" filled the funeral parlor. "Just seeing her out there, swaying along with him, draped over his shoulder for the first time in this new stage of their, you know, their lives. ..it's so touching. You can see tears glistening in his eyes. This is the moment when he knows — it's forever." At press time, the funeral attendees had taken the floor and joined a conga line led by Mrs. Bower's earthly remains.

Man Sick And Tired Of Hearing Upstairs Neighbors Skirt Around Core Conflict Of Argument
NEW YORK — Finding himself unable to tolerate the continuing stubborn refusal to address the real issues at hand, apartment dweller Jordan Stills has declared himself "sick and tired" Wednesday of hearing his upstairs neighbors skirt around the core conflict of their long-running argument. "Christ! Stop screaming about the dishes and start screaming about how his mother is the problem!" Stills said to his ceiling, adding in a personal aside that he could barely hear his own thoughts over the petty bickering that masks the male partner's growing inability to be vulnerable around his romantic companion. "Shut up about whose job it is to clean up after guests leave and simply tell him he never listens to you, which makes you feel like he doesn't respect you, which, by the way, was a problem with your last boyfriend, making this a particularly sensitive issue for you! For fuck's sake, do I have to come up there to break this down for you?" At press time, Stills was observed pounding his ceiling with a broom handle and while angrily explaining how the central issue was that his neighbors had not felt close, truly close, to each other for weeks now.

Man With 20 Rifles Can't Remember If His Goal To Start Or Stop Violent Overthrow Of Government
BILLINGS, MO — Finding himself increasingly uncertain as to the purpose of his substantial cache of military-grade firearms, Billings resident Greg Carnes admitted Tuesday that he was unable to remember whether the 20 rifles he'd stockpiled were meant to aid in armed rebellion against the government or prevent the same. "I'm certain I got these guns for a patriotic purpose, and I know that I held strong feelings about that purpose at the time. I just wish I could remember exactly what it was," said Carnes, opening his gun safe to inspect enough assault rifles to either outfit or destroy a small platoon in the hopes that doing so might jog his memory as to exactly why he was willing to go out in a blaze of gunfire and glory. "I mean, when Obama was president, they were for sure so I could overthrow the government. But now, I feel like it might be to defend it? Man, I sure don't know. I got that 'Don't Tread On Me' flag on my truck and all, but I can't remember who that's talking about either." Carnes added that he was tentatively optimistic he could deduce the reason for his arms stockpile by flipping through his 6,000-page manifesto.

Woman Spends Entire Date Wondering If This The One She'll Mace
COLUMBUS, OH — Contemplating her romantic future while staring deep into the eyes of her dining companion, area woman Emily Hopkins reportedly spent the duration of her date Friday wondering if this would be the one she'll mace. "Call me silly, but like any woman on a first date, I can't help wondering if he might be the person I'll be forced to pull my pepper spray on," said Hopkins, who found she could barely concentrate on her dinner while watching for clues in her date's body language suggesting that he might ignore social cues and polite rejection and actually require the use of self-defense chemicals to fend off his advances. "As it is, I'm still not sure. I can definitely picture having to shove him away a little bit if he tries to force a kiss, but can I really imagine it becoming so serious that he gets down on one knee and screams and claws the capsaicin out of his eyes as I run away as fast as I can? They say you can sometimes tell if someone's macing material within the first 10 minutes of meeting them, but I just don't know if there's going to be any chemistry here." In related news, sources close to Hopkins' date report the young man remains undecided on whether or not Hopkins was someone he could see himself eventually assaulting.

Woman Attempts To Cram Few Years' Worth Of Body Positivity Into 20 Minutes Before Trying On Bathing Suits
EAU CLAIRE, WI — Speeding through affirmations about her looks, area woman Cara Waller attempted Tuesday to cram a few years' worth of body positivity into the 20 minutes she had before trying on bathing suits. "Listen up, girl, we don't have a lot of time here, but just remember every body is a beach body and your value as a person isn't tied to what size you wear," said Waller, 28, furiously scribbling "Beauty is a feeling" onto a Post-it note and sticking it to her bathroom mirror before taking a full 45 seconds to list things she liked about her appearance. "I should have been focusing on radical self-acceptance all along, but for now, I'm just going to repeat some body-positive mantras while I look for a new swimsuit. Happiness isn't size-specific! I'm more than just a number on a scale! I love me and that's all that matters! Hopefully that will tide me over until I'm done shopping." At press time, Waller had resigned herself to a black one-piece with a matching sarong.

Dad Ready To Forgive Dixie Chicks
GLASGOW, KY — Declaring that enough time has passed for everyone to get on with their lives, father of two Albert Wrinn told reporters Thursday that he was ready to forgive crossover-country trio the Dixie Chicks for remarks critical of former President George W. Bush that were made on the eve of the Iraq invasion. "They absolutely made a mistake, but it's time to acknowledge that and simply let bygones be bygones," said Wrinn, 62, who as recently as 2015 had been unable to so much as hear the band's name without launching into a tirade about how they were traitors to their country and to the state of Texas for telling the audience at a 2003 London concert that they were "ashamed" to be from the same state as Bush. "It's not healthy to hold a grudge, and, frankly, I'm surprised they let it go on for so long. Besides, the Dixie Chicks have some pretty good songs. It's time to move on." Wrinn also confirmed that he is in no way prepared to forgive singer Sinead O'Connor for ripping up a picture of Pope John Paul II during a 1992 episode of Saturday Night Live.

Senior Pretty Checked Out During Entire Final Year
PHOENIXVILLE, PA — Acknowledging that he is, after all, at a difficult age, sources at the Golden Living Center nursing home confirmed Monday that local senior Frank Gardner has been pretty checked out during his final year. "All he does lately is zone out and stare off blankly, so you can tell Frank wants to just finish up this stressful transitional stage of his life and get the hell out of this place," said attendant Laura Belkin, adding that because a lot of the 89-year-old's friends moved on last year, she can't blame Gardner for not wanting to hang around any longer than he has to. "There's really not much for him to do here anymore that will really matter or mean anything. Mentally, he's pretty much out of here already. Luckily for everyone, he has less than a month left." At press time, a panicked Gardner had the sudden realization that he was not in fact ready to leave, but was forced to do so anyway.

Man's Eyes Glaze Over Whenever Politician Starts Threatening To Plunge Him Into Serf-Like Subjugation
LANCASTER, PA — Saying it was a struggle to keep them open at all amidst all the tedium, local man Eric Meehan told reporters Thursday that his eyes always glaze over whenever a politician starts threatening to plunge him into serf-like subjugation. "God, every time they start talking about this boring stuff, I just completely zone out," Meehan said in reference to any of the bills circulating through Congress that would consign him to spending his days toiling away to generate profit for others with no chance of ever accumulating wealth of his own. "They just drone on and on about about how they're going to trap me in an endless cycle of wage labor and make sure I have no hope for prosperity in my lifetime. It's just, like, 'Enough already.' Christ, we get it." At press time, Meehan had begun spacing out mere moments into the announcement from GOP leaders that their proposed tax legislation had cleared another hurdle to passing.

Kid Putting Pencils Between Knuckles About To Fuck Someone Up
SEABROOK, NH — Warning that the real-life Wolverine was about to start some serious shit, third-grade sources reported Friday that Michael Handley, the kid on the other side of the playground putting pencils between his knuckles, was about to fuck someone up. "Man, I would not mess with that kid if I were you," reported classmate Jacob Frisch, explaining how Handley gathered three standard wooden pencils, sharpened them all the way, and began carefully fitting one between each of his fingers, demonstrating to all onlookers that he is seriously not fucking around about murking some poor chump. "Whoa, look at his eyes. I feel bad for anyone unlucky enough to be on the receiving end of that. A guy who would do that with pencils wouldn't think twice about taking someone's life." At press time, the entire class was hoping against hope that the teacher would avert catastrophe by telling Handley to cut it out.

New GOP Plan Offers Tax Breaks On All Contributions Tucked Into Congressmen's Suit Breast Pocket
WASHINGTON — In an effort to motivate Americans into giving more generously, a new GOP plan unveiled Tuesday would offer generous tax breaks on all contributions tucked into congressmen's suit breast pockets. "Under this new proposal, Americans would be afforded the ability to write off any donation that is coolly slipped into the breast pocket of a congressman's suit," said Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), explaining that if the plan passed, taxpayers would receive even greater deductions for larger wads slid into elected representative's front pocket with a wink and a nod. "This should hopefully provide much-needed incentive to Americans to palm off larger denominations while shaking their senators' or representatives' hands." McConnell went on to say that supplemental tax credits would also be provided on each luxury car belonging to the keys that just happen to appear on a congressman's desk.

LONDON — Missing out on a life of deep commitment from the only person who truly understands his heart, Prince Harry revealed Monday his engagement to a woman who will never love him the way 29-year-old Idaho resident and graphic designer Jennie Hoffman does. "We are delighted to announce the engagement and upcoming wedding of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle," said royal spokesperson Claire Hutton, of the American actress whose affection for the Prince is reportedly but a dim shadow of the passion and desire burning inside the Idaho State graduate and freelance artist behind the Boise Pizza House logo. "They are such a happy and loving couple [even though Meghan will never be as devoted or caring as Jennie, nor look into Harry's eyes and gaze into his soul] and we know their future is bright. We give them our blessing." The royal family also announced that the wedding date would be near the birth of what should have been the third child between Prince William and 37-year-old Rochester, NY woman Wendy Richmond.

Teacher Frustrated No One In Beginner Yoga Class Can Focus Chakras Into Energy Blast
LYNN, MA — Expressing dismay at how little progress her students had made, local yoga teacher Diane Holden was reportedly frustrated Tuesday that no one in her beginner vinyasa class could yet focus their chakras into a psychic energy blast. "C'mon, this is the fourth week of class — they should be going straight from downward dog into a full burst of channeled cosmic power, but they're not even close," said a visibly annoyed Holden, adding that none of the dozen students after eight weeks could even concentrate their chakras so that their body glows, much less project shockwaves of pure electricity from their hands and feet that flood the room with blinding luminance. "This class is pathetic. It's like they can't grasp the first thing about concentrating their third-eye energy in the hakini mudra pose to generate the swirling sublime ball of the energy blast. Boy, they've really got their work cut out for them if they want to have any hope of levitating by next week." Holden went on to say that the closest any of her students had come to practicing yoga successfully was when one united their mind, body, and soul well enough to make the lights briefly flicker.

Assistant Coach Finally Works Up Courage To Blow Whistle
OKLAHOMA CITY — Saying they were caught completely off guard by his sudden act of assertiveness, onlookers at a Duncan High School varsity football practice reported Wednesday that second-year assistant coach Bill Vining had finally worked up the courage to blow his whistle. "Everyone just froze and we thought we were in big trouble or something," sophomore cornerback Matt Baker told reporters, noting that the soft-spoken coach had rarely ever addressed more than a handful of players at once, let alone the entire team. "Even [head] coach [Charles] Pettis looked puzzled when he saw who blew the whistle. Once he had total silence and the undivided attention of every player, coach, and student on the field, he told us we had a big game this week and we needed to have a good practice today. It was really strange." Players and coaches later confirmed to reporters that Vining ended the practice by offering to walk the offense through a new play he had drawn up.

Dying Woman Sorry She Won't Get To See 37-Year-Old Son Grow Up
TULSA, OK — Saying she only wished she'd be around to look on with pride as he matured into an adult, dying woman Maureen McCarthy told reporters Monday that she was sorry she would never get to see her 37-year-old son grow up. "I was so looking forward to seeing the type of person Daniel will develop into once he leaves the house and ventures out into the world," said McCarthy, adding that it broke her heart to realize that she wouldn't be around to meet his first girlfriend or see him graduate from college. "Getting a driver's license, landing his first real job, voting in his first election — God, there are so many milestones I'm going to miss. If only I just had a few more years." At press time, McCarthy smiled as her darling son lounged on the couch reading comic books and decided to focus on whatever precious time was left.

DNC Files Lawsuit Alleging Nation Should Never, Ever Stop Focusing On 2016 Election
WASHINGTON — Demanding greater accountability for the race's outcome, the Democratic National Committee reportedly filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit Friday alleging that the nation should never, ever stop focusing on the 2016 presidential election. "Our lawsuit lays out, in no uncertain terms, that the nation should never under any circumstances move on from the 2016 election results," said DNC chairman Tom Perez, adding that the 66-page lawsuit filed in a New York federal court asserts that the American people must remain solely preoccupied with every little goddamn detail from the 2016 presidential race. "We're calling on WikiLeaks, Russia, and Trump campaign officials to join the Democratic Party in our efforts to spend the next several years prioritizing endless fucking discussions about potential election interference and what that means for democracy. We believe there was a deliberate effort to throw the race to Donald Trump, and that the American people have a right to publicly re-litigate Hillary Clinton's defeat and promote far-reaching conspiracy theories instead of concentrating on anything remotely politically constructive for the next few decades at least." At press time, DNC officials were calling for an emergency legal injunction to block the nation from learning absolutely anything from the 2016 election.

Cellmate Tired Of Suge Knight's Constant Stories Of '90s Rap Beefs
LOS ANGELES — Having heard the details so many times he could practically recite them by heart, Reggie Hall, Marion "Suge" Knight's cellmate at the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail, told reporters Thursday he was tired of the hip-hop mogul's incessant stories about long-forgotten '90s-era beefs. "I'll admit it was kind of interesting when he first got here, but now whenever he opens his mouth it's more bitching and moaning about Puffy or Eazy-E, or some story about how he had to pistol-whip some minor producer no one's ever heard of," said Hall, adding that sometimes he just wanted to go to sleep without getting a play-by-play of the 1995 Source Awards. "It's like, 'We get it, Suge.' You haven't forgiven Uncle Luke for that diss track 24 years ago, and, okay, Snoop's protégés were probably wrong to use the Death Row office without permission, but if I have to hear about it one more time while I'm taking a shit five feet away, I'm going to scream." The cellmate said it was especially frustrating that Knight never wants to hear about the family of four Hall murdered.

Report: Publicly Humiliating Unpopular Student Still Leading Cause Of Telekinetic Violence In U.S. High Schools
WASHINGTON — In a study confirming much of the existing research on the destructive and often deadly incidents, the Department of Education reported Thursday that public humiliation of unpopular students remains the leading cause of telekinetic violence in U.S. high schools. "Our data indicate that a friendless student is more likely to lash out with enhanced psychic abilities after being subjected to a cruel prank pulled at a school-wide event such as a dance, pep rally, or talent show," said Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, adding that such coordinated humiliations were directly linked to the psychokinetic violence of chairs flying across classrooms, screws slowly twisting loose from the structural supports of bleachers during school assemblies, and live wires detaching and electrocuting students on prom night. "In fact, telekinetic misfits duped into believing that they were popular for the sole purpose of embarrassing them in front of their crush were responsible for nearly every incident of gym doors slamming shut by themselves and locking students inside to meet their deaths." The study went on to say, however, that sustained bullying was at times also linked to violence dispensed by a possessed 1958 Plymouth Fury.

Most Shocking Revelations Of The Comey Memos
A series of memos written by former FBI director James Comey and released to Congress Thursday by the Justice Department provide more insight into his relationship with President Donald Trump, as well as offer information pertinent to the ongoing investigation into his administration's ties to Russia. The Onion presents the most shocking revelations from the Comey memos. The memos confirm the existence of compromising footage of Trump being sworn in as president of the United States of America. According to Comey, Hillary Clinton forgave him for the email scandal the day before the election. Trump was so concerned about Michael Flynn's poor instincts and lack of judgment that he made him national security advisor. The Trump administration canasta group never really got off the ground. Comey agrees with Jeff Sessions on more things than you're probably comfortable with. Even though the extensive use of footnotes suggests Comey was influenced by David Foster Wallace, his terse, masculine prose is all Hemingway. Trump appears to be actively and consciously choosing to do the things he does and say the things he says. After a lengthy discussion, Comey and Trump agreed that The Florida Project's climax was a stark departure from an otherwise nuanced portrayal of impoverished Americans. Comey has sent an itemized minute-by-minute breakdown of his day to the FBI every day since 1987. All of these people are incredibly paranoid and miserable.

Report: That Whole Side Of Family Just Like That
POCATELLO, ID — According to reports Tuesday from sources who said you'd get used to it eventually, that whole side of the family is just like that. "Oh, yeah, they're all like that. Always have been," said area father Bruce Mayer, noting that every one of them, from the oldest on down, was just a little off. "I mean, look at the parents — they're like that, so of course the kids are too. I know you only met one of them, but trust me, they're all pretty much cut from the same cloth." Mayer later clarified his remarks, acknowledging that Ron's sister Karen was actually kind of normal.

Jerry Jones Not Ruling Out Someday Trading Way Too Much For Johnny Manziel
IRVING, TX — After surprisingly passing on the opportunity to pick quarterback Johnny Manziel during last week's NFL Draft, Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones told reporters Thursday he has not ruled out eventually trading away far too much to acquire the former Texas A&M star. "Make no mistake, we may have passed on Johnny in the draft, but I'm still leaving the door open to impulsively trade away our future first- and second-round picks for him if we don't make the playoffs next season," said Jones, adding that firing head coach Jason Garrett in a moment of pure panic before buying out the remainder of Tony Romo's recent $108 million contract extension is not entirely off the table either. "Even tossing in a linchpin veteran player to sweeten the deal while bringing on a brand-new coach who will be permanently attached at the hip to Manziel is well within the realm of possibility for us. Johnny could very well be the starting quarterback of a completely gutted Dallas Cowboys team in the future." Jones also confirmed that he would be equally open to someday cutting Manziel after poor showings in his first four games as a Cowboy.

I'm Not Sure Why I Should Suffer For Something I Did 10 Years Ago And Would Do Again In A Heartbeat
Recently, several accusations have been made against me — eight women have come forward to claim I made inappropriate advances while working with them at CBS. I realize that my behavior may have resulted in some discomfort, but lost in the rush to judgment are important details about the context in which these interactions happened, and a lack of consideration over the damage these charges could do to me. It's important to remember that these events happened a long time ago, and times have changed. Workplace culture is different now, and since then I've grown older, wiser, and more determined to never alter my behavior in any way. Why should my career be destroyed over something I did over 10 years ago and would do again in a heartbeat? Most of these allegations are decades old. I understand many of these women were offended or upset by what transpired between us, but nothing I did was outside of what I thought was totally fine. My past actions should not be judged by society's standards from today, they should be judged by my standards from today. I will admit I made some mistakes, but must I lose everything over behavior that was considered completely normal at the time, and that I still deem completely acceptable? These events are in the past, present, and future, and that's where they should stay. I take these accusations seriously, and I am committed to making CBS a place where everyone feels comfortable, but this mob mentality is going to destroy lives. Should I lose my job over some bad meetings that happened over 10 years ago and will happen again at the drop of a hat? How far back do we go? Where do we draw the line? No man should have to live in fear that something they did a decade ago, or will do again this afternoon, could eventually come back to haunt them. Just think about the ramifications: my career and life in ruins just because of some mistakes I made countless times in the '80s and '90s, and will continue to do over and over again. That's an impossible standard to live up to. Do my detractors really want to live in a world where a man can have his reputation marred by nothing more than 30 years' worth of repeated actions that have become an ingrained part of his personality? Of course, I did some things wrong. Could I have been more understanding when women turned me down? Maybe. Should I have been much more careful and picked targets who wouldn't have given me such a hard time? Absolutely. But this was 15 or 20 years ago, and who back then didn't occasionally sexually terrorize an assistant? All I am asking is to be judged not for the person I was, but for the nearly identical person I am today. We all make mistakes constantly, deliberately, and without remorse, and then we refuse to grow from them. It's part of being human. A person can change. I am certainly never going to harass women with larger platforms or powerful media connections again. We shouldn't be going through every person's past, looking for every little string of assaults, just to tear them down. It's so easy to look backwards and criticize people based on what we know now, but at the time, nobody bothered to tell me I wasn't above the law. Hopefully, people realize that I deserve a second chance and will also deserve a third, fourth, eighth, and 22nd chance. We need to do better as a society. People occasionally do bad things, and they shouldn't be ostracized just because they will do them again as soon as they can. I've already paid the terrible price of being fairly upset for a few days. The things I did 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, and will do again next week do not define me. We need to learn to forgive and forget. Especially forget. If I show remorse and say, "I'm sorry," it should be enough for people to move on and let me continue doing these exact same things forever.

Jerry Jones Vows Cowboys Stadium Will Be Most Spectacular Ebola Quarantine Center Ever
DALLAS — Following news of a second confirmed case of Ebola in the city, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones assured local residents, as well as the nation at large, that AT&T Stadium is prepared to serve as the most spectacular Ebola quarantine center ever assembled. "Should a widespread outbreak occur, I am confident that Cowboys Stadium will be the most exciting and unforgettable triage unit in the history of modern medicine," said Jones, confirming that all contaminated clothing will be properly incinerated in a jaw-dropping, 25-minute on-field fireworks show each night, and that patients will also be treated to a star-studded performance from a number of hazmat-suit-clad pop sensations. "Each of our 80,000 beds will have perfect sight lines to our state-of-the-art video board broadcasting live updates on the outside world, and of course we'll also have several luxury wards available that will offer a full gourmet menu for those battling fatigue and blood loss. I look forward to showing the rest of the country that we do biohazard response just a little bit bigger down here in Texas." Sources confirmed that parking spaces will remain at their current average price of $120.

Man Unsure How To Expose Self To Woman He Likes Without Coming Off As A Creep
DAVENPORT, IA — Acknowledging that his purely romantic intentions could easily be misunderstood, potential suitor James Gerretson said Tuesday he was unsure how to display his penis to the woman he liked without coming off as a creep. "The beginning of any relationship is a delicate time, so instead of risking a clumsy or tasteless move, I'll wait until she smiles at me to take my penis out. And I won't just crack the whip, either, just tease it out bit by bit so as not to seem overbearing," said Gerretson, adding that if he messed up his chances by exposing himself in an uncool fashion, he'd regret it forever. "Guys probably show their dicks to gorgeous women like her all the time, so I've got to do better than just 'Bang! Penis!' The last thing I want is to be some weirdo who's part of the problem." Gerretson further remarked that he looked forward to the day when women felt empowered enough to take the initiative and expose their genitals to him.

Denny Hamlin's Spine Bone Done Busted
FONTANA, CA — Following a collision on the final lap at the Auto Club 400 last weekend, NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin has done busted his ol' spine bone, racing team medical staff confirmed Wednesday. "Denny came bouncin' off that inside wall hotter'n a goat's ass in a pepper patch an' got his spine bone smashed up sump'n awful," said team physician Logan McRae of Hamlin, who after plumb near snapping his standin' pole in two reportedly was done taken away in a big whirly-plane to a local hospital, where the fancy learnin' doctors figured his broke-up back axle was as useless as tits on a bull. "It's a powerful fracture, but we're fixin' to slap some spit on't and have our boy patched up lickety-split. He oughter be perambulatin' di-rectly, I reckon." Dr. McRae added that though Hamlin will eventually regain the mobility needed to resume his racing career, he may require the use of a steppin' stick for the rest of his days.

Woman All Geared Up To Complain About Work Sidelined By Friend With Marital Problems
FAIRBANKS, AK — Though she was all geared up to complain about work when she went out for coffee Tuesday, local woman Laura Roman was reportedly forced to table any discussion of her frustrations after being sidelined by a friend with marital problems. "Goddammit, I was ready to blow off some serious steam about how awful my job has been recently, but then, out of nowhere, Katie bursts into tears and says she's been having problems with Mark," said Roman, 38, observing that she couldn't possibly vent about the client who had yelled at her that morning, not after her friend began talking about how marriage counseling had been a bust and she wasn't sure things would work out. "As soon as she started telling me she's been unhappy in her relationship for a while now, I knew there was no way I'd find an opening to mention that I'm long overdue for a promotion. And when she said she thinks Mark might be cheating on her, I realized I wasn't even going to get to squeeze in an offhand remark about having to work late every night this week." Sources confirmed that the moment her friend excused herself to use the restroom, a pent-up Roman immediately sent out a half dozen texts to other friends complaining about how her boss has been "a total dick" lately.

Man Constantly Blaming His Problems On Fact That He's On Fire
SAN FRANCISCO — Saying his stubborn unwillingness to take responsibility for his life had done far more to distance him from friends and family than the extreme heat, sources confirmed Thursday that local man Bryce Galloway continues to insist that his problems stem from his entire body being engulfed in intense flames. "Yes, Bryce, we get it, you're on fire — We can see it, okay, you don't have to bring it up every five minutes. Did you ever think that maybe the fact that you can't hold down a stable relationship or get a decent job has less to do with you being on fire and more to do with your personality?" said longtime friend Tyler Bishop, who added he was "sick and tired" of Galloway insisting that burning alive was a bigger problem than his lack of organization or failure to plan for the future. "With Bryce, it's always, 'Oh, God, my flesh is melting!' or, 'My eyes are boiling and running down my face!' I mean, my student loans are crippling me, but I still find time to go to the gym, if you know what I'm saying." At press time, sources reported that Galloway had finally stopped complaining.

5-Year-Old Explorer Makes Contact With Life-Forms In Adjacent Booth
MERIDIAN, ID — Approaching the mysterious beings with a sense of curiosity and wonder, 5-year-old explorer Olivia Reynolds reportedly made contact Wednesday with two unknown life-forms in an adjacent booth at a local diner. According to witnesses, the harrowing journey began when the intrepid Reynolds stood up on her seat and peered over the padded vinyl backrest, greeting the small clan of exotic creatures by saying, "Hi." After making initial contact, Reynolds reportedly extended the gift of a broken crayon as a sort of peace offering between herself and the peculiar organisms as she probed deeper into their culture by asking, "Who are you?" and, "Do you like dinosaurs?" Once Reynolds had gained the trust of the entities, the pre-kindergartener then attempted to embed herself in their community by boldly climbing over the divider and using their table to prop herself up. At press time, Reynolds had retrieved a piece of bacon for later analysis and was fleeing back to the safety of her own kind.

Man Prowling At Airport Gate Ready To Pounce Like Jungle Cat At First Sign Of Boarding
SAN FRANCISCO — Slinking stealthily as he scanned the departure desk for any sudden movement, local man Aaron Smith reportedly prowled San Francisco International Airport's gate 33 Friday like a jungle cat ready to pounce at the first sign of a boarding announcement. Smith, whose pupils had fully dilated after witnessing the gate agent lean in toward her microphone, is said to have frozen in place, tightening the grip on his carry-on bag and tensing his entire body as if he were a jaguar ready to lunge at a marsh deer drinking from an Amazonian water hole. According to onlookers, Smith tracked the elderly travelers and passengers with disabilities during the pre-boarding process like an apex feline predator eyeing the weakest member of a herd to isolate and ambush, his gaze fixed and intense as attendants guided the group's wheelchairs down the jet bridge. At press time, after the gate agent announced that passengers in the first zone could begin to board, Smith reportedly pulled his ticket from his pocket with lightning-quick reflexes and charged forward to the front of the queue in a manner identical to that of a leopard bounding after a spooked warthog.

Pilot Informs Passengers They Will Be Rerouting To Avoid Scary Cloud That Looks Like Shark
TEMPE, AZ — Advising passengers on Flight 523 to Chicago to sit tight while the aircraft was rerouted, United Airlines pilot Thomas Langard informed his passengers Friday that they would be altering course to avoid a scary cloud that looked just like a big shark. "This is your captain speaking; it's my duty to inform you that we will be departing slightly from our charted route in order to avoid a terrifying cumulonimbus cloud that resembles a really big great white shark," said Langard over the intercom, apologizing for the 20-30 minutes the detour would add to their flight time but emphasizing that there was no other way to avoid the giant sky shark. "Ladies and gentlemen, I am scared — although meteorology out of Phoenix Tower tells me it's just a cloud, my professional experience tells me it looks exactly like a big, angry shark with sharp teeth, so on behalf of your flight crew I'm going to go ahead and veer eastward so we can keep our distance. People on the left side of the aircraft may want to lower their window shades to avoid getting spooked by the cloud shark or even looking it in the eyes and getting it angry, and we'll be sending our flight attendants to distribute blankets in case you want something to hide under." Federal air traffic control later reported that Langard returned the plane to its original course after prevailing high-altitude winds transformed the cloud into a playful and friendly dolphin.

Adorable 23-Year-Old Yelling About Economic Injustice Must Have Just Read Howard Zinn For First Time

"Aw, listen to him going on and on about robber barons and American imperialism — isn't he the cutest?" observer Amber Irving said of Kyle Green, the young man who was reportedly all in a huff about the Spanish-American War, putting a knowing smile on the face of everyone within earshot. "Oh my goodness! Now he's throwing a little fit about railroad strikes, of all things. He's really quoting chapter and verse, isn't he? And look how earnest the little guy is!" At press time, sources reported a visibly worked-up Green had taken to social media to reappraise the legacy of Christopher Columbus.

The plastic receptacle, which is filled nearly to the brim and rippling due to mild turbulence, is reportedly being extended across your expensive and relatively new laptop in the direction of the person seated next to you, who is currently nodding off and unaware his beverage has arrived. As the flight attendant leans in, dangling the juice above the computer containing work files and family photos you have not backed up anywhere else, witnesses are reporting that a passenger two seats behind you is trying to squeeze by both her and the beverage cart. Sources added that all of this is happening as the plane speeds at 500 miles per hour 40,000 feet above the earth. At press time, the person next to you was seen attempting to accept the drink and pass back a credit card with the same hand.

Dallas Cowboys Halftime Show Features Execution Of Texas Prisoner
ARLINGTON, TX — Marking the Cowboys' season opener against the Giants in traditional fashion, Dallas fans were reportedly treated to a thrilling halftime show Sunday night that featured the execution of a Texas state prisoner. "That was the best halftime show I've seen in years — there was this awesome light show with Toby Keith's 'American Ride' playing over the sound system while a priest administered the last rites," said 46-year-old Cowboys fan Alan Kierstead, adding that he especially enjoyed when Cowboys cheerleaders formed the shape of a skull around the stage and performed an elaborate dance routine before the convicted felon was injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital. "My favorite part was when he finally went limp and all those fireworks shot up from the top of the stadium. I just wish I were one of those lucky people on the field who got to watch it close-up." Delighted fans also told reporters that the halftime execution was far better than any other such event at Texas Stadium, noting that the view of the inmate's last breath was much better on the venue's state-of-the-art 72-foot-tall LED jumbotron.

English Teacher Already Armed With Deadly Weapon Called Shakespeare
CHAMBERSBURG, PA — As the national debate surrounding school shootings continues with President Trump recently suggesting educators carry guns in the classroom, high school English teacher Mary Bacher told reporters Thursday that she was already armed with a deadly weapon called Shakespeare. "There's nothing more lethal than the razor-sharp wit of the great Bard of Avon," said Bacher, noting that when it comes to defense, she is "locked and loaded" with the devastating free verse found in the 37 plays and 154 sonnets of the late 16th century English playwright and poet. "His works have brought the great to their knees, and even the most heavily armored of hearts cannot withstand the penetrating insight and incandescent passion of his mellifluous sonnets. To wield the power of one of the greatest minds in history, I don't need a concealed carry license — just access to his arsenal of high-caliber words." Bacher confirmed that if she were in an active shooter situation, she would merely quote Henry V's "St. Crispin's Day" speech aloud to her students to give them courage and instill confidence that the pen is truly mightier than the sword.

Girlfriend's Birthday Weekend A Nightmarish, Labyrinthian Journey Through Her Darkest, Most Depraved Desires
NEW YORK — Describing the 72-hour gauntlet of meals, gifts, surprises, and social events as "spine-chilling," exhausted local man Blake McNally told reporters Monday that his girlfriend's birthday weekend had been a nightmarish labyrinth through her darkest and most depraved desires. "God, I thought we were done after getting tapas with her roommates, walking along the river, and sharing an impromptu couple's massage, but little did I know that was only the beginning," said McNally, recalling that the following day was a harrowing and debauched odyssey of rock climbing, wine tasting, furniture browsing, and salsa dancing that culminated in two separate karaoke engagements. "Then her sick, twisted mind had us wake up early to visit the Natural History Museum, which morphed into cocktails on a rooftop bar, followed by a sudden urge to take a carriage ride through Central Park — all this, of course, being a prelude to the actual birthday dinner with her parents." At press time, McNally's girlfriend said she was looking forward to planning his birthday weekend, a wild, unhinged fantasia of pizza and Xbox.

Employees Annoyed At Having To Attend 3-Hour-Long Sexual Seduction Training
SPARKS, MD — Noting that the extensive program would significantly cut into their workday, employees at digital agency IMERQ were reportedly annoyed Thursday at having to attend a three-hour-long sexual seduction training. "I know sexual seduction is an important issue, but I hate having to reschedule client meetings just so I can hear some lawyer drone on about the proper technique for showering a team member with flowers and gifts before sweeping her off her feet," said graphics designer Tim Buckwell, echoing the sentiments of numerous coworkers who expressed frustration at being forced to sit through a lengthy Powerpoint presentation and Q&A session detailing the correct process for passionately wooing colleagues in and outside of the workplace. "I remember during the last one of these, they spent over half an hour just covering when it is and isn't erotic to gently caress a subordinate's neck while whispering sweet nothings into their ear. Honestly, a lot of this stuff is just basic common sense." At press time, several employees were reportedly excited to implement their new seduction tools such as flirtatious glances, pickup lines, and physical contact to entice a susceptible victim.

Maid Of Honor Specifically Selected For Ability To Take Emotional Beating
CHARLOTTE, NC — Calling the woman perfectly suited to bear the brunt of her pre-wedding psychosis, bride-to-be Emily Cervantes said on Thursday that she specifically picked her maid of honor Jessica Cross for her ability to take an emotional beating. "Jessica isn't even my very best friend, but she is by far the most able to endure my ever-changing whims, exasperatingly unclear directives, and, of course, tantrum after tantrum," said Cervantes, adding that no one else in her inner circle had the mental fortitude to withstand that level of trauma and still be able to plan the perfect bachelorette weekend. "It's going to get pretty dicey, and only someone like Jessica could wade through that kind of psychological shitstorm and not fall apart like a house of cards." Cervantes added that Cross was also ideal because the experience wouldn't leave her all that damaged if she had to go through this again in five years.

WARWICK, RI — Saying it wished it had touched down to rest its wings somewhere a bit less visible, a local bird told reporters Tuesday that it wouldn't have landed on a ledge had it known everyone would make it into a whole big thing. "God, if I'd realized all these people would lose their goddamn minds, I never would have done it," said the eastern bluebird, adding that there was no way it could preen its feathers in peace when it was being gawked at "like some kind of freak." "I can't just pretend people aren't pressing their faces against the window and staring at me. Seriously, what's the big deal? Like they've never seen a bluebird before?" At press time, the bluebird had discreetly perched on a tree limb high above the ground and reportedly could not believe how much attention a stupid cardinal on the ledge was getting.

ANN ARBOR, MI — Groaning upon spotting the image on his Facebook newsfeed, local man Peter Grant was reluctantly forced to agree with an absolutely moronic political cartoon Tuesday in which the Statue of Liberty was depicted hugging several immigrants. "Goddammit, I have to admit that this dumb as shit drawing actually represents what I believe," said an exasperated Grant, who muttered "for fuck's sake" upon realizing he fully concurred with a cartoon entitled "Shining Sanctuary City On A Hill." "I assume the point of this piece of shit is that the United States should welcome immigrants, which I'm totally on board with. But, Christ, just look at it. The immigrants have suitcases labeled 'Skills,' 'Work Ethic,' and 'Grit' on the side. This is so fucking infuriating." At press time, Grant could not help but write "thanks for sharing" under the dumbass cartoon in which a road behind the Statue of Liberty led toward the words "American Dream."

"I know sexual seduction is an important issue, but I hate having to reschedule client meetings just so I can hear some lawyer drone on about the proper technique for showering a team member with flowers and gifts before sweeping her off her feet," said graphics designer Tim Buckwell, echoing the sentiments of numerous coworkers who expressed frustration at being forced to sit through a lengthy Powerpoint presentation and Q&A session detailing the correct process for passionately wooing colleagues in and outside of the workplace. "I remember during the last one of these, they spent over half an hour just covering when it is and isn't erotic to gently caress a subordinate's neck while whispering sweet nothings into their ear. Honestly, a lot of this stuff is just basic common sense." At press time, several employees were reportedly excited to implement their new seduction tools such as flirtatious glances, pickup lines, and physical contact to entice a susceptible victim.

Unpatriotic Man Does Not Maintain Erection During National Anthem
PHILADELPHIA — Brazenly demonstrating his near-traitorous contempt for his country, unpatriotic man Douglas Harlow on Tuesday reportedly failed to maintain an erection for the duration of the National Anthem. "Sorry, but he doesn't deserve to call himself an American if he won't keep his hard-on going for the entire song," said nearby stadium attendee Rick Glasbergen, explaining that someone who truly loved the United States and everything it stands for would never let his penis go semi-soft while the "Star-Spangled Banner" played. "It's bad enough that some of these athletes are totally flaccid in protest, but now even the fans can't be bothered to stay sprung for two minutes? Well, I have red, white, and blue coursing through my willie, and if this guy doesn't like it, he can just find some other place where his limp-dicked America-bashing is welcome." Glasbergen went on to say that if the man couldn't even maintain his erection, there's no way he'd patriotically orgasm at the last triumphant note.

Gerbil Running Late Will Have To Eat Her Babies On The Go
HARRISBURG, PA — Realizing she was running well behind schedule, local gerbil Waffles told reporters Tuesday that she had no choice but to eat her newborn babies on the go. "There's just not enough time to devour them at home and get to my wheel by nine," said the 2-year-old mother of three as she hurriedly gathered her pink, hairless brood and scrambled out of the nest to commute through the plastic tube. "If I had just gotten up earlier, I could have sat down and enjoyed them. Instead, I'm going to have another rushed meal, and I'll probably have bits of my offspring all over my fur when I arrive." At press time, Waffles still had half a pup left to devour in a pile of wood shavings for lunch.

Stepson Absolutely Nailing Jeopardy Category About Third Reich
EDMOND, OK — Amazed at how quickly the boy had answered four consecutive questions, local man Kevin Gibson said Monday that his stepson was absolutely nailing the Jeopardy! category about the Third Reich. "Wow, Kyle just rattled off the name of the Nazi Party anthem like it was nothing," said a stunned Gibson, adding that the 17-year-old not only knew the exact date Lithuania surrendered Memel to Germany, but he also responded lightning-fast the very second Alex Trebek finished reading the clue. "The first question was kind of easy, but then there was one about some random concentration camp in Poland, and instantly he was just like, 'Oh, that's Majdanek.' Meanwhile, all three contestants just stood there like there was no way anyone was gonna know this." At press time, Gibson thought his stepson had finally guessed wrong, only for the show to issue a correction minutes later.

Local Woman Considers Telling Gynecologist Whole Truth
ST. LOUIS — Taking a moment to consider the possibility that having an honest conversation with her doctor may actually be beneficial, local woman Denise Bowers said Tuesday that she was thinking about telling her gynecologist the whole truth. "Maybe this time I'll just bite the bullet and let her know everything," said Bowers, who sat in the waiting room ahead of her appointment and quietly contemplated the prospect of openly detailing her symptoms to her gynecologist for the first time in her sexually active life. "On the other hand, she's a professional, so she'll probably figure it out herself, right? I mean, maybe I can strike a balance by answering truthfully any direct questions she asks but not volunteering any information on my own." At press time, Bowers was mentally calculating the precise amount of information she would have to divulge in order to obtain powerful prescription antibiotics.

Couple's Fucked-Up Presex Ritual Involves Tucking Both Kids Into Bed
SUN PRAIRIE, WI — According to shocked and disgusted sources, local couple Graham and Allison Finlay partake in a bizarre presex ritual where they tuck both of their kids into bed and then kiss them goodnight. The "nasty freaks" reportedly watch their 2- and 5-year-olds brush their teeth, sing them a little song, and pull the covers snugly over their bodies as a form of foreplay carried out prior to intercourse in their own bedroom. Accounts suggest that the Finlays are, in fact, so dedicated to this erotic practice that they perform it nightly and very likely "can't get their pervy rocks off without it." Given their deviant sexual proclivities, sources speculated that the couple probably liked to stay quiet during sex just so they could secretly listen in on their youngest through the baby monitor.

Area Man Stops Self After Eating 3 Advent Calendars
LUBBOCK, TX — Placing the remainder well out of sight where he wouldn't be tempted, local man Ben Hart told reporters Wednesday that he finally managed to stop himself after eating three advent calendars. "I said I'd only eat one, but these things are so addicting that I just started popping them in my mouth without thinking," said Hart, adding that while he felt a little sick after scarfing down the Lindt chocolates from two Santa's workshop advent calendars, he couldn't help but immediately move on to a calendar shaped like a Christmas tree. "Something about little chocolates behind little windows just makes me into some kind of animal. If I don't stop myself, I could easily eat a couple dozen of these things." At press time, a frenzied Hart had devoured the entire contents of a Nativity-themed advent calendar in under two minutes.

Perfect Girlfriend Blames Self For Everything
DALLAS — Confirming that the woman he has been dating since last year is "the whole package," local man Tim Gurtz told reporters Monday his absolutely perfect girlfriend, Sasha Klein, blames herself for everything. "We get along so well we hardly ever fight, but when we do, she immediately backs down, says it's all her fault, and then apologizes," said Gurtz, adding that he knew Klein was the perfect girl for him on their first date, when he was 40 minutes late to meet her at a restaurant and she blamed herself for having made the reservation too early. "Whenever I'm feeling upset or frustrated, she's always there to put her arms around me and tell me she's to blame for everything. She's just the best." At press time, sources reported that Klein had broken up with Gurtz after blaming herself for not being good enough for him.

Kid With Massive Head Probably Psychic
ST. CLOUD, MN — Saying there was no chance a cranium like that held an ordinary brain, sources told reporters Thursday that local boy Joshua Baker's massive head indicated he had psychic powers. "There's no way a kid with that humongous skull can't do all kinds of crazy shit with his mind," said neighbor Marcy Engel, adding she was nearly certain that the child could at any point enter her thoughts simply by concentrating so hard that the veins on his gigantic dome started pulsating. "Seriously, he could probably throw a car just by staring at it and lifting his chin or make your head explode just by putting his fingers up to the temples of that humongous thing." Engel went on to say she wouldn't be surprised if the kid learned to teleport or even time travel since it didn't seem like that enormous head of his would be done growing anytime soon.

I think I'm gonna be sick." At press time, the the already queasy article was beginning to feel claustrophobic after several ads began rolling out on top of it.

Veteran Told What Offends Him
WASHINGTON — In the wake of protests in which some players knelt during the national anthem prior to this week's NFL games, a U.S. Army veteran has been informed that the acts offended him. "This behavior spits in the face of everything you fought for," said friends, family members, co-workers, politicians, television pundits, newspaper columnists, and millions of social media users, notifying the 65-year-old who served two tours in the Vietnam War that the protests were a mockery of all the sacrifices he had made. "You didn't risk your life so that a bunch of millionaires could grandstand about some social issues. When these players refuse to rise for the anthem, they're trampling all over your legacy, so of course you'd be furious." Upon stating that the protests saddened him but that he had fought for their right to take place, the veteran was informed that, while his service was appreciated, he just wasn't getting it.

Condo Board Member Thinks Bylaw Cover-Up Might Go All The Way To Deb
PENSACOLA, FL — With everything becoming more and more clear the deeper he dug, local Oceanside Heights Condominium board member Carl Langford began to suspect Tuesday that a bylaw cover-up might go all the way to Deb. "Deb? This can't be possible, could it?" said a shaken Langford, adding that while he might have expected someone like Bruce or Monica to look the other way when a new tenant brought in a dog over the 20-pound limit, he never imagined that Deb herself could be implicated. "I guess Deb thought that no one would ever connect the dots. One of the junior board members would take the fall, and she'd walk away with her hands clean. And, who knows, with her kind of power, she just might." At press time, Langford was debating whether to confide in Tim, who, for all he knew, was in on it too.

Employees From Other Department Announce Plan To Ramble On About Fucking Nothing Right Next To Your Desk
SEATTLE — Declaring their intention to prevent you from getting any work done whatsoever, employees from another department announced plans Friday to ramble on about fucking nothing right next to your desk. "We intend to loiter directly adjacent to where you sit and loudly discuss some stupid bullshit while you're trying to get something accomplished," said the coworkers who, despite having their own desks in an entirely different section of your office, specifically chose the spot four feet away from your workspace to share idiotic observations about the most boring topics imaginable. "Furthermore, once it seems like our moronic exchange is about to come to its merciful end and allow you to finally concentrate on your work again, someone new will walk by, at which point we'll essentially repeat the excruciatingly pointless conversation we just had. We'll also make sure that at least one of us is loud enough to cut through the volume on your headphones, so there's absolutely no way you can fully disengage from our inane chitchat." The employees from another department went on to say that if you interrupt them with a remark that actually pertains to work, they intend to look at you like you're some kind of asshole and awkwardly distance themselves.

Man In Center Of Political Spectrum Under Impression He Less Obnoxious
MT. VERNON, OH — Loudly explaining to anyone within earshot that both the left and right were ruining the level of discourse in this country, Jesse Levin, a man firmly in the center of the political spectrum, is under the impression that he is less obnoxious than those with more partisan viewpoints, sources reported Friday. "We're never going to get anywhere in this country if you lunatics keep foaming at the mouth about some one-sided fantasyland," said Levin, 32, who despite characterizing those who do not stand precisely equidistant between two ideological extremes as "raving fanatics" and repeatedly interrupting people before they can fully explain their "nutjob" beliefs, reportedly seems to think he is, in fact, much more civil. "If you idiots stopped throwing temper tantrums every time some little thing doesn't pass your precious purity test and came back down to the real, complicated world with the rest of us, we'd all be a lot better off." At press time, Levin was butting in on a lively social media debate to tell two total strangers that they were "everything that's wrong with this country."

Parent Now Just Typing 4-Year-Old Child's Every Word Verbatim Throughout Day As Facebook Post
GRAND BLANC, MI — In updates that reportedly were becoming both increasingly frequent and less interesting with every new addition, local woman Kate Morris was now just typing her 4-year-old child's every word verbatim throughout the day as Facebook posts, sources said Thursday. "I'm hungry. Can I have a snack?" wrote Morris, who had already spent several hours of her afternoon directly transcribing her child's every passing thought and nonsensical whim exactly as she uttered them approximately every 8-14 seconds. "Can I have some apple juice now? No, milk! No, apple juice! Noooooooo! Not in that cup! I want my Spider-Man cup. Mommy, look at me now, I'm a ghost! Mommy look! Look Mommy!'" At press time, sources reported that Morris had spent the last half hour posting nothing but "Waaaaaaaaah! Waaaaaaaaah! Waaaaaaaaah!" as she struggled to put her daughter down for her midday nap.

According to sources, the American shorthair that has been listlessly raking deep claw marks into most of the couch's visible surface has been feeling a bit down recently. Reports confirm that, despite it usually being one of his favorite activities, the hours the cat spent tearing the fluff out of the cushions did nothing whatsoever to lift his spirits. Sources later reported that Harvey could barely even muster the energy to kick kitty litter all over the floor.

Old Friends From High School Meet Up Every Year To Say Names Of Former Classmates
GRANVILLE, OH — Convening at their hometown bar to grab a drink and catch up on things, a group of old high school friends reportedly met up on Thursday as per their yearly tradition of saying the names of their former classmates. "Hey, remember that guy Dave Getler?" asked 32-year-old Kim Blackburn to a group of nodding Granville High alumni, each of whom took their turn listing a series of mutual acquaintances from the specific four-year period in their lives. "How's Marcy Levesque doing? Anyone hear from her? Oh, who was Shane Cook and Trevor O'Malley's buddy who used to date Karen Hest? Tanner Smith? I remember he would always sit with Devon and Sean in algebra — okay, now 'Sean Houlihan' is a name I haven't heard in a million years." At press time, those friends who still lived near each other agreed that there was no reason to wait another year to get together and say the names of former classmates as a smaller group.

Plan To Be More Positive Off To Shitty Fucking Start
PITTSBURGH — Confirming that the change in outlook was already a massive pain in the ass, area woman Jen McKessy reported Thursday that her plan to be more positive was off to a shitty fucking start. "Well, I'm not even three days into giving optimism a shot, and it already sucks," said McKessy, adding that her plan to live in the moment and give people the benefit of the doubt was probably a hopelessly naïve idea to begin with and that a smarter, less awful person would have realized this from the very beginning. "I can't believe how quickly keeping things in perspective has gotten fucking unbearable. I mean, maybe I should feel proud that a fuck-up like me has even lasted 72 hours with a positive attitude, but there's no way I'm missing out on an opportunity to feel like shit." At press time McKessy's revised plan to complain to everyone she knows was off to an excellent start.

Local Man Thinking About Becoming Asshole
SCARSDALE, NY — Saying he had been considering the lifestyle change for a while now, local man Pete Halloran told reporters Friday that he was thinking about becoming an asshole. "I've been giving it some serious thought, and I've finally decided to take the plunge and start treating people like shit," said Halloran, 29, adding that he had several friends who became assholes, and it seemed to be working out for them. "I'm just going to see how it feels for now, no pressure. If it doesn't work out, I could always go back to acting like a decent person. But who knows? Maybe becoming an asshole is exactly what I need." At press time, Halloran had decided that becoming a total asshole was more challenging than he thought and had settled on just being kind of a dick for the time being.

Man Surveys Party For Next Group To Silently Stand In

"Let's see, which of these clusters of people do I want to linger in for the next half hour or so without saying a single word?" thought Weber, who sources said had grown bored with the stale conversation of the partygoers he was mutely hovering around. "Those people over by the refrigerator seem interesting. Maybe I'll wander over to grab a beer and then just sort of loiter around the periphery smiling and nodding my head every so often." At press time, no one in attendance had realized Weber left the party without saying goodbye to anyone.

Chipotle Mayo Doing All The Heavy Lifting In Sandwich
STERLING, CO — Saying the condiment was really putting the rest of the team on its back, area man Kevin Bentley confirmed Thursday that the chipotle mayo was doing all the heavy lifting in his sandwich. "Looks like this mayo is going to have to carry us across the finish line, because there's absolutely nothing else on this sandwich that has anything going for it," said Bentley, explaining that the spicy southwestern spread would, as usual, have to lead the charge since the roast turkey had zero to contribute, and the shredded lettuce was essentially dead weight. "The soggy tomato sure as hell isn't helping, and that single slice of swiss cheese might as well have not shown up today. The bread should be pitching in a lot more, but it's just sitting there like it knows the chipotle mayo is going to bail it out eventually — which it will, of course, just like always." At press time, realizing that even chipotle mayo couldn't prop up every sandwich on its own indefinitely, Bentley tried easing its burden by adding some crushed potato chips.

45-Year-Old Man Self-Conscious, Embarrassed By New, Unexpected Changes His Body Going Through
PAOLI, PA — Worried that people will be staring at him everywhere he went, 45-year-old Harold Brauner was reportedly self-conscious and embarrassed Wednesday by the sudden, unexpected changes his body was going through. "Oh my god, everyone at work is going to think I'm some sort of freak," said Brauner, who has reportedly felt ashamed and confused ever since turning 45 and beginning to notice himself suddenly filling out and growing hair in strange new places. "I'm sweating all the time, and I just feel so weird and gross. It's like I don't even recognize myself in the mirror anymore. Wearing loose shirts and sweatpants helps, but then I feel like it's obvious I'm hiding something. Ugh, why is this happening to me? I hate it! I hate it!" At press time, Brauner was taking some comfort in the fact his friends all seemed to be going through the same unsightly changes.

Complex Human Being Reduced To 'Gutter Guy' For Purposes Of To-Do List
NASHUA, NH — Taken aback by the cursory and near total diminishment of the living, breathing human being's multifaceted existence, sources confirmed Monday that a complex individual with rich and intensely personal dreams, ideas, and feelings had been reduced to "gutter guy" for the purposes of an area couple's to-do list. According to reports, everything from the man's wife, to his three beloved children, to his rich store of experiences, to the lifetime of memories that cause his beating heart to well with pride and regret and love, were rendered null and void in the cold and offhand stroke of a pen upon a sticky note. Indeed, sources stated that the man's 51 years of life — more than half a century of vivid and varied joys, heartaches, hopes, and fears — were unfeelingly whittled down to a single line item and tucked summarily and without remorse between the phrases "dry cleaning" and "groceries," as if this child born of stardust and circumstance, this being unique in the vast tapestry of cosmic time and space was but a one-dimensional, utilitarian tool and nothing more. At press time, with the pitiless writers' gutters now cleared of blockages and detritus, reports indicated that the phrase "call gutter guy" — the man's singular remaining facet of an individual identity — had been brusquely crossed out, taking with it the last faint echo of his luminous, vibrant, original essence from cosmological memory.

Woman Knows To Stay Away From Certain Parts Of Own Psyche At Night
URBANA, IL — Saying there are places it's best to avoid once the sun goes down, local woman Annabelle Fulton told reporters Friday that she knows to stay away from certain parts of her own psyche at night. "Just to be safe, I always make a point of steering clear of dark areas of my subconscious once it starts getting late," said Fulton, adding that while maybe nothing would happen, there was no point in chancing it. "If I'm going out for the evening, I stick to familiar thoughts I can trust, especially if I've been drinking. I definitely don't want to be wandering my mind aimlessly — one wrong turn can mean disaster." Fulton went on to say there were headspaces that were so unsettling, she keeps her distance from them even in broad daylight.

Mental Illness Determined Not To Let Stigma Of Area Man Define It
ASHEVILLE, NC — Saying it refused to be pigeonholed by widespread misconceptions about its condition, the mental illness of area man Greg Luger told reporters Tuesday that it was determined not to let the societal stigma associated with the 31-year-old define it. "There's always been a lot of shame associated with Greg," said Luger's depressive disorder, adding that until now, it had spent its entire life actively trying to hide the fact that it suffers from Greg and convincing itself that Greg was just a symptom of its own weakness. "When people find out that I'm struggling with Greg, they perceive me differently. And, look, I get it — if you don't suffer from Greg, it can be hard to understand something that does. But just because I have this one serious problem doesn't mean I want to be pitied or avoided. I was born with Greg, but I'm more than him. Much, much more." At press time, a boost in medication dosage was making Greg marginally easier to cope with.

Subconscious Can't Wait To Turn Offhand Remark From Boss Into Dream About Drowning Horse
BROOKLINE, MA — Chomping at the bit to twist the benign statement into an absolutely terrifying image, the subconscious of local man David Vanwell reportedly couldn't wait Monday to turn an offhand remark by his boss into a dream about a drowning horse. "Oh yeah, as soon as he falls asleep I'm going to manifest that frivolous comment from the earlier meeting into a horrifying visual of a stallion vainly flailing for its life as it slowly disappears underwater," said Vanwell's psyche, excitedly planning every detail of the panicked horse's descent to a watery grave that will somehow represent his supervisor's innocuous observation. "I've been waiting for the perfect excuse to drop a stallion in an above-ground swimming pool where it can sink down, down, down as if to the bottom of the ocean even though the pool itself is only six feet high, and now I have it. He's not going to know what hit him when the horse starts gurgling for help in his boss's voice." At press time, Vanwell's subconscious suddenly realized the drowning horse scenario could segue nicely into a scene of him being trapped inside a burning freight elevator that symbolized a casual text from his girlfriend.

Man Struggling To Pierce Orange Peel With Fingernail Under Impression He Could Kill If He Had To
CULLMAN, AL — Growing increasingly frustrated as he tried out different entry points on the fruit, local man Alex Overton struggled to pierce an orange peel with his fingernail Monday, all the while firmly under the impression that he could kill someone if he had to. "God, why won't this dang thing come off?" said Overton, who is confident that he could take the life of another human being if circumstances ever necessitated it. "I seriously have no idea how I'm supposed to eat this. Maybe I have to get a knife or something." At press time, Overton, who reportedly firmly believes that not only could he kill someone, but do so with his bare hands if given no other choice, was rushing to a sink to rinse out his eyes after being squirted by the orange's juice.

Parents Wish Weak-Willed Daughter Would Push Back Against Violin Lessons Just A Little
ARDMORE, PA — Expressing frustration at how she continues to remain silent and passively go along with whatever they say, the parents of Olivia Edison, 10, told reporters Wednesday they wish their weak-willed daughter would push back even just a little against the violin lessons they make her take. "Jeez, what's wrong with her? She hasn't said one thing about how she doesn't like the violin or how she hates having to practice her scales every day — what a little pushover," said Olivia's mother, Nicole Edison, 41, lamenting the fact that her cowardly daughter has yet to mutter an aggravated comment under her breath or roll her eyes at her parents even once despite a demanding schedule of weekend classes and out-of-town recitals that would elicit considerable resistance from a less gutless child. "We made her rehearse for two hours yesterday, and she just sat there taking it without even a sigh of annoyance. She needs to grow a goddamn backbone and ask to go play with her friends once in a while, for Christ's sake. It's pathetic." Olivia's mother then shook her head and added that if her daughter wasn't able to confront her parents now about the violin, she was never going to be brave enough to mount even a tepid protest when they eventually push her into majoring in pre-med.

Man Looks On Helplessly As Variants Of His Nickname Evolve And Multiply At Breakneck Speed
SEATTLE — Fearing the process was rapidly accelerating to the point at which it could no longer be contained, area man Brian Talbott reportedly looked on helplessly Tuesday as variants of his nickname evolved and multiplied at breakneck speed. According to witnesses, Talbott quickly lost control of the situation after the first major mutation from "Bri" resulted in a half-dozen new variations, including "B-Rye" and "Big B," all of which have gone on to propagate exponentially over the past several days and create their own entirely new strands of nicknames. Sources also said that Talbott could only watch in horror as every possible permutation of his name or initials was transformed further by the addition of rhyming words and suffixes like "-dog" and "-irino," resulting in Talbott being referred to repeatedly in meetings and in the office break room as "Bri Guy," "Talboss," and numerous other monikers. At press time, a new nickname, "El Tigre," appears to have emerged with characteristics completely independent from Talbott's original name and has itself already produced more than a dozen variations.

"Oh, God, how did I miss this shit?" said Quinlan, 29, who cringed upon realizing that his shirt was not long enough to cover up the garish decorative stitches that would be in full view for the rest of the day. "Christ, I can't just walk around with this thing on my pants — everyone can see it. Goddammit. How did I miss this at the store?" At press time, a relieved Quinlan had managed to salvage the pants by cutting off the flashy back pocket with a pair of scissors.

Man To Continue Slowly Drifting Into Middle Of Restaurant Until Host Redirects Him
SCITUATE, RI — Finding no one waiting to greet him upon entering the restaurant Monday afternoon, local man Adam Peretti reportedly planned to continue slowly drifting toward the middle of Sidney's Bistro until a host redirected him to a seat. "Someone's going to see me eventually and point me in the right direction," the 31-year-old reportedly thought to himself as he took several tentative steps into the dining area, scanning his surroundings for an employee who might come to his aid before shuffling several feet farther toward the center of the establishment. "If I spend enough time just wandering between the booths with a puzzled look on my face, someone's bound to come over to me, right? Man, I really hope somebody notices me soon — I've already passed two tables." Sources confirmed that Peretti reached the exact midpoint of the restaurant moments later, at which point, having yet to be approached by an employee, he reportedly opted to slowly turn around in a circle with his brow furrowed.

SALEM, OR — Assembling what he could from the nonsensical musings, local man Donnie Sulkin was forced to reverse-engineer his point Wednesday in the midst of an absentminded rant. "Okay, so let me just work back and try to figure out what I was talking about at the beginning of this," Sulkin thought as he hastily attempted to cobble together his original point from the few words and phrases he remembered saying while blathering. "If I could just rediscover what any of this was supposed to be about, I can salvage this jumbled diatribe into a semi-logical argument or at least one or two coherent sentences. I guess I'll have to keep talking and hopefully buy enough time to figure out the reason I'm doing so." At press time, Sulkin had realized he'd never recall why he'd begun speaking and was now just praying that people would start walking away.

Mom Really Gunning To Befriend Babysitter During Weekly 3-Minute Interactions
WILMINGTON, NC — Aggressively exploiting the short windows of time she spent with the high school junior, local mom Ally Brullard has been really gunning to befriend her babysitter during their weekly three-minute interactions, family sources reported this past Saturday. "Did you end up getting that dress you were looking at for winter formal, Sophie? It sounded gorgeous," the 45-year-old mother of two reportedly said, picking up the thread of the conversation at the precise point where the two had left off the week before and deftly using the brief 180-second period during which she pays the babysitter and then walks her to the door to rapidly glean as much information as possible about her schoolwork, field hockey team, and plans for next summer. "And do you still think Ethan might ask you to go? That boy would be crazy to miss out on going with you." Sources confirmed that Brullard then lit up immediately when the babysitter accepted her offer for a ride home and eagerly used the extended one-on-one time to probe her college choices in depth.

Pastor Talking To Non-Christian Who Just Lost Wife Can Smell Blood
ST. PAUL, MN — Casually striking up a conversation with a fellow passenger on a crosstown bus, local Presbyterian Pastor James Miller could suddenly smell blood in the water upon learning that the non-Christian man's wife had just passed away, sources said Tuesday. "Ooh, baby — we got a live one," Miller thought to himself, his ears perking up and his pupils dilating as the man informed the pastor that his wife of 20 years had recently died from pancreatic cancer and that he has felt lost and alone in the intervening weeks. "He's like a wounded animal. Okay, James, just nod compassionately and put your hand on his shoulder. Then, right when he says 'I don't know what to do' — bam! Move in for the kill." At press time, a visibly salivating Miller was telling the man about a support group for the bereaved that meets in the basement of his church every Wednesday.

Vacationing Uncle Posts Terse, Emotionless Facebook Update From Cruise Ship
NASSAU, BAHAMAS — Coming a full five days into the eight-day voyage, Russell family sources reported Monday that Uncle Neil had posted a terse, emotionless Facebook post from his cruise ship vacation, thus far the only dispatch from the week-long tropical getaway. Noting that the update failed to even mention the lavish buffets, sun-drenched decks, or any of the well-appointed cruise ship's other amenities, family members said that the post instead contained a photo of a nondescript cabin simply captioned "Our room." Sources added that the update neglected to refer to any beautiful island locales or points of historical interest at which the cruise ship had docked, and that the only indication that Uncle Neil's family had accompanied him on the cruise at all was an image of a blurry plate of food that inadvertently included what appeared to be Aunt Ellen's arm. At press time, no one had commented on the post, but it had been liked by two of Uncle Neil's coworkers.

Report: Nothing Wrong With A Good Old-Fashioned Ham And Cheese Sandwich
NEW YORK — Saying the reliable standby would never let you down, a new report released Monday concluded that there's nothing wrong with a good old-fashioned ham and cheese sandwich. "You could do a lot worse than a nice, dependable classic like this one," read the report in part, adding that while a ham and cheese sandwich was nothing fancy, it was a simple and satisfying lunch you could trust and even have for dinner if you wanted. "Two slices of bread. Some ham. Some cheese. No problems here." The reported concluded that whether you add a little mayo or some mustard, you really can't lose either way.

Nurse Reminds Elderly Man She's Just Down The Hall If He Starts To Die
DES PLAINES, IL — Assuring him that she'd be at his side in a jiffy, local nurse Wendy Kaufman reminded an elderly resident at the Briarwood Assisted Living Community that she was just down the hall if he started to die, sources reported Tuesday. "Remember, Mr. Donner, I'm right around the corner, so if you feel you're in the last few moments as an existing, sensate being, just press the button on your bed and I'll hurry on over," said Kaufman, adding that she or any other nurse on duty was happy to pop in day or night in case he felt himself slipping away forever into unending darkness. "I'm just a few doors down, and bringing you back from the edge of the eternal black abyss is my job. Really, it's no trouble for any of us to come in and stave off the icy cold hand of the Reaper, okay?" At press time, an increasingly perturbed Kaufman was making her third visit to the man's room in an hour.

2-Year-Old Unaware He's Basis For 6 Couples' Decisions Not To Have Kids
THOUSAND OAKS, CA — Oblivious to the unforgiving judgments being passed on him every single day, local 2-year-old Caleb Gibson is completely unaware that he is the sole basis for six couples' decisions not to have kids, sources said Friday. According to reports, the toddler has thus far failed to recognize that his temper tantrums and messy eating habits have motivated several of his mother's friends, as well as a couple who were eating near Gibson's family at a restaurant, to go their entire lives without ever raising children of their own. Gibson also reportedly remains wholly ignorant of the fact that his behavior this past Christmas, which included shrieking for 10 straight minutes after not getting a cookie, was directly responsible for his aunt and uncle's choice to never procreate, or that stories about staying up all night to take care of him are why one of his father's coworkers and her husband determined that they would be fine with just a dog. Sources also revealed that Gibson is unaware that he is the reason his own parents have decided not to have more children.

Man Keeping Running Total Of How Many People In Gym In Worse Shape Than Him
ENCINITAS, CA — Intently scanning the room for signs of fatigue or excessive perspiration, local gym member Brian O'Grady reportedly kept a tally Monday of how many people were in worse shape than him. "That guy's been on the seated bike for like a minute and he's already out of breath, and that old dude's doing like 30 pounds on the shoulder press machine — so, yeah, that's two," O'Grady thought to himself, leaping suddenly into double digits as he counted 15 people limply moving their arms and legs in a Zumba class. "And I bet I could easily outlast four of these people on the ellipticals, plus two, maybe three on the treadmills — oh, and definitely the guy who's been on the rower two minutes and could have a heart attack any time now." At press time, O'Grady had determined that a muscular woman doing numerous weighted pull-ups was a professional athlete of some sort and would not count against him.

3 Cups Of Coffee Confident They Can Take Man's Anxiety From Here
BOZEMAN, MT — Assuring reporters they could maintain the man's elevated levels of stress and get his mind racing uncontrollably, three cups of coffee stated Thursday morning they were confident they could take local resident Ryan Hubbard's anxiety from here. "Ryan's worries about an upcoming work presentation and his generalized unease about where he is in his life did a good job of setting us up this morning, but they can step aside because we've got this under control from here on out," said the combined 36 ounces of medium roast Colombian coffee, claiming it would be no problem at all to sustain Hubbard's debilitating self-consciousness around his coworkers and keep him continuously on edge without any assistance from his normal range of existential concerns. "Usually his relationship with his girlfriend and his discomfort in social situations does most of the heavy lifting, but with all our sugar and caffeine we'll have no problem shouldering his constant anxiousness and making sure he's a nervous wreck for the rest of the workday. We've totally got this. And we'll make him extra high-strung, too, for good measure." The three mugs of coffee added that while they were happy to keep the man unfocused and ill at ease for the next several hours, they were looking forward to calling it a day at 8 p.m. and turning over Hubbard's anxiety to a quarter of a bottle of bourbon.

Toddler Just Looking For Sensible Mid-Range Tricycle
HARLAN, KY — Stressing that he doesn't require anything fancy, local 3-year-old Jacob McCormick told reporters Friday that he is only looking to purchase a sensible mid-range tricycle. "All I need is a safe, reliable trike that can get me around the driveway without tipping over," said McCormick, adding that he didn't need bells and whistles like walkie-talkies or motorcycle-revving sound effects, and that he would be just fine with a comfortable seat, sturdy handlebars, and, if possible, a small compartment where he can store one or two action figures. "As long as it has three wheels and can get me from point A to point B on the sidewalk in front of our house, I'll be satisfied. I don't want any flashy colors either, so I'd be happy with a simple red or blue tricycle — not pink. Pink is for girls." At press time, while at Toys "R" Us with his parents, McCormick had decided to splurge on an all-black Lil Rider LED Space Traveler Trike for $79.99 and threw a tantrum when his mother told him he'd have to wait until his birthday a month from now.

'This Here Is Probably Our Bestselling Love Seat,' Says Man Who Would Have Been Powerful, Revered Warrior 4,000 Years Ago
RICHARDSON, TX — Upon observing a couple examining the furniture item with apparent interest, area man Aaron Eakins, who would have been a formidable and revered warrior had he lived 4,000 years ago, approached the pair and told them it was his bestselling love seat, sources said Thursday. Eakins, a sales associate at Cooper's Furniture Outlet for the past three years and someone whose height and strong build would have made him a fearsome adversary in a Bronze Age civilization, reportedly spoke to the couple for several minutes about the love seat's price, durability, and stain-resistant fabric. "This one's real popular," said Eakins, who four millennia ago would have led hundreds of fanatically loyal soldiers into battle, cutting down enemy after enemy with powerful swings of his ax. "Why don't you folks sit down and try it out?" "That's our microfiber blend — super easy to clean," added the man whose fabled strength and unmatched prowess in combat would have caused his very name to strike dread into the hearts of all who heard it. The love seat was reportedly part of a three-piece set, and Eakins pointed to the matching full sofa and lounge chair in the same way he might have once gestured across the vast forests and mountains of his expansive domain — lands through which he would have cut a broad swath of destruction, plundering every village in his path and demanding that the trembling inhabitants swear fealty to him on pain of death. The man whose body would have been lavishly adorned in amber, gold, and the bones of his vanquished foes then reportedly flipped through a ring of different-colored fabric swatches to show the couple how the love seat would look in white, off-white, beige, mocha, sage gray, and charcoal. "All our furniture comes with what we call our worry-free five-year warranty," said Eakins, whose exploits — from ruthlessly conquering every rival clan between his kingdom and the sea to single-handedly slaying 20 ferocious barbarians with a broken sword — would have been recounted over and over in saga and song that would preserve his legacy for all time. "It'll cover any defects in materials or craftsmanship." "That's real maple there, too," he added, instead of issuing, as he would have circa 2000 BC, an absolute decree while surrounded by pikes impaled with the severed heads of enemies. Sources said that when the couple asked about the availability of a particular fabric weave, Eakins stepped into a small break room to seek an answer from his assistant manager, apologizing for interrupting the lunch of the man who in centuries past he would have beaten with his gauntleted fist before plunging a dagger into his throat, taking his wife as a prize, and burning his village to the ground. "You get free delivery when you spend $1,500 or more," said Eakins, who once would have had a harem full of wives and concubines at his beck and call, guaranteeing his exalted name and bloodline would be carried on through a hundred generations, with his descendants heralding him as the founder of their proud lineage. "That includes our white-glove service, where we bring the furniture inside and set it up in a room of your choice." Reaching down to silence the holstered cell phone that hung at his side instead of a mighty blade that had tasted the blood of thousands, he added, "There's also a matching ottoman if you're interested." At press time, sources confirmed that instead of attending a bounteous feast held in his honor, with legions of followers roasting great beasts on spits, breaking open jars of wine, and rapturously chanting his name, Eakins was carefully pulling back the plastic film on a microwave lasagna.

Flu Can't Wait To Get The Fuck Out Of Area Man's Body
OLATHE, KS — Admitting that infecting the 32-year-old was a huge mistake, a sub-strain of the H3N2 Influenza A virus confirmed Thursday that it couldn't wait to get the fuck out of area man Peter Abbot's body. "I've only been in this shithole for a couple days, but I'm ready to cut and run from here as soon as fucking possible," said the flu, adding that it would rather be anywhere else on the goddamn planet than the run-down mess that Abbot calls a body. "I thought it looked really bad from the outside, but holy shit, I had no idea how nasty it would be once I got in. As soon as I get the chance, you better fucking believe I'm outta this dump." At press time, the flu reportedly expressed concerns it would never be able to leave after the man's condition worsened.

'Nothing Would Surprise Me At This Point,' Says Man Who Will Be Shocked By 8 Separate News Items Today
PROVIDENCE, RI — Just over a week into the administration of President Donald Trump, local man Alex Seidman, a 36-year-old who will be shocked eight separate times by today's news, told reporters Monday that at this point, nothing would surprise him. "Honestly, after everything that's gone down in the past 10 days, none of it really even fazes me," said the man who will be stunned on eight different occasions by news updates that will leave him wondering if the country's longstanding democratic institutions can withstand even half of Trump's first term in office. "Maybe a few months ago it would've upset me, even frightened me. But today, I'll click on The New York Times and it'll feel pretty [startling, with each piece of news more surreal and flabbergasting than the last, every article seemingly rewriting the rules of reality and slowly convincing me that there may no longer be any such thing as] normal." At press time, Seidman was now fully convinced that he would be spending at least the next four years in a state of continually heightening trauma, and thus far has not been proven wrong.

Woman Getting Stood Up On First Date Got All Drunk For Nothing
PORTLAND, OR — Saying she couldn't believe she went to all the effort, 26-year-old Kara Velasquez expressed anger and frustration Tuesday at having gotten completely drunk just to be stood up on a first date. "What the fuck — I spent the last hour getting plastered for this?" said Velasquez, slurring and partially spilling her wine onto the bar at the Cavern Pub, where she had arrived early with the express intent of getting highly intoxicated before her date arrived. "I am totally shitfaced now, and for what? To have this asshole Greg or Craig or Tim or whatever flake on me? Unbelievable!" Determined not to have the evening be a total waste, Velasquez told reporters she planned to text an ex-boyfriend, but at press time, was vomiting in an alleyway in the rain.

Cat Placed On 5 Minutes' Half-Assed Observation After Possibly Ingesting Plastic Thing
AUSTIN, TX — Immediately jumping into superficial action, local woman Catherine Nielson, 32, placed her cat, Reggie, on five minutes of half-assed observation Tuesday night after the gray tabby possibly ingested a small plastic thing from her apartment floor. "I saw him gnawing on some little white piece of plastic, so I'm just going to briefly and sporadically glance over at him for the next couple minutes," said Nielson while seated on her living room sofa, vowing to reporters that she would not let Reggie leave her peripheral vision until after the next commercial break. "I'll just make sure he's not making any weird noises or anything. Really, as long as I'm in the same room as him and occasionally remember to look over in his direction, that should probably be fine." At press time, Nielson's cat had quietly retreated to the corner to finish chewing on the piece of plastic.

Grandma Looking Like Absolute Shit Lately
VERO BEACH, FL — Unable to ignore the 86-year-old's dramatic physical decline since they last saw her, sources within the Delahunt family reported Monday that their grandmother Shirley is looking like absolute shit lately. "I realize she hasn't been fit and healthy in quite some time, but man oh man, Grandma's looking plain old rough these days," said Delahunt's granddaughter Michelle, adding that her grandmother seemed to have "really been put through the wringer" since they visited her over Christmas. "I don't know what happened to her these past few months, but this woman has taken a beating. Jesus Christ, tell me this is as bad as it's gonna get. I don't even know how it gets any worse." Family sources later confirmed that Grandpa looked pretty good.

"Oh baby, just look at that," the report read in part, adding that, hell yes, every ingredient in the sandwich was now soaked in the stuff. "Man oh man, it's flowing onto the plate now. So goddamn tasty." The report went on to say — sweet Jesus fucking yes — that a piece of crispy bacon had fallen out of the sandwich and could be dipped into the yolk.

Birthday Cards From Grandma Becoming More Religious
BEAVERTON, OR — Saying the escalation in biblical language and motifs was now unmistakable, Allen family sources confirmed Friday that their grandmother's birthday cards were becoming more and more religious. "At first they would just say 'God bless you on your birthday' or something, but now they include full-on Bible verses," said granddaughter Leah Allen, explaining that the trend began to accelerate when she received a card containing a preprinted psalm about the joy in God's salvation and had now culminated in cards with pictures of angels and crucifixes on the cover. "The cards used to be pretty generic with balloons and festive lettering and stuff, but now they're just off-white with the text written in overly fancy cursive. Some of them don't even say 'Happy Birthday' anymore." Allen later confirmed to reporters that the greater religiosity of her grandmother's birthday cards in no way corresponded with an increase in the gift she included.

Report: That Was Very Stupid Thing To Say
ITHACA, NY — According to a report released Thursday by experts who knew this would happen from the second you opened your mouth, that was a very stupid thing to say. It was a stupid, stupid thing to say, the report continued, and everyone heard you say it loud and clear. "Boy, that was really dumb," the report read in part, noting that ever since you said that thing, all anyone can think about is how you could have let something so moronic escape your lips. "Basically, you made a huge mistake by saying that out loud, and there's no way you'll ever live it down. Never." "Jesus Christ, what were you thinking?" the report added. Experts confirmed that everyone around you is currently thinking about what you said and using that information to rapidly reassess your worth as an individual. And though the conversation has now shifted to another topic, the report emphasized that people are still very much preoccupied by the stupid thing you said just a few moments ago. In addition, once you have left, everyone will reportedly engage in discussions about what you said and how dumb it was, and any respect they previously had for you will be totally lost. In fact, the report stressed that the social awkwardness you created with your single idiotic comment will definitely outlast the present conversation and will tarnish your future interactions with all who heard it. The experts also noted that not only will people always remember what you said, but they will think of it and nothing else every time they speak with you, see you, or merely hear your name. "Right about now, you are understandably wishing you could take back those ridiculous words," the report stated. "But you can't. Not now and not ever. And if you're hoping that maybe they slipped past even one or two people, we can confirm they didn't." "Nice going, genius," it continued. According to the report, those who heard your dimwitted statement will soon be mentioning it to their friends, family members, and coworkers who were not even present at the time you uttered it. Based on the report's projections, dozens of individuals will eventually hear about what you said, and in the event you encounter any one of these people, they will have already judged you mercilessly. "The best thing for you to do right now is to keep your stupid thoughts to yourself, if that's something you can even manage," the report recommended, adding that absolutely no one believes for a moment that your stupid remark was an aberration. "Don't try to fix things, dummy, because you can't. Just shut the fuck up for once and learn to live with what you've done." "There has always been something wrong with you, hasn't there?" it continued. "Deep down, you know it." The report concluded by suggesting you give up trying to learn from your mistakes, because you will inevitably just keep spouting stupid things like this again and again for the rest of your life. Reassuringly, however, the experts also determined that this may not be a problem for long, as everyone is now actively looking for excuses to avoid you.

Report: Store Out Of Good Kind
UTICA, NY — Unable to locate them on their usual shelf, local man George Rambart, 41, reported Thursday that the store was out of the good kind. "Aw man, they don't have any," said Rambart, adding that they had a bunch of the other ones, but those aren't as good as the kind he always gets, which are much better. "I guess a lot of people also like the kind I like. Maybe if I go to another place, they'll have them." At press time, Rambart was even more disappointed upon learning that not only didn't the other store have the good kind but the manufacturer had stopped making the good kind altogether.

Mom In Nightgown Mode
APPLETON, WI — Noting that the changeover occurred "right on schedule" after she had finished the dishes and watched TV for an hour or two, family sources confirmed Monday night that local mom Linda Rampling had officially transitioned into nightgown mode. "You can usually hear her coming downstairs in her slippers around 9:45 or so," said son Wes Rampling, 16, who noted that upon entering nightgown mode, his mother invariably goes around closing the downstairs curtains while waiting for the kettle to boil so she can make a cup of tea. "She'll go check to make sure the front door's locked, then she'll open the back door to see if the cat wants to come in before locking that up, too. Then she'll sit in the living room for a while and do about half a crossword puzzle. It's the same thing every night." According to sources, Linda Rampling reportedly progressed to the terminal phase of nightgown mode several minutes later upon applying avocado moisturizing cream to her face and retreating into her room with the latest Harper's Bazaar.

"Can I get that big one right there? Yep, that one," said the senior marketing manager, husband, and father of two while eagerly holding out his plastic plate in anticipation, having actively sought out the slice not only for its size but also because it had a full, intact icing flower on it. "Yeah, you got it. Perfect." At press time, Hinke was making room on his plate for a big scoop of ice cream.

Home Depot Employee Can Tell This Customer's First Attempt At Pipe Bomb
APPLETON, WI — Shaking his head Monday as the customer selected a length of plastic pipe over a stronger metal alternative and placed it into his shopping cart, local Home Depot sales associate Graham Warner, 57, was reportedly able to tell right away that this was the store patron's first attempt at making a pipe bomb. "Man, this guy has no idea what he's doing — he just picked up a bunch of round-head screws even though everyone knows the flat-head ones cause more bodily damage," said Warner, pointing out that the man had cluelessly grabbed end caps that wouldn't even fit the width of pipe he had selected. "He asked me where the batteries were, so I showed him, but then he just stood there staring at all the options for a few minutes before tentatively picking one out. Look, look at him now — oh, jeez, he has nowhere near enough wire for the fuse, and that's way too much chlorate fertilizer, though it's not going to do him any good since he got the one with dirt already mixed into it." According to reports, Warner sighed and rolled his eyes knowingly when the man returned to the store several hours later with his hand wrapped in gauze.

Friend Really Laying Into Self For Failing To Reply To Email Sooner
MONTCLAIR, NJ — Expressing deep regret for her "inexcusable" behavior, local 29-year-old Erin Griffith is said to have really laid into herself Monday for failing to reply to a friend's email sooner. "I am so, so sorry for the late response. I'm such an idiot," wrote Griffith in the belated email to her old college roommate, which reportedly began with an entire paragraph detailing all the reasons her reply was late and included nearly a dozen separate apologetic statements throughout the body of the message in which she raked herself over the coals for her tardiness. "I've been super busy with work and I was traveling the past two weekends, but that's absolutely no excuse. I should have written you back sooner." After eventually addressing her friend's original question in a brief paragraph, Griffith reportedly called back to her sense of contrition in the email's closing, saying "sorry again" and vowing that she would respond much quicker next time.

List Of Names On Gchat Sidebar Like A Portal Into Area Man's Past Lives
FRANKFORT, KY — Displaying nearly forgotten ghosts from his past like a hazy window through time, the list of names appearing on local resident Paul Thurman's Gchat sidebar read like a catalog of the man's former lives and identities, the 27-year-old graphic designer reported Wednesday. "There's a guy from my ultimate Frisbee team back in college, and there are a couple people from my old pub trivia group — and, oh yeah, that guy had a summer sublet in our apartment a couple years ago," said Thurman, caught off guard by the memories of so many bygone versions of himself as he scrolled through the long, green-dot-stippled monument to his erstwhile personas, interests, and aspirations. "There's a guy who wanted me to design his business's logo but I never heard back from him, some girls I dated once or twice, and a few coworkers from the Panera Bread where I used to work. And I think that Will Tyson down there might be the person who bought my old futon on Craigslist right before I moved out of Charlotte." According to reports, Thurman then lingered for a moment on the name of someone he reluctantly admitted had been in an a cappella group with him before hastily closing the mail application and telling reporters that some past lives were best not revisited.

Family Hoping Mother Knows Birthday Nature Walk A One-Time Thing
OSHKOSH, WI — Moments before they set out on a two-mile wilderness trail at a nearby state park, members of the Calverton family told reporters Friday they hoped their mother, Beth, realized her birthday nature walk was a one-time-only thing. "I know Mom's pretty excited, but if she thinks we're going to do this sort of thing again, she's sorely mistaken," said Calverton's 16-year-old son, Garrett, who explained that he, his sister, and his father had only agreed to the outing because his mother was turning 50, adding that she had better not get her hopes up and start believing this might become a regular activity. "If she wants to come back by herself and walk along the other trails, that's up to her. She just needs to know that today is a special occasion, and after this, we're all done as far as family walks go. This is it." Garrett Calverton went on to say that while he was willing to walk the whole trail without complaint, if his mother thought she could stop every 10 minutes to read each new sign explaining the area's native plants and animals, then she had another thing coming.

Man Just Waiting Tables Until Fundamental Structure Of U.S. Economy Changes
HAMPTON, VA — Explaining that his current employment situation is intended merely as a stopgap, local man Simon Goldinger, 23, confirmed Thursday that he only plans to wait tables until the fundamental structure of the American economy undergoes a complete overhaul. Goldinger, who started working as a server at the Whitecap Grill shortly after graduating college last spring, told reporters he took the job in order to make ends meet while he waits for the entire economic framework of the United States to be reorganized at the most basic level, creating a sufficient number of adequately paid opportunities for individuals with his level of education and experience. "I'm not going to be a waiter forever, just until the nation's job market becomes less reliant on service-sector positions, and a robust, knowledge-based economy can be built from the ground up and given time to flourish, generating more promising career paths that ensure long-term financial stability for members of the workforce like me," Goldinger said as he scoured several job-listing websites for signs of an unprecedented transformation in the country's economic foundations. "I've been working at Whitecap for about a year now, but once America goes through some massive fiscal changes and retools itself to an extent unseen since the Second World War, I'm sure I'll have some better options." "In any case, this will do for now," he added. Goldinger explained that he is comfortable working at the restaurant for the time being, as his wages and tips are just enough to pay his bills and cover his share of the rent on the small apartment he shares with two friends while he awaits groundbreaking changes in the labor policies of developing countries, such as onsite safety measures, minimum wage laws, and overtime policies that, if instituted and expanded over the course of years, might eventually make it cost-effective for American companies to move jobs back home, thus allowing him to find a more secure, salaried position. While conceding he had hoped to achieve more professional success by this time in his life, the Virginia native said he will just have to keep looking and trust that the current system through which resources are distributed, with the vast majority of wealth flowing to the richest 1 percent of the population instead of being reinvested in the middle class to create sustainable job growth and boost the standard of living, will be completely upended at some point in the not-too-distant future. "Waiting tables is just a temporary thing for me, so hopefully it's just a matter of time before the exponential gains in productivity from increased automation stop creating redundancies in the labor force and the job offers start rolling in," said Goldinger, who has on numerous occasions texted his friends to ask if they had heard of any game-changing disruptions to the economic status quo capable of reinventing the role workers like him will play in American life for generations to come. "Honestly, though, hanging around here and serving people food isn't the worst way to get by while I wait for the federal government to renegotiate trade agreements so they include enforcement mechanisms that require all participating nations to protect the rights of workers while simultaneously streamlining our own domestic corporate tax policies and regulatory structure, thereby ensuring that an advanced industrial country like the U.S isn't at a competitive disadvantage." He added, "Once that happens, I'm out of here." At press time, sources confirmed Goldinger was applying to graduate school, hoping that by the time he finishes another degree, a revolutionary full-scale reorientation of the nation's job market will allow him to earn enough money to pay back his crushing student loan debt.

7-Year-Old Unable To Maintain Single Cohesive Storyline While Playing With Action Figures
BROCKTON, MA — Saying the plot was jumping all over the place and had become extremely hard to follow, onlookers confirmed this afternoon that 7-year-old Brendan Milner has been unable to maintain a single cohesive storyline while playing with his action figures. By all accounts, the second-grader failed to adhere to any logical narrative arc, following one plotline for only a brief period of time before veering in wildly tangential directions as he acted out scenes with several of his favorite plastic toys, including the superhero Iron Man, the giant monster Godzilla, and professional wrestler John Cena. "I'll get you for that," said Milner, who violently slammed the figurine of Iron Man into the WWE World Heavyweight Champion toy and sent it flying across the living room, contradicting a scene from just moments earlier in which the pair were best friends searching for a magical crystal. "Nobody beats Iron Man. I have power blasters." "Wait. Look out, there's a bunch of hot lava coming out of a volcano," added the child, introducing another ill-conceived element into the already disjointed series of events. Sources confirmed that Milner's plot started out promisingly, with John Cena and Iron Man teaming up with a triceratops to prevent a giant fireball from destroying the Earth, but noted that within little more than a minute, the storyline started to lose any sense of cohesion. Numerous reports indicated that the group of action figures abruptly abandoned the original mission in order to focus their entire attention on bringing the Star Wars villain Darth Maul to justice, ostensibly leaving the planet in imminent danger. According to eyewitnesses, the story ultimately became impossible to follow, with a particularly jarring chain of incidents that involved the setting rapidly switching from outer space to beneath the ocean to a mummy's tomb, all in a matter of seconds. "Hurry, the bad guys are getting away," said Milner, flying a Lego Batcopter with one hand while making the Godzilla action figure flip across a couch cushion in pursuit of an entirely unknown adversary whose offenses were never specified. "We captured you. Now you're in jail." Onlookers listed more than a dozen inconsistencies in the child's playtime activity, as well as a number of perplexing events that seemed to come completely out of nowhere and have no bearing on the storyline whatsoever, including instances in which Milner smashed together the faces of Iron Man and a Barbie doll for several seconds, had the protagonists flee from three Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figures, and at one point, manipulated the John Cena toy to suplex a Playmobil farmer representing his second-grade classmate Tyler. Those familiar with the situation also expressed their frustration at Milner's heavy reliance on bringing dead characters back to life in order to move the plot along, specifically mentioning one gratuitous instance when a number of wooden blocks fell on a Spider-Man toy and killed him, only for the superhero to reappear two minutes later saying, "Follow me." Experts who were called upon to analyze the narrative noted that throughout the half hour spent playing with his action figures, the second-grader completely ignored basic elements of storytelling and chose instead to repeatedly introduce new dramatic situations, making the already sprawling and erratic plot even more confusing. "Not only was the narrative underdeveloped, but the actions never set into motion corresponding consequences," said Martin Elliott, a professor of creative writing at Princeton University, adding that the 7-year-old relied heavily on the "mentally lazy" plot device deus ex machina by frequently having a Transformers robot action figure or Happy Meal Minions toy show up from out of the blue to save the day. "As a result, the story skipped around haphazardly and created a sequence of disconnected events that even those paying close attention would be at a loss to decipher." "At one point, John Cena, who up until then had no superpowers whatsoever, suddenly gained the ability to fly at the very last minute to stop a rocket from crashing into the team's base," Elliot continued. "Unfortunately, it's inconsistent details in his narrative like this that ruin any chance of enjoyment for anyone trying to follow along." All onlookers agreed, however, that the ending of his storyline, in which a giant 7-year-old boy came down from the sky and destroyed the Earth, was an excellent twist.

Dad's Eyes Well Up At Sight Of Perfectly Packed Cooler
LURAY, VA — Beaming with pride after he slotted the final turkey sandwich into place, local dad Steve Fowler's eyes reportedly welled up Friday at the sight of a perfectly packed cooler for the family's weekend trip to the beach. "All the heavy stuff is at the bottom, the beer and soda bottles are neatly organized and surrounded by ice packs, and everything is ideally positioned for an even chill," said the misty-eyed father of three, who reportedly wiped away a tear as he ran his hand around the rim to verify that none of the contents would obstruct the lid from closing. "This is all going to be ice-cold when we open it. It's beautiful. I mean, it's just beautiful." At press time, the tight roll-up and compact stowage of the family's beach towels in the car trunk reportedly gave Fowler goose bumps.

Report: Friend Has Been Going By Middle Name This Whole Fucking Time
CALABASAS, CA — Astounded that it had never come up at any point in the six years they had known each other, local woman Lucy Reed, 25, reported Tuesday that her friend Nicole Silberthau had apparently been going by her middle name this whole fucking time. "Wait, Nicole's real first name is Katherine? Are you fucking kidding me?" said a visibly stunned Reed, who was alerted to her friend's given name while filling out a lease on a two-bedroom apartment that Silberthau had already signed, a discovery that reportedly set off a succession of puzzling questions in Reed's mind, ranging from why the hell her friend had kept this fact hidden for so long to why she would go out of her way to call herself "Nicole" when her actual first name was completely normal to begin with. "What the fuck? Katherine Silberthau? Jesus, it's like I don't even know who she is anymore." Reed noted that the incident was even worse than the time another of her friends, Chris Willetts, neglected to mention he was a "Jr." for nearly a year.

Late-Arriving Guest Encouraged To Load Up On Food Sitting In Sun For Past 4 Hours
HARTFORD, CT — Insisting there was still plenty left to eat, local party hosts Dana and Mark Randolph reportedly encouraged late-arriving guest Jonathan Morse this weekend to load up on food that had been sitting out in the sun for the past four hours. "We've got a whole spread, so just grab a plate and dig in," said the Randolphs, pointing their guest toward a table filled with a variety of dried-out cheese slices, wilted salad greens, mushy coleslaw, and discolored guacamole that had been exposed to direct sunlight for the entire afternoon. "You definitely have to try Dana's potato salad — it's really good [and disgusting now], and there's a few hot dogs left [in a cloudy puddle of hot dog juice]. Help yourself." Sources later confirmed that Morse had fished a can of lukewarm beer out of a cooler filled with murky water.

Each Member Of Family On Edge As Vacation Has Gone By Without One Blowout Fight
MYRTLE BEACH, SC — Growing more and more anxious as their trip nears its end, members of the Mosshart family confided to reporters Friday they have felt increasingly on edge knowing their vacation has gone by without a single blowout fight between them. According to reports, Greg and Linda Mosshart, along with their children, Olivia and Danny, have shared a small hotel suite in Myrtle Beach for almost a week and have become more tense with each passing day. The four family members have reportedly eaten all their meals together, engaged in all the same recreational activities, and spent nearly every waking hour in one another's company, a situation they each independently confirmed had led to a steady increase in stress and aggravation, but which, they noted, had yet to devolve into an explosive altercation. Family sources stated that given their accumulated frustrations and ongoing close contact with one another, a major blowup was expected at any moment. "It's kind of weird, but Dad has barely yelled at any of us since we got here," said Danny, 16, explaining that the family has had a few arguments here and there, but nothing that has spiraled into the kind of intense, drawn-out shouting match they have typically experienced by this point in previous trips. "No one's really thrown a fit at all. Maybe it'll happen tomorrow morning when we're trying to load up the car quickly so we can get to the airport on time. It's gotta be just a matter of time, though." "I keep watching everybody and wondering who's going to be the first to completely flip their shit," he added. "Honestly, I have no idea how Mom hasn't broken down in tears yet." Family members went on to speculate that the anticipated outburst of hostility could well occur during tomorrow's 45-minute drive to the rental car return facility, or even sooner given tonight's plans for dinner at a popular and typically crowded restaurant. If there is a long wait for a table, if either of the children complains about the menu, or if one of the parents becomes agitated by how much the meal winds up costing, it is widely believed all hell will break lose. The Mossharts further acknowledged that the relative peace they are experiencing is so tenuous that even a single sarcastic remark or a word muttered under someone's breath could be the flashpoint that makes everyone erupt into a flurry of name-calling, accusations, and loud public theatrics. "I was sure it was going to happen the first day when we spent half an hour looking for a parking spot by the boardwalk," said Olivia, 15, recalling how her father, who was driving the car, cursed and pounded on the steering wheel after accidentally passing by an available space that was quickly taken by another vehicle. "He got really annoyed and told us to turn off the radio, even though he was the one who put it on in the first place. Things were looking pretty bad, but everyone calmed down when he found another spot a few blocks away. I think that was the closest call we've had." According to reports, the family's sense of imminent dread is the result of past vacations that have always featured prominent explosions of temper, among them a camping trip last summer in which Olivia capped a protracted tantrum by screaming "I hate you" at her mother before storming off to sulk in the car, and an excursion to the Grand Canyon during which Danny whined that he was bored, causing Greg to slam on the brakes, pull over, and admonish everyone for not appreciating how much time and money had been spent on the vacation. While the Mossharts admitted it was possible the beach trip could go by without anyone flying off the handle, the children observed that it isn't likely considering how upset their mother became yesterday when she tried unsuccessfully to cajole and motivate her husband and kids to walk the half mile down to the pier to take a family photo together. After the suggestion was repeatedly rebuffed, reports indicate she went so far as to purse her lips and say, "You know…" before stopping herself, a sentence everyone assumed would be finished by the time the trip was over. "It might happen when I have to wake the kids up early tomorrow, or maybe when we all go through security at the airport, but I can almost guarantee that someone's going to have a meltdown, and probably a pretty dramatic one at this point," said Linda, who cringed when discussing how unbearable the next morning will likely be given that no one has begun to pack. "We have to make it to the airport by 5:30 in the morning and then we'll all be waiting around in the terminal together. Christ, I just hope the flight's not delayed." At press time, each of the family members conceded that if they somehow managed to make it through the vacation without a major blowout, they would simply take their simmering, combustible resentment home with them.

Mom Declares Garage Her Next Big Project
DES MOINES, IA — Announcing to family members it was getting "just about impossible" to find anything out there, local mother Pam Westin, 53, declared Friday that the garage is her next big project, sources confirmed. "Jeez, the garage is just so full of clutter you can barely walk around in there — that's going to be my next project," said Westin, issuing the proclamation to all within earshot in the kitchen and adjoining dining area, before vowing to set aside a whole weekend to bring the same order and tidiness to the garage that she had previously brought to the basement and, most recently, the front hall closet. "I'm going to go through all those old boxes that have probably been there since we moved in and make a pile of all the sports equipment we don't need anymore and give it to Goodwill. It really is one big mess in there. It took me a half hour to find my garden shears last week, and I don't even know where the old blue cooler went. There's probably things in there we forgot we had." At press time, the family's father, Don Westin, released a statement pushing back the initiation of his shed cleanout project by another three weeks.

Seagull This Far Inland Must Be Total Fuckup
KNOXVILLE, TN — Questioning how the bird could have possibly ended up more than 300 miles from the nearest ocean, sources confirmed Friday that a seagull that was spotted this far inland must be a total fuckup. Several eyewitnesses, who watched the seagull aimlessly wander around a Target parking lot that was located two whole states away from any coastal habitat that could provide proper food, shelter, and protection to the animal, told reporters the bird was more than likely a complete shit-for-brains and a huge fucking embarrassment to its species. "Wow, that numbskull must have really fucking messed up," said Erin Hampton, who reportedly saw the sorry-ass seagull pathetically eating smashed-up French fries off of a dirty sidewalk that, she was quick to confirm, was not a goddamn beach. "Come on, dum-dum, get your shit together. The ocean's that way." "God, what a shitty bird," Hampton continued. Numerous sources recalled seeing the seagull loudly squawking for no fucking reason while perched on top of a shopping cart return and speculated that the dimwitted bird probably became lost while trying to migrate with its head up its ass. In addition, sources reported that the dumb-as-a-stump seagull, which they confirmed likely possessed zero fucking natural instincts, probably couldn't even tell the difference between a body of water and a paved asphalt surface. A number of Knoxville residents informed reporters that the miserable dumbfuck was clearly a complete failure at being a seabird and questioned where the hell the major fuckup expected to build a nest in the middle of a busy strip mall parking lot that lacks sand or grass and is situated seven hours away from a fucking shore. Residents also reportedly assumed that the gull, which was for some reason residing in an entirely landlocked state even though 70 percent of the planet's goddamn surface is covered with water, absolutely shit the bed at any chance it had at mating. "I bet the rest of the flock just hates this stupid asshole," said passerby Jason Lowe, shaking his head in disgust before adding that it was probably for the best that the fucking idiot seagull didn't procreate and pass on its shitty genetic material. "The dumb fucker isn't even trying to get back to the ocean. Can it even fly? It's just hopping around like a dope. What the hell is it looking for?" "Christ, you're not going to find any fish on the cement," continued Lowe. "Fucking doofus." At press time, sources confirmed that the goddamn mess of a bird was just flying around in circles above the parking lot like a huge dipshit.

Report: Annie Sabatino's Boyfriend Like 23 Or Something
RIDGEWOOD, NJ — Corroborating evidence gleaned from several purported sightings of the couple, lunchroom sources reported Tuesday that the boyfriend of high school junior Annie Sabatino is like 23 or something. "I heard from Jessie Kennedy's sister that he's a bartender somewhere — he's, like, out of college," said classmate Julie Adamo, 17, who plays field hockey with Sabatino and said she saw the unknown older man pick her up from a game on Friday in a "Honda or something," and it looked like he had a full beard. "Lindsay [O'Donnell] said he lives in an apartment in Wycoff with a couple of roommates. She says he has a bunch of tattoos. You think Annie's parents know about it?" Sources were unable to confirm further reports claiming that, because she's dating a 23-year-old, Sabatino can get into any bar now, no questions asked.

Report: Some Crazy Shit Probably Happened To Classmate Being Raised By Grandmother
DENTON, MD — Gathering in the school's hallways and around lunch tables to exchange stories about the 11-year-old, students at McLane Junior High reported Monday that some crazy shit must have happened to their classmate Jacob Morse, who is currently being raised by his grandmother. "Remember last year, when his grandma came to our winter concert but his parents didn't? That's when I was like, whoa, something's probably really messed up with him," said fellow sixth-grader Ryan Herrera to a small group of his friends, just several of the dozens of students who were actively speculating what totally batshit insane circumstances could have led Morse to end up getting dropped off at school every day in an old station wagon by a woman in her mid-60s, and not his mother or father. "I heard that Kevin [Freeland] stayed over at Jacob's house and his grandma opened the door and let him in, and she made dinner for them, and then drove Kevin home the next morning. Kevin said that no one mentioned anything about where Jacob's mom or dad were at all. So you know whatever happened had to have been real, real bad." Members of Morse's class later added that they didn't even want to think about what was up with their other classmate who moved in from out of state halfway through the year and stayed for two months before moving again without explanation.

Office Manager Unveils New Rule
WARREN, MI — Stipulating that the regulation would take effect immediately, Summit Industries office manager Angela Werner reportedly unveiled a new rule Tuesday in a company-wide email. "I just wanted to give everyone a heads-up that employees are no longer allowed to print color copies of documents," read the email from Werner, who also promulgated her new decree by taping a piece of paper bearing the restriction on the wall near the office printer. "The toner cartridges aren't cheap and they get used up too quickly. So from this point forward, please print in black and white. Thanks." At press time, Werner was reportedly composing a new statute after finding out that the printer's paper tray had not been refilled.

New Altar Boy Clearly Not Ready For Spotlight Of 10 A.M. Sunday Mass
COATESVILLE, PA — Calling his bowing and candle-work "sloppy at best," parishioners at Holy Family Church told reporters yesterday that new altar boy Christopher Mains, 11, was clearly not ready for the spotlight of the 10 a.m. Sunday Mass. "As soon as that kid got to the altar and barely even genuflected, I knew he was in way over his head. This is Sunday morning; you've got to be on your A-game," said church attendee Betsy Pollana, noting that she might expect that kind of performance at a 7 p.m. Wednesday Mass, or possibly even at 5:30 on Saturday, but certainly not at the main event. "He rang the bell way too late during consecration, he had no clue how to hold a thurible, and frankly, I'm at a loss for what he thought he was doing during the communion. Sorry, but until you've got your routine locked down, you've got no business headlining Sunday." Pollana added that if she so much as saw Mains processing down the aisle next Sunday, she'd walk straight out of the church and not come back until the 1:30 p.m. Mass.

Learned Sage Points Out That Powerball Not As Much After Taxes
BELLEVUE, WA — Imparting his profound enlightenment and worldly understanding onto all who would heed his words, local billing clerk and learned sage Cameron Wenzel reportedly pointed out Wednesday that the Powerball jackpot is not worth as much after taxes. "They say the jackpot's $1.5 billion, but you don't actually get all of that," the keenly perceptive man of learning informed several coworkers, allowing them to ponder his illuminating pronouncement for several moments before shrewdly explaining that the government "takes a whole lot of it." "You don't get even close to that much. If you think you're getting the whole thing, you're in for a big surprise." Sources confirmed that the wise guru then offered those gathered in the office break room one final insightful teaching, saying that were he himself to win, the first thing he would do is hire a tax adviser.

Family At Restaurant Reminds Grandma What Food She Likes
SPLENDORA, TX — As they carefully guided her through the menu at local eatery Republic Bistro Friday, the family of grandmother Barbara LeBlanc, 81, reportedly made a point of reminding her what foods she likes. "Oh, look, a Mediterranean chicken panini! You could have that. It's basically just a chicken sandwich, and you like chicken," said LeBlanc's daughter Rachel Hallowell, explaining how the melted cheese and tomato slices made the sandwich similar to others she has liked in the past. "Or how about the Greek salad? You had one of those when we went out to dinner for Timmy's graduation, and you said it was very good." After LeBlanc reportedly pointed to the penne all'arrabbiata and suggested she might enjoy that, her relatives were quick to remind her that she hates spicy peppers.

Friend From College Wasted No Time Becoming White-Collar Professional
CHARLOTTE, NC — Noting how his fellow 23-year-old now takes business trips and apparently has a company-issued cell phone, local barista Daniel MacKenzie reported Friday that his friend Eric Sanford — with whom MacKenzie attended the University of Virginia from 2011 to 2015 — has wasted no time at all becoming a full-fledged white-collar professional. "The last time I saw Eric was at graduation about a year ago, but then we met up for beers last week and he was wearing a button-down shirt and mentioning something about having to move meetings around to see me — boy, he got right into that whole thing real fast," said MacKenzie, noting that the message from his one-time intramural broom hockey co-captain arranging the meetup for drinks contained an appended email signature identifying him as an "Associate." "After I told him about how I'm trying to decide whether to go back to school for something or maybe apply for an internship, he complained about how he had to give a presentation to some clients. Then he said he could 'expense' the meal. I have no idea how he got to this point." MacKenzie and Sanford are said to have found some common ground, however, when collectively shaking their heads at how their third roommate, Charles, had wasted no time going back to the job at GameStop he had held back in high school.

Takeout Burrito Shielded From Cold As Though It Were Week-Old Newborn
NEW YORK — Clutching the tinfoil-wrapped bundle tightly to her chest as she emerged from a local taqueria, area woman Caroline Parrish tenderly shielded her takeout burrito from the cold as though it were a week-old newborn, sources confirmed Friday. "I'll get you home soon, my love — just a few more minutes," whispered Parrish, nestling the rolled mass of spicy steak and beans within the folds of her jacket to ensure it could not be chilled by the wind as she carefully sidestepped patches of ice and affectionately cradled her cherished lunch item to ensure its fragile form was fully supported. "Don't worry, I've got you." At press time, Parrish was terrified to realize her burrito had been switched with someone else's.

Mom Thinks You'd Enjoy Restaurant She Can't Remember Name Of Right Now
ST. LOUIS — Noting that both she and your father thought everything about the place was just right up your alley, your mother confirmed Wednesday that she believes you'd really enjoy a new restaurant in town whose name she can't quite remember at the moment. "I can't for the life of me think of what it's called, but I'm telling you, you'd love it," said your mom, adding that the recently opened establishment, which she reported was done really nice inside, was located down over in that area where they built all those new shops. "Everything we got was absolutely delicious. I ordered something that was a lot like that dish I like from the Italian place down the road, and your dad's food came with this amazing sauce I'd never heard of before — hey, honey? What did they say was in that chicken thing you ordered the other night?" Your mother further suggested taking your friends there sometime and making a whole night out of it, saying the people at the next table were just raving about whatever kind of wine they were drinking.

Pathetic Excuse For Man Paid Same Wage As Female Counterpart
LAFAYETTE, LA — Calling the situation pitiful and completely embarrassing, sources confirmed Friday that pathetic excuse for a man Pete Atkins is paid the exact same wage as his coworker and fellow claims adjuster Melanie Hall, who is a woman. Reports indicate that, despite having the same job title, as well as comparable educational backgrounds, prior job experience, and performance reviews with their current employer, Hall and the weak, neutered man are each paid $55,000 per year for their role. While they both carry out the same duties and responsibilities and have both been employed with the company for four years, sources stated that, based on the identical amount of money deposited into their bank accounts each pay period, the woman and the emasculated little runt are considered equally valuable to the business in the eyes of their supervisor. Those familiar with the situation also confirmed that Atkins, who is a source of shame to males everywhere and has essentially been stripped of all his manhood, will likely be considered just as dispensable as his female peer during this year's rounds of company layoffs.

13-Year-Old Excited To Learn Unemployed Older Brother Forced To Move Back Home After College
GAHANNA, OH — Talking about how fun it will be to "hang out like old times," local 13-year-old Joey Watkins expressed excitement Thursday upon learning his older brother, who in the current job market has found no prospects for employment, has no choice but to move back home after college. The eighth-grader was reportedly overjoyed by the news that his 22-year-old brother, Derek, will return to live in his parents' house after his graduation from Ohio State University, where he has spent much of his senior year researching companies and applying for jobs and internships, but to no avail. "Man, it'll be great having Derek around all the time," Joey said of the depressed and frustrated economics major, who, despite expanding his job search far beyond his areas of interest and sending applications all over the country, cannot find even part-time work among the present supply of entry-level positions. "I haven't seen him in so long. He was really busy this semester, so he hasn't been around much since Christmas." "I can't wait to help him unload all his stuff and move back into his room," Joey continued. "We're gonna have so much fun!" Sources confirmed Derek will be staying indefinitely in his old childhood bedroom, which was converted into a home office when he left for college in 2012. According to reports, while Derek was investigating the steps to procuring a real estate license last weekend in a desperate bid to find any source of employment, Joey was helping his parents clean out the room and move his brother's furniture back in, with the younger sibling reportedly noting how he wanted to make everything look just as it did four years ago so Derek would feel at home. Joey also conveyed his hopes that Derek — who in his fruitless attempts to find work contacted at least a dozen recruiters online, met with three different career counselors, and attended numerous networking events — will return to his old summer job at the local cineplex so the two brothers can go see movies together for free the way they used to. "We'll be able to go to the batting cages every day — it'll be awesome," said Joey, whose older brother reportedly has only $500 to his name and hopes to save as much as he can to cover travel expenses to potential job interviews, should he be fortunate enough to land one anytime soon. "There's so much cool stuff we'll finally get a chance to do once Derek is home and doesn't have a bunch of work to do all the time." "He'll even be able to drive me to the mall on days when Mom doesn't need the car," Joey added. Reports indicate that while the younger Watkins has already compiled a long list of things to do with his brother, one that includes watching baseball games, going to McDonald's, and swimming at a local pool, the college graduate is expected to spend most of his time hunched over a computer scrolling through job listings and sending out résumés in search of any freelance or temp position he can possibly take as a stopgap until something more permanent comes along. Sources added that upon learning of Derek's return, Joey immediately texted "See you soon!" to the graduating senior, who, though he has had trouble sleeping recently due to his constant anxiety, continues to research last-ditch job prospects while also writing term papers and preparing for final exams. "I just got the new FIFA, which is perfect because we can play all weekend after his graduation," said Joey, whose brother will within weeks grow discouraged by his unsuccessful job search and sink into a state of deep, debilitating despair that will cause him to give up looking altogether. "It'll be so cool. I hope he stays for a really long time."

Mom Sits Down For Dinner 3 Months After Rest Of Family Finishes Meal
NOVI, MI — Having insisted that her husband and three kids start without her, local mother Cheryl Lenox sat down for dinner three months after the rest of her family finished their meal, sources confirmed Monday. "Mmm, this smells good," Lenox reportedly said out loud to an empty kitchen table as she finally sat down with a plate of roast pork and vegetables she had prepared for her family back on December 19 of last year. "Oh, I might need to heat this up for a few minutes." Sources confirmed that Lenox was able to eat four bites of the meal before she was summoned to get up and pack lunches for her family.

PITTSBURGH — Providing several reassurances about the quality of his previous night's rest, bleary-eyed, stuporous houseguest Ken Hodge informed host Jeremy Muller this morning that he slept really great, sources confirmed. "Yeah, I was pretty comfy," said the drowsy, sluggish 29-year-old, who restlessly tossed and turned throughout the night while attempting to find a comfortable sleeping position on the sagging cushions of Muller's sofa. "That's a nice couch. I was out like a light." At press time, Hodge confirmed that the scratchy blanket that barely covered his entire body had kept him "nice and cozy."

Man Googling 'Tender Lump On Neck' About To Begin Exciting New Phase In Life
NATICK, MA — Entirely unbeknownst to him, 45-year-old local resident Timothy Lang stood on the threshold of an exciting new phase in his life Monday as he typed the phrase "tender lump on neck" into Google's search bar, sources reported. The simple act of entering the particular set of search terms into his internet browser and pressing the return key on his laptop is said to have suddenly opened a fresh new chapter in the man's life, one that will soon introduce him to dozens of strangers and scores of novel, indelible experiences, while also fundamentally changing his relationships with friends and family, and leading him to make major alterations to his lifestyle. Further reports indicate that the split second between when he finished typing and the moment his search results appeared onscreen would be the last time Lang recognizes himself as the person he is now, as core aspects of the local bank manager's very identity will, according to sources, begin to undergo immediate and significant transformations. At press time, Lang was reportedly searching the phrase "tender lump vs. tumor," an action ironically intended to stem the onrushing deluge of profound life changes, but which will only serve to greatly accelerate his entry into the next phase of his existence.

Waitress Who Took Over At Table Just Doesn't Have Same Spark As Richard
FREEPORT, ME — Sensing things wouldn't be the same once the woman removed their empty potato skin basket without so much as a playful acknowledgment of how much they must have enjoyed the appetizer, patrons at Downeast Grill confirmed Wednesday night that their new waitress, Allie, just didn't have the same spark Richard had. "When Allie came by to say that Richard's shift was over and that she'd be taking care of us now, I could tell immediately that she wasn't going to ask us how our day's been going or compliment us on our choice of entrees like Richard did," said diner Peter Bagnell, wistfully recalling the zeal with which his party's former server listed off the specials and how at one point, before taking his order, Richard had called him "buddy." "We get it that she's doing her job, and yes, she's bringing out the food and whatnot, but Richard had a twinkle in his eye even when we told him we needed another minute or two to settle on what we wanted — it was clear he really wanted to be here. When Allie comes around to refill the water, you can tell she's just going through the motions." Bagnell went on to disparage the fact that Allie had passed right by their table without asking them how their food was tasting, something they asserted Richard "would never have done."

Toddler Really Yanking On Penis, Report Wincing Sources
HOPEWELL, NJ — Trying unsuccessfully to ignore the child as he grasped his genitals between his thumb and index finger, wincing sources reported Wednesday that local boy Jacob Faldonna, 2, was really yanking on his penis hard. "Oh boy," the incredibly uncomfortable sources reportedly thought to themselves as they tried to carry on a normal conversation despite the toddler tugging firmly at his penis and then releasing it, giving it pull after pull, over and over again. "God, he's still doing it." At press time, sources confirmed the child had momentarily heeded his father's stern admonishment that "We don't do that" before grabbing his foreskin and stretching it out as far as it would go.

Shamefaced Man Stands Stock-Still As Acquaintance Zips Up Backpack For Him
MEDFORD, OR — Overcome with humiliation after being stopped on his way out of the office and informed his backpack was wide open, local billing specialist Dennis Lee, 30, reportedly stood stock-still Friday as coworker Mike Faziola zipped the bag up for him. "Oh, hold on, your backpack's open. Let me get that," said Faziola, as Lee — standing in full view of numerous colleagues — gritted his teeth, bent his knees slightly, and squeezed his shoulder straps tightly in his fists while he waited for the act to be over. "There you go. Don't want your stuff falling out onto the street." Sources confirmed that Lee's few remaining shreds of self-respect were then swept away when, without any warning, Faziola grabbed the shame-ridden man's sweatshirt hood, which had gotten twisted and bunched up underneath his backpack, and straightened it out for him.

Mom Has Stacked Dinner Party Roster
GOLDEN, CO — Their eyes widening in amazement as the 43-year-old rattled off the names of heavy hitter after heavy hitter, impressed members of the Dreeshen household confirmed Friday that the roster for their mom's upcoming dinner party was absolutely stacked. "Wow, she's got Joyce from work, Cheri, Dana from yoga, Carol, Carol's new husband — that's all of the A-listers, together under one roof," said Dreeshen's daughter Michelle, wondering aloud how her mother managed to nail down such a jam-packed murderers' row of neighborhood all-stars. "Jesus, she even managed to pull Dr. Fuller and the Jacobsons. Top to bottom, it's just loaded. There's not a single weak spot in the entire guest list." Sources reported that such an imposing, big-name lineup would "absolutely crush" the likely dinner party topics of the Wannemakers' new deck and Carol's upcoming trip to Italy with her son's choral group.

WOBURN, MA―Noting that she had somehow managed to sleep through both the dawn chorus of birds and her neighborhood's early morning garbage pickup, 53-year-old local mother Laura Maloney confirmed that she did not awaken Monday until after the sun had risen. "Oh my gosh, it's light out already!" said Maloney, adding that she could not believe how late it was and that she would have to leave for work in less than three hours. "I'm so mad at myself. This is going to throw me off and make it impossible to fall asleep at a reasonable time tonight. I'll probably be up until 9." Maloney went on to acknowledge that she should have known better than to stay awake to watch all of 60 Minutes the previous night.

CHICAGO — Brazenly strolling through the rows of desks while pointing out the firm's various departments to his two guests, Lodestone Media intern Nate Kapper, 19, made the incredibly bold move of giving his parents a tour of the company's offices Wednesday, sources reported. "He brought his family through in the middle of the afternoon, and, right in front of everyone, he said, 'This is the desk where I work,'" communications manager Laura Dao said of the cavalier 15-hour-a-week employee who started two months ago and is sent home early most days due to a lack of tasks to complete. "And then, once he'd walked his parents around the entire floor, he went up to [senior director] Mary [Fullman] and introduced his parents to her directly. I think he even called her 'a good boss.' " Sources later confirmed seeing the teenager who earns a $350 monthly stipend taking his parents into the kitchen, where he offered them their choice of coffee or tea.

Mom Apologizing For Going Through Menopause
LUTSEN, MN — According to witnesses, local mother Deborah Miller, 49, apologized to her family profusely Monday for going through the natural biological process of menopause. "Gosh, I am so sorry — I know it's cold in here, but I'm having a hot flash," said Miller as she cracked open a window in the den, fanned herself with a nearby magazine while her husband and two sons watched television, and repeatedly asked them for forgiveness for her ovaries ceasing to release eggs and her decreased estrogen production, physical and chemical changes that happen to every woman during her lifetime and over which Miller has no control. "I really hope I'm not bothering anyone. This won't last long, I promise. Sorry, sorry." Sources added that Miller later apologized softly to no one in particular for the perfectly normal stage of life when she stepped on several loud floorboards late at night during a bout of hormone-related insomnia while everyone else in her family was sound asleep.

Impressive New Hire Figures Out Bare Minimum Of Work Job Requires On First Day
MILWAUKEE — Marveling at his extraordinary ability to learn the ropes at the technology firm and quickly fit right in with the rest of his colleagues, sources at Starpoint Solutions confirmed Thursday that impressive new hire Eric Myers has already figured out the bare minimum of work his job requires on the very first day. "The second Eric showed up today, he sat right down at his desk, fired off a few quick emails, and then spent the next couple hours browsing Facebook — he's really got the hang of this," said coworker Janice Grant, who expressed a deep respect for how swiftly Myers learned the ins and outs of putting in an hour or two of minor effort, telling supervisors that he was going to need extra time to work on assignments, and then coasting through the rest of the workday. "It took me a few months before I had a firm grasp on cutting corners, blowing off tasks, and doing a half-assed job on stuff so I could just kick back most of the day. Eric's a natural, though; he just has an innate knack for phoning it in." At press time, several employees were reportedly shaking their heads in surprise and admiration after noticing their new coworker had taken an hour and a half for lunch.

Depression Symptom Checklist Speaking To Area Man As No Poem Ever Could
SYRACUSE, NY — Saying the bulleted list of diagnostic criteria had touched something at the very core of his being, local 34-year-old Adam Zenner reported Friday that an online depression symptoms checklist was speaking to him as no poem ever could. "When I read those words for the first time, I was completely mesmerized — it's almost like the part about persistent sad and anxious feelings was written just for me," said Zenner, adding that no piece of writing had ever resonated with him as deeply as the checklist's stirring opening lines about changes in appetite and the tendency to fixate on past failures. "I can't tell you how many times I've read it. There's one section in particular, about having difficulty concentrating and making decisions, that I keep coming back to again and again because I just connect with it on some deep existential level. It's hard to explain, but it's like these 12 short lines have completely reshaped my world." At press time, an awed Zenner was rereading the "absolutely perfect" closing line about suicidal ideation.

Materialistic Single Mom Constantly Thinking Of Money
MAPLE GROVE, MN — Noting her obsessive desire for acquiring wealth and physical possessions, local sources confirmed Friday that materialistic single mother of three Jillian Ferguson is constantly thinking about money. "I really need next Friday's paycheck today, or there's no way I can get new clothes for the kids," said the insatiable woman who is reportedly singularly focused on wanting more and more money to buy more things. "It'd be really nice to get a little overtime on my next shift; then I might be able to swing getting a few groceries and pay off some of the bills." At press time, several reports indicated that the superficial mother was actually crying about her lack of material possessions.

Man To Undergo Extensive Interrogation By Coworkers About Where He Got Falafel
DENVER — Removing the Middle Eastern specialty from its paper carryout bag as he returned to his office desk, local insurance salesman Robert Devinshire reportedly braced himself Monday to undergo an extensive interrogation from his coworkers about where he got falafel. "Oh, God, before I even get to take one bite of this thing, I know [account managers] Ray [Gallo] and Liz [Farrell] will be over here grilling me, demanding to know the name and location of the restaurant," said Devinshire, worried that the scent of warm, fried chickpea and tahini had already begun attracting colleagues from nearby cubicles, each of whom would soon bombard him with inquiries on whether the restaurant was new or if he grabbed a menu. "It's only a matter of moments before they're surrounding my desk, ordering me to tell them everything I know about how long the line was and cross-examining me about what other dishes were available. I better try to eat this thing quickly before the whole department shows up." At press time, a chewing Devinshire was responding to an onslaught of questions about the sandwich's taste, price, and contents with a series of muffled one-word answers and thumbs-ups.

Sweating, Trembling Mom Still Coming Down From High Of Having Kids Under One Roof
DENVER — Breathing heavily and leaning against the wall for support as beads of sweat formed on her forehead, local mother Cynthia Applin struggled to lower her heart rate Monday as she came down from the high of having all three of her adult children under the same roof, sources reported. "Oh, my God, the three of them were just here, talking and sharing family meals together — that was so intense," the tremoring 55-year-old said, reeling from a spell of dizziness as she described the euphoria of seeing her 27-year-old son, 24-year-old daughter, and college-age son all seated next to one another at the dinner table. "I was buzzed out of my mind when they all arrived a few days ago, but when I realized they were each sleeping in their childhood bedrooms right down the hall from me, it felt like I was flying straight upward and my heart was ready to burst — I could barely even handle it. God, what a fucking rush." At press time, sources reported that Applin had decided to chase another high by looking at some old photos of her children in their Easter clothes.

Man Honestly Thought Breakdown Would Be More Obvious To People
MAPLEWOOD, MN — Explaining that he had assumed the deterioration of his physical and psychological state would be readily apparent, 3M sales associate Mark Uhler told reporters Wednesday he honestly thought his ongoing breakdown would be more obvious to everyone around him. "Given how many times in the past month I've showed up to work on two hours of sleep and just stared at my computer in total silence, I'd kind of expected someone to ask me if everything's all right at home or at least tell me I look tired lately, but so far I haven't heard a thing," said Uhler, adding that he thought the frequency with which he places his face in his hands and mutters morosely to himself would have been a clear indication that he was completely unraveling and prompted somebody at some point to stop by his cubicle. "I was sure when our HR manager asked me to speak with her last week it would be to discuss why I constantly look like I'm on the verge of tears during meetings, but it turns out she just wanted to explain changes to our 401K plan. I feel like my entire life is collapsing and I can barely stay afloat, but every email I get from coworkers is just about jumping on a client call or finishing up my monthly reports." When reached for comment, Uhler's colleagues confirmed they had noticed his breakdown weeks ago but simply didn't give a shit.

Coworker Who Just Threw Fit And Stormed Out Of Room Looked Like Total Badass
HARTFORD, CT — Noting that they had never seen such a bold and impressive show of dominance, Burkart Industries employees confirmed Monday that account analyst Ken Perlis just looked like a total badass when he threw a fit and stormed out of the room during a meeting. "He closed his laptop right in the middle of Dave's presentation, whined for a little while that he was tired of no one listening to his ideas, and walked right out — it was the most epic thing I've ever seen," said awestruck witness Jessica Gelber, adding that the complete rebel had raised his voice to such a volume during his tantrum that people could hear him through the conference room wall. "He paused in the doorway as if he was about to say something, but instead just rolled his eyes and sighed really loud. Then he slammed the door behind him — actually slammed it on the rest of us. Just a beast." At press time, the most undeniably hardcore employee the company had ever seen was carefully composing an apology email to his supervisor.

Self-Deprecating Man Just Scratching Surface Of How Pathetic He Actually Is
MILL VALLEY, CA — Noting that there are dozens of awful aspects of his personality that he hasn't even begun to address, sources confirmed Monday that local 28-year-old Ryan Glass' constant self-deprecation only scratches the surface of how truly pathetic he is. "I should just apologize to people in advance when they try to get in touch with me; it always takes me forever to return texts or phone calls," said the insufficiently self-effacing man who, in addition to glossing over the genuine irritation and alienation he causes his friends by ignoring their attempts to connect, regularly offers minor critiques of his physical appearance, professional skills, athletic ability, sexual performance, fashion sense, financial competence, and general demeanor that in no way capture the full extent of such attributes' pitifulness. "I'm just a flake like that. I know I should respond right away, but being the space cadet I am, I always get distracted by something else and forget." Sources added that Glass was only able to provide an accurately harsh appraisal of character flaws when describing the faults of his friends and coworkers.

College Accepts Safety Student Just In Case Top Choices Don't Work Out
OMAHA, NE — In an effort to be fully prepared for potential rejections, Creighton University admissions officers reportedly accepted a safety student Wednesday just in case their top choices didn't work out. "Rachel Fulton from Roseville, Minnesota certainly isn't one of the best students in the country, but we felt we needed to have a decent backup if our other options turn us down," said undergraduate admissions officer Laura Kleinman, adding that the school had to be realistic and not risk gambling away everything on a reach student they had little chance of getting. "Obviously, we'd love to have our dream student, Dave Hirschman, and we could definitely see ourselves with Angela Ramirez, too. But everybody's trying to get those two, so it's a longshot for us. Rachel's a decent enough student, if that's what we're left with." At press time, Kleinman expressed concerns that they might have to swallow their pride and accept a community college transfer if Fulton fell through.

Man Returning From Vacation Settles On Single Concise Anecdote He'll Tell Everyone Who Asks
ST. LOUIS — Carefully choosing the exact details and wording in order to maximize its impact in a very brief period of time, local man Kyle Perry settled on a single concise anecdote that he will tell every person who asks about his vacation to the Bahamas, sources confirmed Thursday. "I'll start with the weather, which was cloudy at first but then cleared up — that's a pretty reliable entry point," said the 32-year-old Perry, adding that while his hotel wasn't sufficiently interesting to merit inclusion in his short narrative, he was prepared to succinctly characterize it as "small but nice" if inquiries were specifically made. "I'll tell them that I tried grouper for the first time and liked it. Then I'll get to the highlight when I went scuba diving and brushed up against a huge manta ray. Ideally, I'd mention my funny cab driver, but I really don't want this to turn into a whole thing, so I'll probably just skip it." Perry went on to say that he would then wrap up by stating he had a great time and would definitely go back, and that would be that.

Worker Who Forgot Email Attachment Expects Coworkers To Forgive Her Just Like That
UPPER DARBY, PA — In a shameless attempt to persuade colleagues to excuse her incompetent mistake, local account supervisor Casey Collins, who forgot to include an email attachment earlier today, apparently expected her coworkers to forgive her just like that, shocked sources confirmed. "She thinks she can carelessly leave out the document, follow up with the line 'Sorry guys, here it is!' and expect us to straight up forgive her? Unbelievable," said coworker Marc Graham, glaring at the audacious message, which reportedly concluded with "my bad" in a final, desperate attempt to atone for the egregious error. "She's lucky she remembered to attach the file so quickly afterward, but if she thinks that wiped the slate clean, then she is sorely mistaken. Maybe a few months from now, but just a couple minutes after she did something like this? No way." At press time, sources confirmed that a number of seething colleagues had slammed their laptops shut and stormed out of the office to collect themselves.

Mom's Fears About Daughter Leaving For College Channeled Into Fight About Storage Bins
LEXINGTON, MA — Impatiently scanning store shelves while tersely repeating requests for an inventory of clothing and other items that would be taken along, local mother Susan Vernon, 51, channeled her escalating fears regarding her daughter leaving for college later this month into a fight about storage bins, sources reported Saturday. The argument, which first flared up 10 minutes earlier in the lamps and lighting section of a local Target retail location before beginning in earnest in the home storage containers and organizers aisle, reportedly served as a convenient proxy for the elder Vernon's growing anxieties about her daughter, Molly, 18, leaving home in just two short weeks to attend the University of Vermont. "Molly, we need to figure this out right now," said a visibly agitated Vernon, who, unable to reconcile the memory of holding her beautiful newborn daughter in her arms for the first time with the fact that Molly would soon be moving more than 200 miles away, instead brandished a Room Essentials 41-quart storage bin at her child. "Did you even bother to find out how much space you'll have in your closets at the dorm? Should we get these ones, or the bigger size?" "Look, I'm not going to be there to do everything for you," Vernon added while still waving around the $7.99 plastic container, coming as close as she would to revealing her deep, unbearable sadness over soon being separated, both emotionally and physically, from the person she loved most in the world. Overwhelmed by recollections of watching her daughter learn to back-dive off a floating dock during a summer trip to the Berkshires 11 years prior and her immense pride at having witnessed Molly play the role of Dorothy in a seventh-grade production of The Wizard Of Oz, sources said Vernon subconsciously prevented herself from bursting into tears by harshly chastising the rising freshman for initially selecting colored bins, insisting that Molly get clear bins so she could find what she was looking for without opening everything up and making a mess. "Do these have locks? Shouldn't they have locks?" Vernon said while inspecting a bin's closure mechanism, her voice becoming clipped and severe as a result of her panic over soon not being able to fulfill her duty of protecting and consoling her beloved daughter during times of emotional distress. Vernon was then said to have escalated the argument into a bitter nine-minute-long back-and-forth over the relative durability and affordability of the available storage options, creating a more psychologically tolerable conduit for the unmanageable thoughts of her soon-to-be-diminished role in her daughter's life, wherein Vernon — currently Molly's closest confidant — would be relegated to fielding the occasional phone call or text message. "We're only making this trip once, so if you want to just get a bunch of cheap garbage that's going to fall apart in six months, that's up to you," Vernon said in an effort to quell a hopelessness and despair she had never before experienced as she was struck by a deluge of memories of her daughter coming to her in tears due to skinned knees, nightmares, and the mean behavior of her peers, all of which Vernon had lovingly tended to. "Just don't come crying to me." After Molly made the argument for a set of more tasteful wicker-and-cloth bins that she contended could potentially serve her beyond college when she got her first apartment — a concept so terrifying to Vernon that she was momentarily rendered incapable of rational thought — Vernon reportedly reached out to her daughter, looking as though she might embrace Molly and tell her how much she loved her, but instead grabbed the bins from her daughter's hands and slammed them back onto the shelf. "I can't even deal with you right now," Vernon said as she struggled to somehow preserve those last few precious moments with her daughter before their relationship changed forever. "At the rate we're going, we won't even get to the bedding aisle before the store closes." At press time, sources reported that Molly was channeling her overpowering fears about soon being on her own and without her mother's unwavering support into petulantly sulking in the electronics section.

New Gym Member Lingers By Free Weights For Several Seconds Before Returning To Elliptical Machine
EAGAN, MN — After tentatively approaching the extensive rack of dumbbells located along the gym's wall, new Bally Total Fitness member Brian Vinje was seen lingering in the vicinity of the free weights for several seconds Thursday before returning to the elliptical machine on which he had previously been exercising, onlookers reported. According to accounts, Vinje took roughly eight seconds to peruse the wide selection of weights, lightly touching the grip of a 20-pound dumbbell for a moment, before retreating a short distance and briefly pretending to become occupied by a poster of human musculature on the wall. While reportedly pausing to cast a furtive glance around the room, Vinje is said to have made fleeting eye contact with another gym-goer seated on a nearby bench, causing him, by all accounts, to abruptly jerk his gaze back to the rack and to scan it as if searching for a specific desired weight. At press time, Vinje was seen with his eyes focused downward as he once again engaged the default settings on the elliptical trainer.

Conversational Lamprey Slowly Draining Life From Dinner Party
LANCASTER, PA — Explaining how their once-active discussion barely had the strength to continue on, sources confirmed Thursday that conversational lamprey Brian Kenney was slowly draining the life from acquaintance Josh Carrington's dinner party. According to sources, Kenney firmly latched himself onto each of the night's talking points and refused to let go until he sucked every ounce of energy from them, ultimately leaving each one too weakened and feeble to keep going. Despite their best efforts to shake off the conversational parasite and maintain a healthy discourse, guests confirmed that as soon as Kenney opened his mouth and dug into a topic, its vitality began quickly fading away, and it was only a matter of time before it wound up depleted and dead. After sapping the last bit of life from the dinner party, Kenney was reportedly seen trying to attach himself to a female guest in a desperate attempt to spawn.

College Freshman From Florida Has Never Seen People Complain About Snow For 5 Months Before
ITHACA, NY — Marveling at how different winter is in the Northeast compared to her hometown in Florida, Ithaca College freshman Emilie Sherman told reporters Tuesday that this was the very first time she had ever seen people complain about snow for five consecutive months. "Growing up in Sarasota, of course there was never any incessant whining about snow, so I was completely amazed when I saw that first person go on and on for months on end about how annoying the snow was," said a visibly awestruck Sherman, adding that while she had previously heard how harsh and lengthy the complaints about winter could be in the northern U.S., the amount of ceaseless grumbling she's seen this year went far beyond anything she had ever imagined. "It's remarkable — I just can't believe the bitching continues this long every year. I'm still stunned every time I look around and see all of it." Despite her astonishment, Sherman said she couldn't wait to return home over break and get back to her more familiar year-round gripes about the heat and humidity.

Man Suddenly Regretting Asking To Be Taken Seriously By Peers
COLUMBIA, MO — Just two weeks after requesting candid feedback on his work and a greater voice in department meetings, local marketing strategist Daniel Farragut told reporters Monday that he is beginning to regret asking to be taken seriously by his peers. "I thought it would be helpful to hear a straightforward assessment of my job performance, but it turns out I was totally wrong," said Farragut, who since asking to be treated as an integral member of the team has received over a dozen pointed criticisms of his abilities, 30 brutally honest appraisals of his proposals' shortcomings, and a handful of sharp jabs at his general temperament. "I actually think I liked it better before, when everyone basically ignored me and called me out behind my back. It was so much easier to get through the day." At press time, Farragut had made a string of mistakes large enough for his colleagues to be able to once again go about condescending to him and dismissing all of his contributions outright.

Man Basks In Triumphant Glory After Purchases Line Up To Exact Value Of Gift Card
CANTON, MI — Upon being informed by the cashier that his assortment of purchases totaled $49.56, local man Josh Molina triumphantly basked Thursday in the glory of using up nearly the exact value of his $50 Target gift card. "Wow, I thought maybe that Twix bar would nudge me over the limit, but it worked out perfectly, just perfectly," said Molina, exulting in victory after spending 20 minutes carefully gathering a group of items that would approach $50 and that would then edge even closer to that amount once tax was factored in. "I figured the coffee machine would use up the bulk of my card, and then when I saw some socks I like on sale for $7.99, I just knew the numbers were going to line up. This is beyond amazing." At press time, Molina had reinserted the now-44-cent gift card into his wallet, where it would remain indefinitely.

Man Deftly Downplays His Neighborhood To Coworker Thinking Of Moving There
BOSTON — Thinking quickly to devise a list of reasons why the area was not an ideal choice, local billing clerk Tim Connors, 33, managed to skillfully downplay the desirability of his neighborhood to a coworker who expressed an interest in potentially moving there, sources confirmed Wednesday. "You know, it was pretty nice when I moved in a few years ago, but it's actually kind of gone downhill a bit," said Connor, who mentioned the neighborhood's lack of easy access to a grocery store as well as the long commute to work each morning as serious things to consider before his colleague started looking at apartments in the area. "Honestly, it's okay, if you don't mind limited restaurant choices and all the noisy construction. It's fine for me right now, but if I could afford to I would probably move somewhere else." Connors added that if his coworker wanted to explore the neighborhood, he should definitely check out the main square, which he noted had a great little coffee shop and "only a few muggings each month."

Siblings Quietly Relieved Oldest Brother Setting Bar So Low
CHARLOTTE, NC — Explaining how the 25-year-old's personal and academic shortcomings had made their relationship with their parents far easier, siblings Eric and Theresa Conrad confided to reporters Friday that they were quietly relieved their oldest brother, Dennis, was setting the bar so low. "Dennis barely had the grades to get into the local state college and then took six years to graduate, so as long as I get in anywhere and don't drop out, Mom and Dad should be completely fine with it," said Eric, 15, whose sister confirmed how much they appreciate Dennis taking the pressure off them by living way out near the airport in a basement studio apartment he can only afford because their parents help with the rent. "And considering how he's never in a relationship that lasts more than a few dates, Mom and Dad are going to be thrilled when I bring literally anyone home to meet them. Basically, all Theresa and I have to do is not be total fuckups and we're golden." Sources later reported that after receiving a text message from Dennis informing them he had been fired from his job at Walgreens, the two siblings immediately went downstairs to casually slip the information into a conversation with their parents.

Child's Description Of Heaven During Near-Death Experience Specifically Mentions Book Deal
NEW YORK — Speaking for the first time since waking from a medically induced coma following a devastating car accident, 8-year-old Aiden Miller recounted an extremely vivid near-death experience Friday that reportedly contained detailed descriptions of heaven, angels, and a six-figure book deal. "I was walking up in the clouds and met friends, and strangers, and all these famous people who talked with me about all kinds of things and brought up the possibility of selling the rights to my story to a big-name publisher," said the second-grader, who attested that during the five-minute period in which his heart had stopped on the operating table, he ascended to a shining, golden paradise where he says he met with the archangel Gabriel and a literary agent who has helped a number of authors secure multi-book deals with lucrative worldwide book tours. "Jesus was sitting at the right hand of God and my grandfather was right there, and they looked at me and smiled at each other and said I should ask for an $80,000 advance with 10 percent of back-end profits." Miller added that he felt a profound sense of peace and well-being when Jesus told him to go forth and seek a blockbuster deal for the movie rights.

Ungrateful Man Just Up And Dies After Everything Insurance Company Has Done For Him
HARTFORD, CT — After his health insurance provider selflessly paid dozens of claims, covered no fewer than five generic drug prescriptions, and fielded his near-daily phone calls, ungrateful policy member Samuel Clifton, 59, had the temerity to just up and die Monday without so much as a word of explanation, sources reported. "Unbelievable — we bend over backwards for this guy and he just goes and passes away," Aetna claims manager Gloria Reyman said while reviewing "the complete ingrate's" files, noting that her company had only aggressively disputed a handful of his claims over the past year. "Sure, he paid for the first $2,500, but then we covered a good chunk of his in-network costs. And after all the time we put in, mailing him the summaries of his treatments and hospital visits, this is how he thanks us? By dying, just like that?" Reyman added that the recently deceased Clifton at least had the common decency to provide Aetna with an emergency contact so the company could send next-of-kin information to several collection agencies.

GRAND JUNCTION, CO — Explaining that the adjustment made the most practical sense for all parties involved, local parents Beth and Ryan Morgan held a press conference Friday morning to announce the official transfer of expectations from their oldest child, Jeremy, to his younger sibling, Angie. "After a careful analysis of our prospective returns, we have opted to reassign all of our hopes and dreams for the future from our firstborn to our second child, effective as of 9 a.m. this morning," said Beth Morgan, who claimed that their 16-year-old son's inadequate progress in areas such as effective decision-making and academic achievement were the catalyst for his removal as the recipient of their emotional investment. "While we thank Jeremy for his years as the primary bearer of our expectations, in the long run we feel Angie is the right choice to attain professional success and relationship stability, give us grandchildren, and ultimately, provide us the parental satisfaction we have been looking for." The Morgans added that although they no longer retain any stake in Jeremy's future, he will be kept on for several years to serve as an example to Angie to deter any potential waste of resources.

Man Sadly Realizes Cramped One-Bedroom Apartment Has Enough Space To Host Party With All His Friends
CHICAGO — Sighing as he scanned the room and performed a mental tally of everyone he would invite, local 26-year-old Andrew Bryer sadly realized that his cramped one-bedroom apartment has enough space to host a party with all of his friends, sources confirmed Friday. "There's really nowhere to sit other than the futon and a couple of stools, but honestly that's probably plenty of seating for my college friends and my friends from work," said Bryer, adding that his narrow galley kitchen would provide "plenty" of additional square footage should he also invite a few neighbors from his apartment building or if some of his hometown friends were visiting. "I guess if all of them brought their friends it might get a bit crowded, but the little entryway area would still provide enough overflow room for everyone. Or I could just push the coffee table against the wall. Jeez, I could certainly host everybody, no problem." After checking his fridge, Bryer told reporters he would definitely have to get a second 12-pack before ever having the party.

SEATTLE — In an effort to ensure that none of his coworkers would be within earshot of his call, DocuSign employee David Olson reportedly retreated to a remote corner of the office Friday to complete a particularly disgusting food order. "I'll get that with bacon, extra mayo, and ranch dressing," said the 32-year-old account manager, who reportedly lowered his voice to a whisper while craning his neck to double-check that the coast was still clear. "Make sure to hold the lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Does it cost extra to swap the side salad for the chili cheese fries?" At press time, a hunched-over Olson was frantically devouring the food at his desk to prevent his coworkers from noticing the shameful meal.

"I'd kind of expected him to say a word or two by now, but I guess every dad is a little different," the 12-month-old reportedly thought to himself, adding that he had heard his father emit a number of grunts, fussy grumbles, and other nonverbal vocalizations, but nothing that approached coherent speech. "Every day, I'm hoping this will be the time he finally says something, but I'm trying not to fixate on that. If he still hasn't said anything by 18 months, though, I'm going to start worrying that something's wrong." The infant noted that he was also looking forward to the day when his father wasn't up all night screaming.

Woman Who Teaches Special-Needs Children Killing It At Dinner Party
WORCESTER, MA — Saying that her range of compelling anecdotes and personal insights had succeeded in captivating all who were present, sources confirmed Tuesday that middle school special-needs teacher Jennifer Ramirez is absolutely killing it at a local dinner party. "Jenny has such a fascinating job; when she went into her whole thing about the methods she uses to get through to her autistic students, we were all totally hooked," said fellow party attendee Eric Vaught just moments before Ramirez reportedly knocked it out of the park with a touching story about helping a particularly withdrawn student with his art project. "She's even been trying to shift the conversation to [fellow party attendee] Adam [Howard]'s rec basketball league, but then someone will ask her to explain how she ever manages such a uniquely challenging group of kids when they go on field trips and she'll go right on back to crushing it. She's firing on all cylinders right now." At press time, Ramirez had everyone in the room practically eating out of the palm of her hand by showing them photos of her students on her iPhone.

Annoying, Well-Adjusted Friend Even Fucking Meditating Now
LOWELL, MA — Noting how he piled on yet another healthy practice to his perfectly goddamned balanced lifestyle, exasperated friends confirmed Wednesday that annoying, well-adjusted 32-year-old Ryan Miller is even fucking meditating now. "Christ, the emotionally stable fucker already loves his job, exercises four times a week, and now he has the balls to spend 10 minutes every morning sitting quietly and breathing deeply to clear his mind," said longtime friend Michael Saunders, adding that it was bad enough when the irritatingly healthy Miller switched from drinking coffee to herbal tea. "Now, along with having great, fulfilling relationships with friends and family, Ryan's built time into his healthy lifestyle to further improve his fucking self-awareness and concentration. God, that even-tempered asshole claims it's really reducing his stress, too. Prick." At press time, Saunders told reporters that if his aggravating, good-natured friend posted one more sun salutation picture on Facebook, he would unfriend the man on the spot.

Otherwise Reasonable Man Sincerely Believes U.S. Landed On Moon
CLOVIS, NM — Describing him as a normal, well-adjusted individual in nearly every respect, acquaintances of 32-year-old Gary Morgan confirmed Monday that the otherwise reasonable man earnestly believes the U.S. government landed a spacecraft on the moon. "Gary's a pretty regular, levelheaded guy unless he gets going on one of his ridiculous rants about how American astronauts actually walked on the moon back in 1969," said friend Jeremy Lesser, adding that you would never guess by looking at Morgan that he's absolutely convinced NASA successfully sent six different crews on lunar missions. "Honestly, I've found it's best just to avoid the topic of space exploration altogether when we hang out. I've come to realize that no matter what I say, I'm never going to change his mind about the Apollo program. And I'd rather talk to him about anything else than hear him go off about astronauts exploring the lunar surface and bringing samples back to Earth again." At press time, Lesser was reportedly biting his tongue as Morgan explained the existence of several American flags allegedly planted on the moon.

Man Treats Mother To Detail About His Personal Life
ELKHART, IN — Saying that he likes to indulge her every once in a while, local man Wayne Timmons, 28, reportedly treated his mother to a small detail about his personal life during a phone conversation Thursday. "I was talking with my mom earlier, and I figured I'd make her day by sharing a single piece of private information that genuinely reflects something that's going on in my life," said Timmons, referring to a phone call in which he decided to give his mother a little thrill by briefly mentioning that he had recently met a woman at a colleague's party and that he was considering inviting her out on a date. "I even told her this girl's name before going back to flatly stating that work's going fine, and that just about put her on cloud nine. It had been a while since I actually offered her anything other than the most general descriptions of my life, so the way I see it, she'd earned a little peek into the things I actually think about and feel." After his spontaneous act of generosity reportedly elicited a series of probing follow-up questions into his recent dating prospects, Timmons decided that he would not be revealing any further non-superficial personal information to his mother for a minimum of six months.

Grandson's Jigsaw Puzzle Strategy Fucking Pathetic
SCOTTSDALE, AZ — Calling the 7-year-old's attempt at fitting together the pieces the most idiotic display he's witnessed in almost eight decades on earth, local grandfather Harold Randolph told reporters Wednesday that his grandson's jigsaw puzzle strategy is absolutely fucking pathetic. "Jesus Christ, how does this little moron not know to start with the corner pieces?" said Randolph, 78, adding that the child's decision to not immediately dump out all 100 pieces of the barnyard animal–themed puzzle and inspect them against the box's cover "completely retarded." "Oh, great, now this dipshit is trying to jam that grass piece into where the horses should be. I almost wish I could slap him in the face so he'd realize what a jackass he's making of himself, but maybe he's just a lost cause." At press time, Randolph was giving his imbecile grandson 10 more seconds before pushing him out of the way and just solving the puzzle himself.

Man Needs Emotional Support Only A Woman Can Feign
MINNEAPOLIS — Saying that an insincere feminine touch would do him a world of good, sources confirmed Monday that local man Jeff Cooper needs the type of emotional support only a woman can feign. "I've tried to be there to manufacture support and understanding for Jeff, but there's only so much sympathy a regular friend can fake — he needs the convincing facade of tenderness and compassion of someone special," said the 44-year-old's longtime friend Peter Shaw, adding that, while he is always there to pretend to listen to Cooper, it simply isn't the same as a woman's fabricated affection. "He could really use the plausible facsimile of care and understanding of a woman to help get him back up on his feet. I think it would really pick him up." Shaw added that seeing his friend in such a state makes him all the more thankful for the illusion of warmth and love he goes home to every night.

Motorcyclist Salvaged For Parts
SIOUX FALLS, SD — Following a multiple-vehicle accident on Interstate 90 that temporarily halted traffic in both directions, sources reported Friday that a motorcyclist involved in the crash was hauled off and salvaged for parts. "That motorcyclist looked like a total loss when they brought it in here, but we were surprised by how many usable parts we were able to save," said Donald Hill, who led the salvage efforts, adding that despite extensive damage to its exterior and a pair of entirely demolished kidneys, he and his team managed to reclaim a couple decent lungs and a cornea that still worked "like a charm." "The wreck really mangled that biker, but we might be able to fix that leaky heart valve and get some good use out of it. Unfortunately, the rest is so scraped up and damaged that all we can do is cart it out to the yard with all the other completely totaled ones." At press time, Hill was baffled by how the motorcyclist had even managed to drive around with a liver in such bad shape.

Scout Returns With News Of Quicker Checkout Line To The East
SALINAS, CA — After venturing forth into the vast, unexplored territory beyond the battery display, a scout is said to have returned from the farthest reaches of the Safeway cashier lanes with word of a quicker checkout line to the east, sources confirmed Wednesday. "Lane two's open," said the intrepid voyager, informing his party of fairer conditions past the self-checkout stations that would allow them to circumvent a phalanx of loaded carts and proceed with great haste to the parking lot. "There's only one guy in line, and he doesn't have much." At press time, the grocery expedition was forced to turn back after coming upon a dark, foreboding proclamation that granted passage only to those carrying 10 items or fewer.

HR Director Reminds Employees That Any Crying Done At Office Must Be Work-Related
DECKERVILLE, MI — In an effort to ensure employees stay focused during business hours, Paragon Media human resources director Patty Clemence sent a company-wide email Tuesday reiterating that any crying done at the office must be work-related, sources confirmed. "All personal crying, such as that stemming from household finances or fights with your spouse, should either be taken care of before you arrive at work in the morning or be put off until after 5 p.m.," said Clemence, asking that workers limit openly weeping at their desk or in a bathroom stall to job-oriented topics such as benefits, their workload, or a lack of appreciation among colleagues. "Of course, there are some exceptions to these guidelines. For example, if you happen to be crying because work has prevented you from seeing your family this week, that's a gray area, and you might want to clear it with a supervisor before breaking down completely." Clemence added that anyone with additional concerns about this rule should feel free to come to her and quietly bawl in her office.

Returning Parents Can Tell Son Had Huge House Fire Over Weekend
VERONA, WI — Despite his best efforts to conceal the damage, area teen Kyle Towser confirmed Wednesday that his parents could clearly tell he had a huge house fire while they were away for the weekend. "I tried to cover it up before they came home by throwing blankets over the worst scorches on the floor and couches, but they could definitely smell smoke on me as soon as they came through the door," said Towser, adding that what began as a small house fire soon got completely out of control and kept on going until well after 4 a.m. "I mean, of course they were going to find out: The den, kitchen, and master bedroom are totally destroyed. Plus, the neighbors complained when it really started raging." Towser went on to say that his parents were surprisingly understanding since they had house fires when they were kids, too.

Mathematical Skill Downplayed To Get Out Of Splitting Check
SAN JOSE, CA — Fearing that he would otherwise be stuck sorting through his friends' wad of bills and credit cards, sources confirmed Thursday night that local man Derek Mixon downplayed his mathematical abilities to avoid the task of calculating how to split that evening's dinner check. "Oh, I've never been good at this stuff," said the college graduate, who, despite reportedly having a firm understanding of the basic principles of arithmetic, suggested to those around him that he was unqualified to factor in tax and tip and tabulate what each individual needed to contribute to the bill. "Somebody else should do it. I don't want to mess it up." Sources confirmed that, after being told how much he owed, Mixon abandoned the facade of mathematical incompetence and reminded everyone at the table that he should pay $4 less as he did not eat any of the appetizers.

Helpful Waitress Asks Recently Seated Couple If They've Eaten Food Before
MICHIGAN CITY, IN — Having greeted the table and handed out the restaurant's menu, City Bistro waitress Amanda Meese helpfully inquired Tuesday if a recently seated couple had ever eaten food before, sources confirmed. "You folks ever put food in your mouth, chewed it for a few seconds with your teeth, and then swallowed it?" Meese asked, thoughtfully guiding the diners through the process of employing their lips, tongue, and jaws in unison to break down edible material in preparation for entry to the stomach. "Cutting your meal into smaller pieces with a knife and fork is really popular, but be sure you're not actually eating the knife and fork. Just let me know if you have any questions, okay?" Reports indicate the customers had largely tuned out the waitress's explanation of eating and, at press time, were smearing appetizers all over their shirts and pants.

Burger King Franchise Owner Adds Sad Little Personal Touches To Restaurant
TOMAH, WI — Noting that several old black-and-white photographs of the local area were hung on the walls and a Viterbo University "V-Hawks" basketball schedule was posted near the entrance, sources confirmed Tuesday that local Burger King franchise operator Scott Hamlin has added his own depressing little personal touches throughout the restaurant. "I want customers to have a good time here, so I put up a few things here and there to liven it up," said Hamlin, who is said to have heartbreakingly attempted to distinguish store #2132 from other franchise locations by hanging a Fort McCoy "Go Army" towel behind the register. "We're a part of this community, and I think the locals who come in deserve something a little more special than a regular fast food place. This isn't just any old Burger King — it's their Burger King." At press time, Hamlin had received instructions from his regional franchise coordinator ordering him to replace the photo of the local Little League team he sponsors with a poster advertising the return of the Yumbo Hot Ham & Cheese Sandwich.

Dirty Slush Machine Provides Children In Florida Taste Of Winter
FORT LAUDERDALE, FL — Smiling as their children played among the mounds of gray, icy slop, local parents told reporters Tuesday that a dirty slush machine had successfully provided their families with a small taste of winter in Florida. "I was raised in a city up north, so we had this all the time, but my 6-year-old daughter took her first sled ride on a hill of filthy mush not even 10 minutes from our house," said Karen Rosen, who told reporters she was impressed at how the diesel-powered blower had fully transformed a patch of asphalt outside Coral Ridge Mall into a grimy sludge winterland. "Getting to watch my child do a snow angel in a layer of freezing gunk, motor oil, and salt was a real treat for me." Rosen added that her only complaint was that the dirty slush had completely melted away into water and deicing chemicals before she and her daughter could build a snowman.

Man's Area Code Provides Exciting Glimpse At Past Life
SHULLSBURG, WI — Illuminating a previously unknown chapter of the man's past, an incoming call with a 617 area code provided an exciting glimpse into the life of 29-year-old Derek Eanesworth, acquaintances reported Tuesday. "Ooh, he must have lived in Boston for a while, but when and where, exactly?" said the call's recipient, Anne McDermott, her mind reportedly racing with possibilities about Eanesworth's suddenly revealed connection to eastern Massachusetts. "Did he grow up there? Work there? Go to school there? Now, I'm curious what strange chain of events could have led him all the way here." When reached for comment, Eanesworth told reporters he had no idea where McDermott's own 225 area code came from, but figured it must be where she got that weird accent.

Woman Celebrates 4th Year Of Weaning Self Off Facebook
PITTSBURGH — Renewing her intention to cut back a little and only log onto the social network a few times a week at most, area woman Kathy Ward reportedly celebrated her fourth anniversary Tuesday of weaning herself off Facebook. "I realized that I just waste so much time on Facebook every single day, so from now on I'm going to really start limiting myself," the 31-year-old told reporters, restating a declaration she first made in early 2011 and has reiterated roughly every two weeks since. "If I can hold myself to only checking it on the weekends for a while, then eventually I can get down to one session a week, and at that point it'll be easy to just quit altogether. I don't even know who half my friends are anyway." At press time, Ward was on Facebook.

Receipt Brazenly Placed In Bag Without Permission
DAVENPORT, IA — Calling the conduct an affront to common decency, local Walgreens customer David Nivola confirmed that his receipt had been brazenly placed in his bag without his permission Wednesday. "Am I seeing things, or did you just put that receipt into my bag without even thinking to ask first?" said an incredulous Nivola, receiving vocal support from customers behind him in the checkout line who reportedly appeared equally stunned and offended by the cashier's audacity. "A man has a right to be asked for consent before you do something like that. Jesus, look at it in there right alongside my items. You're lucky I don't return all this stuff and walk right out the door." Nivola added he was amazed the cashier even had the common courtesy to ask if it was okay to place the items in one bag instead of two.

Personal Trainer Impressed By Man's Improved Excuses
SAN JOSE, CA — Acknowledging that the progress made in such a short amount of time was remarkable, Club One Fitness personal trainer Logan Kaiser told reporters Tuesday he is very impressed by the improvement in both the strength and consistency of his client's excuses. "He's starting to come along; a few months ago he had really weak pretenses for not sticking to a workout plan, but he's put in a lot of effort and now he's sporting much more robust and powerful justifications," said Kaiser of 36-year-old software engineer Jeffrey McGann, noting that the gym member's exculpatory anecdotes had already tripled in size and were becoming far more difficult to verify. "After seeing how he struggled early on with a simple excuse about traffic, it's gratifying to see him push himself and dig deep for rationalizations that more believably exonerate him. And you can tell it's gotten a lot easier. His total commitment to tackling a long, grueling story about how construction in his neighborhood aggravated his dust mite allergies was outstanding." At press time, Kaiser expressed concern after learning that McGann would be unable to make it to the gym due to an unspecified workplace emergency.

Area Man Only One With Problems
BOSTON — Expressing the sadness they feel for the beleaguered man and his incomprehensible plight, friends, family, and acquaintances of area man Doug Belson confirmed Wednesday that he is the only person in the world who has problems. Reports indicate the 34-year-old account manager, who has suffered from this unique affliction for most of his life, is entirely alone in experiencing such phenomena, which from time to time cause him to be unhappy and prevent his life from going as smoothly as he would like. "It's hard to understand, but for some reason things don't go Doug's way 100 percent of the time. It's just so tragic," said coworker Elizabeth Waite, explaining that she, like everyone on earth aside from Belson, has never encountered an unexpected situation that interfered with her pursuit of a desired outcome. "And it's not just that he's had one or two of these problems. He's had quite a few. Like the other day he was stuck in traffic and had to just sit there, trapped, even though he had someplace he needed to be. Can you imagine what that must have felt like?" "And to think it was only a few months ago that his car actually broke down, without any kind of warning, and he had to have it repaired," she continued. "I don't even know what to say to a person who's been through something like that." According to people familiar with Belson's personal trials, in just the past week the problems he — and he alone — has faced include having to drag himself out of bed for work even though he hadn't slept all that well, feeling trapped in a tedious and unchallenging job, and enduring a sense of loneliness while watching television by himself in his apartment — all awful experiences that Belson's acquaintances said they struggled to even fathom. While conveying a desire to support the hapless man through his debilitating predicaments, concerned sources said that because none of them had ever been afflicted with a seasonal cold, felt occasional fatigue at work, suffered a romantic rejection, or become uncomfortably hungry, it was hard to do anything more than express their profound sorrow for his baffling circumstances and offer whatever consoling words they could. "It's hard to believe that things actually arise in the course of his life that impede his plans, making his day more difficult. I don't know how anyone can deal with that." "Last week, I saw Doug using the office printer, and it was actually malfunctioning on him right before a meeting — it took me a while to even figure out what was going on, because I had no idea something like that could happen," said Peter Banks, Belson's supervisor at work. "After that, I thought, 'My God, this poor man. Look at this obstacle in his way he has to overcome. How terrible.' Ever since, I've been stopping by his desk just to pat him on the back and ask if there's anything I can do to help him out." "It's hard to believe that things actually arise in the course of his life that impede his plans, making his day more difficult," Banks added. "I don't know how anyone can deal with that." One friend told reporters she was deeply shaken after Belson mentioned he was having trouble with his landlord and then, an entire week later, told her the matter had yet to be resolved. While many of Belson's problems reportedly go away by themselves or are rendered moot by the passage of time, sources explained that some apparently have to be actively solved. Indeed, several visibly aghast acquaintances confirmed that certain hindrances in Belson's life can persist for months or even years, as has been the case with his chronic lower-back pain and his emotionally distant relationship with his father. In addition, those close to Belson said they were left staggered after discovering he is sometimes beset by multiple problems at the same time, making him the sole individual in existence who in a single day has to contend with such issues as making a student loan payment on time, the inconvenience of a long line at his favorite lunch place, and anxiety over whether he drinks too much. "It's amazing Doug still finds the strength to carry on even though things sometimes don't work out exactly the way he intends," said college friend Greg Yang, adding that conversations with Belson always make him feel extremely fortunate that he never has to worry about encountering an impediment in any aspect of his own existence. "Whenever he calls me up to talk about how stressed out he is, I just try to be a good listener, while keeping in mind that I'll never truly understand how hard it is for him. How could I, you know?" "Really, when you consider everything he has to go through, it's incredible he only complains to everybody around him a few dozen times a day," he added.

Woman Transitions From Being Terrified Of Getting Pregnant To Being Terrified She Can't Get Pregnant
BETHLEHEM, PA — Acknowledging that she once considered conceiving a child to be the greatest threat to her future, local woman Rebecca Davis confirmed Wednesday that she has transitioned from being terrified of getting pregnant to being terrified she can't get pregnant. "I'm just really scared that it may never happen at this point," said the 34-year-old woman who has closed the chapter of her adult life when the sight of a negative pregnancy test brought on a wave of pure relief and is now consumed by anxiety that she may never see a blue plus sign. "All we can do is keep trying." At press time, a desperate Davis was reportedly picking up fertility medication from the same pharmacy where she had once frantically purchased Plan B.

Man Uses Weekend To Make Totally Different Mistakes Than He Did During Workweek
SPOKANE, WA — Grateful to have a couple of days free from his job responsibilities, sales representative Sam Roslindale told reporters Friday that he likes to use his weekends to make entirely different mistakes than he does during the workweek. "I spend so many hours at the office making professional errors that it's nice to have a little time to ruin my personal life," said Roslindale, adding that after five days in a row of alienating coworkers and falling well short of sales goals, he appreciated having 48 solid hours to just focus on damaging his relationships with family and friends. "I need that Saturday and Sunday to drink too much, yell at my wife for no reason, and let my daughter down. Then, come Monday, I'll be ready to resume destroying my career all over again." Roslindale went on to say that while he was glad to have the weekend, he would love to take a long vacation to really screw things up.

Man Only Has Himself To Blame For What's In Targeted Banner Ad
ITHACA, NY — Acknowledging that he must accept the consequences of his actions, local 37-year-old Christopher McGwire told reporters Monday that he has no one else to blame but himself for the targeted pool toy advertisements that have been regularly appearing in his browser window over the past two weeks. "As annoying and invasive as these banner ads are, I have to admit that I'm the one who looked at a few inflatable inner tubes a few weekends back," said McGwire, who first began to see the swim-related banner ads after aimlessly browsing the selection of dive sticks and floating ride-on toys at the online store of a pool supplies retailer last month. "Honestly, I can't say that I didn't sort of ask to see pictures of pool noodles, swim floaties, and light-up beach balls every time I go online. It's my own fault, really, and I just have to deal with it." McGwire, who confirmed that he often clicks on untrustworthy links, admitted that he probably deserves to deal with his laptop's slow computer speed as well.

Whitewater Rafting Trip In Which Friend Drowned Still Pretty Fun
GLENWOOD SPRINGS, CO — With the sole exception of the death of a close friend, a recent whitewater rafting excursion was deemed a rousing success by the group's five surviving members, sources confirmed Tuesday. "Except for Daryl falling out and drowning, this trip was a total blast," said Justin Purley at the conclusion of an exhilarating day of paddling through canyons, navigating Class IV rapids, recovering their friend's body from the river, and taking photographs of the scenic landscape. "That moment when he bounced out of the raft and smashed his head on the rocks was just about the only time the smile left my face the whole trip. Plus, we saw that eagle!" Purley added that the group would always remember Daryl, as well as the cool old arrowhead they found on the riverbank.

Man Announces Plan To Take Out Anger On First Less Powerful Person He Sees
WILLINGBORO, NJ — Telling reporters that he was seething and required an outlet for his rage, local insurance salesman Sean Godere confirmed Monday that he plans on taking out his anger on the first less powerful person he encounters. "I'm going to absolutely unload on the next person who crosses my path, provided they don't have as high a social or professional standing as I do," said Godere, who noted that it was unlikely he would bump into an intern at his office this afternoon and thus intended to head to either a grocery store or coffee shop, places he believes offer a high probability of interacting with a low-level service worker who could absorb the heated release of his temper. "As soon as I run into somebody who is several rungs below me in the socioeconomic hierarchy and who therefore has effectively no available means of holding me to account for my behavior, I'm going to snap." Godere added that, should he fail to find a proper target before the end of the workday, the four members of his family he will see later this evening all meet his criteria.

Everyone In Family Compliments Grandmother On How Small And Feeble She's Gotten
WHEATON, IL — Uttering surprised exclamations and smiling in amazement at her wrinkled, wizened frame shortly after she arrived for the Thanksgiving holiday, every member of the Hostig family complimented their grandmother, Judith Hostig, on how small and feeble she has gotten, sources confirmed Wednesday. "Oh, my goodness, you're so much more frail and withered than when I last saw you!" said granddaughter Elise Hostig, adding that she could remember the days when the 83-year-old was still a vibrant, robust woman whose sallow skin didn't even sag off of her body. "Gosh, it's like you shrank into this shriveled little person overnight. Before we know it, you'll be a tiny, hunched-over mound!" Sources confirmed that family members then made the octogenarian stand back-to-back with her 7-year old grandson for a comparison.

Conversations Pretty Limited When Friend Not In Midst Of Crisis
RACINE, WI — Though she considers herself a close and loyal confidante, 28-year-old Amanda Willets admitted Tuesday that unless her longtime friend Courtney Saunders, 29, is in the throes of panic, heartbreak, or a physical illness, the two have very little to discuss. "We can easily talk for hours about a disagreement between her and her mother, or the veiled insults she thinks are directed at her by a colleague, but as soon as things start looking up in her life we kind of hit a wall," Willets said, referring to the halting and uninteresting conversations the two engage in once Saunders' various health scares, family dramas, financial emergencies, and existential crises have been exhausted. "Yesterday, for instance, things seemed to be going pretty well for her, so we awkwardly chatted about Orange Is The New Black for a few minutes and then just found an excuse to get off the phone. It's uncomfortable right now, but knowing Courtney, it won't be long before she completely freaks out about how her landlord is raising her rent or how another one of her high school friends got engaged while she's still alone, and our talks will pick up again." At press time, Willets breathed a sigh of relief and cleared her afternoon schedule after receiving a text from Saunders saying "sooo annoyed, please call."

Man Unaware All His Friends Think Of Him When They Want To Put Things Into Perspective
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ — Friends and coworkers of local man Alan Tessler confirmed Wednesday that whenever they feel discouraged or depressed, they need only think of their 36-year-old acquaintance to put everything back into perspective, a fact to which Tessler, by all accounts, remains completely oblivious. According to sources, Tessler is unaware that each of his friends bring him to mind when facing personal obstacles, relationship troubles, or a general sense of dissatisfaction with their lives, using the unmarried office equipment sales associate as a valuable reminder that they should be grateful for what they have. "If I have a rough day at work, or my wife and I get into a fight, I can always take a step back and be thankful that I'm not in Alan's shoes," longtime friend Daniel Carranza said of Tessler, who reportedly lives by himself, eats the same Chinese takeout meal most nights, and spends his weekends watching reality television competitions, and who furthermore has no idea whatsoever that his living situation is often used for therapeutic purposes by his closest companions. "It really helps put my problems in context. All I have to do is invite him out to lunch and listen to him talk about his bad back or this new real estate investment idea he read about online, and I realize that I'm actually in pretty good shape." "Just thinking about Alan helps me remember how truly lucky I am," Carranza continued. As verified by multiple sources, with his dead-end career, lack of personal interests, and the frequency with which he still borrows his parents' car, Tessler has for numerous years unknowingly enhanced the self-esteem of almost everyone who knows him. Indeed, Tessler's acquaintances claimed that frustrations and anxieties concerning their own financial woes, health issues, and other difficulties invariably melt away simply by picturing Tessler sitting alone in his unadorned one-bedroom apartment or going grocery shopping on a Friday evening. Specifically, Tessler — who fails to notice the knowing looks passed among his group of friends whenever he relays to them his latest setbacks — reportedly serves as a source of inspiration for dozens of acquaintances, all of whom favorably contrast their own struggles against his every time they receive one of his Facebook invitations to play Mafia Wars. Several of Tessler's family members also claim they have benefited from comparing themselves to the aimless man, with relatives saying that stilted exchanges with the knee-brace-wearing perpetual bachelor during holiday get-togethers leave them feeling more secure in the knowledge that, all things considered, their lives could be far worse. In addition, many individuals who know Tessler only tangentially confided to reporters that spending just a few minutes in the oblivious man's company allows them to gain a greater appreciation for their own circumstances. "I've had days where I feel just about ready to give up, but all it takes to get out of my funk is for Alan to show up here at the coffee shop, order his usual double-caramel latte, and spend an hour by himself in the corner looking at OKCupid profiles, and I feel a lot better about myself," said local barista Carolyn Shelby, 25, who explained that taking a few seconds to consider Tessler's day-to-day existence has helped her surmount dozens of periods of despondency and self-doubt. "I've got a boyfriend who loves me, goals that motivate me to improve my place in the world, and my whole life ahead of me. If I put all that next to what Alan is going through, I'm always reminded that I've actually got it pretty good." When reached for comment, Tessler told reporters that while he's endured his share of difficulties in recent years, he appreciates having so many people in his social circle who take an active interest in his life. "My friends are really amazing; they make a big effort to keep in touch," said the man who has no idea that his personal faults and failings arise in conversation during any social gathering where he is not present. "I usually get a call or email from one of them at least once a week, and they're always really interested to hear me talk about my new fish tank or my fantasy baseball league. I can talk about whatever's going on in my life with them, which is great." "It's nice to have so many people who really care about me," he added.

Magical Office Worker Able To Turn Everything He Touches Into More Work For Colleagues
BLOOMINGTON, MN — Noting that his mystical abilities extend from the most everyday tasks to the largest quarterly projects, coworkers at Oracle Media reported Monday that enchanted office worker Matthew Kosnick is capable of turning everything he touches into additional work for his colleagues. "His powers are astonishing; every responsibility that is left in his hands — from compiling the company's sales figures, to putting together PowerPoints, to refilling the coffeemaker — magically becomes hours of extra work for someone else to complete," said junior sales representative Alicia McCall, marveling at Kosnick's supernatural ability to instantly increase the hassle of any project tenfold. "There is no assignment he can't turn into a weeklong slog that results in multiple conference calls and forces his fellow employees to stay late several nights in a row. And with just a few quick lines in an email, he is able to set off a miraculous chain of events that eventually takes up all of the department's time and effort. It's breathtaking." At press time, the magical employee could be overheard remarking how busy his coworkers appeared and asking if there was anything he could do to help.

Leaving Dorm Room Door Open To Play Large Role In Freshman's Social Strategy
GREENCASTLE, IN — Anticipating that it will serve as a springboard for the formation of new friendships, DePauw University freshman Andrew Russett said Tuesday that leaving his dorm room door open will be a central component of his social strategy. Russett, 18, told reporters that a door left casually ajar will be a clear signal to other students on his floor that the room's occupant is both welcoming and easygoing. "Everyone's trying to meet people during the first week of school, and when they see my door open, they'll probably want to poke their head in and see what's up," Russett said, adding that propping the door open about halfway would give people a glimpse of only about half his room, leaving them intrigued enough to find out more. "You have to stand out, and my open door is definitely going to get that done." "And even if people don't introduce themselves right away, as long as they see me through the door a few times, then they'll remember me as the laid-back guy who keeps his door open when they bump into me in the hallway," Russett added. Russett told reporters that he plans to strategically place items such as a mini-basketball hoop and an Xbox One with four controllers in view of the open portion of the door as a means of subtly conveying the room's fun atmosphere. To further communicate the idea that the room belongs to a cool person who might make a good friend, Russett said he will hang eye-catching posters for films The Big Lebowski and Wet Hot American Summer in such a way that they can easily be seen through the open door and noted that he will also turn his speakers toward the door so that passersby can better hear his music, primarily "regular rock songs and hip-hop stuff everyone likes." Additionally, Russett said he intends to affix a small whiteboard to the outside of his door with the words "Casa de Andrew" written on it with a dry-erase marker. "Obviously, I'm going to be meeting people in a lot of ways, but the door is crucial," Russett said, adding that he was likely to prop the door open with a flip-flop to further emphasize his relaxed nature. "I won't get invited to any parties if my door's closed. And if enough people stop by my room, it may become kind of the hangout place on the floor. Then I might not even have to have my door open at all for people to come around." "But I'm gonna stick with the open door for a while," Russett quickly added. At press time, Russett's strategy was apparently paying off, as sources confirmed that his RA had stopped by and encouraged him to come out of his room.

Laid-Back Company Allows Employees To Work From Home After 6 P.M.
GRESHAM, OR — Underscoring the benefits of working for a laid-back company like SocialFire Marketing, founder and CEO Matt Avalon told reporters Tuesday he had instituted an office-wide policy permitting employees to work from home anytime after 6 p.m. "If it helps them be efficient and get more done, I have no problem with people working remotely once they've left the office for the day," said Avalon, who noted that as long as they're doing their jobs, the location where his staff members choose to work between 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. is "completely up to them." "That's the kind of relaxed culture we strive to create here — one where you can even be working from your living room couch at two in the morning if you'd like." Avalon added that since they don't have to be in the office for any meetings, employees are free to work from home on weekends and holidays as well.

Aisle Of Hispanic Food Items All Man Needs To Know About Fate Of Country
MADEIRA, OH — Shaking his head at the diverse variety of Mexican and Latin American food options being made available to him, area shopper Steve Unger told reporters Friday that the Hispanic food aisle at his local grocery store pretty much told him all he needed to know about where America is heading. "Black beans, tortillas, hot peppers — boy, that's the whole story right here," said the visibly dismayed Unger, 49, who recalled a time when Latin American items only constituted about a third of Aisle 14's offerings at the Kroger on Miami Avenue and America's dominant position in the world was completely unquestioned. "Look at these names: Goya, Tapatio — it's the whole damn aisle! How many types of salsa do you need, for crying out loud?" At press time, Unger's ire had only grown more intense upon passing by a small refrigerated hummus display.

Man Trying To Enter Conversation Spends Few Minutes Smiling And Nodding At Edge Of Circle
BLOOMINGTON, IN — Having found himself without others to interact with at a house party Wednesday, guest Ben Weaver reportedly attempted to enter a conversation by spending a few minutes just smiling and nodding at the edge of a circle of people. "Uh-huh," said Weaver after gently nudging himself into a small gap between two members of the group and patiently making eye contact with each person who spoke in hopes of being drawn into the discussion. "Yeah, yeah." After he went largely ignored, sources confirmed Weaver quietly backed away from the group and repeated the process with three other clusters of partygoers before going home.

Pueblo Indians Can't Keep Pace With Area Mom's Appetite For Earthenware
ALBUQUERQUE, NM — Claiming that the 56-year-old's desire for authentic Native American ceramics is insatiable, local Pueblo artisans confirmed Wednesday that they can't keep pace with area mother Shelly Burke's ravenous appetite for earthenware. "She's just relentless — my entire inventory is down to pretty much nothing. How many bowls does this woman need?" said Sandia tribe pottery maker Teresa Otero, insisting that there simply aren't enough hours in the day to handcraft the number of clay pots necessary to satisfy the mother of three's inexhaustible cravings. "She shows up several times a week, sees the pottery, says it's adorable, and snaps up every piece we've got. It was one thing when she was just putting them in her living room, but now that she's giving them away as gifts, we're spread way too thin. Honestly, I haven't seen my family in a week." At press time, Otero reflexively tensed up as a visibly delighted Burke approached a table filled with ceramic storyteller dolls.

Man Visiting Hometown Amazed To Find All His Childhood Insecurities Still There
MANSFIELD, OH — While walking through his old neighborhood, Mansfield, OH, native Peter Grogan, 37, was reportedly surprised Thursday to find that each and every one of his childhood insecurities remains in his hometown. "I was heading down Marion Avenue, where Jeff Bilderman used to pick on me every day, and noticed that my old anxieties, fears, and constant sense of shame are all still here," Grogan told reporters, marveling that the dozens of uncertainties that plagued him throughout his adolescent and teenage years were still thriving exactly where he left them. "I haven't been back for long, but it doesn't seem like my timidity and self-doubt have changed even a bit. And it looks like my feelings of inadequacy are still going strong, judging by the fears of rejection that came flooding back when I walked past my old high school. It's all exactly the same as it was almost 20 years ago." Grogan added that the one difference he could identify was that walking through his hometown now fills him with newly established insecurities regarding his financial situation, relationship with his parents, and own impending mortality.

Mother Ferries 4 More Shirt Options Back To Son In Gap Dressing Room
COLONIE, NY — Ensuring that her latest selections included a variety of sizes and styles, local mother Melissa Garlington ferried four more shirt options back to her 14-year-old son waiting in a local Gap dressing room this weekend, sources confirmed. "I got a medium and a large of each one because I wasn't sure which you'd be," said Garlington, who then reportedly stood outside the stall as her son periodically cracked the door open to pass back the options he did not want. "I also got you a navy polo, but then I thought you'd look handsome in this nice green one, so try them both on. What about the shorts I brought back earlier — did they feel too tight around the waist? Make sure to sit down in them too." After confirming which options her son wanted to buy, Garlington then reportedly instructed him to change back into his old clothes while she headed over to the register to get them a spot in line.

Missed Call From Dad At 9 A.M. Strikes Terror Into Area Man's Heart
HARRISBURG, PA — While checking his phone shortly after arriving at work today, local man Scott Teresi was reportedly gripped by a sudden sense of abject terror upon noticing he had missed a call from his father at 9:09 a.m. "Oh, God," said the petrified 31-year-old, who is said to have immediately and involuntarily started imagining numerous unpleasant scenarios that might have prompted his father's attempted communication at such an hour on a weekday, ranging from a sudden downturn in his grandmother's health, to an accident involving his mother, to the dissolution of his parents' marriage, to some unforeseen, chilling admission from his father that he could not even begin to envision. "He knows I'm at work, but he still decided to call? This is definitely not going to be good. Fuck." At press time, Teresi was staring at his father's 26-second voicemail, trying to work up the nerve to press play.

Responsible Man Sets Aside Small Portion Of Every Paycheck For Bank To Gamble With
EDISON, NJ — Noting that it was the sensible thing to do at this point in his life, 27-year-old web designer Jonathan Elridge confirmed Thursday that he puts aside a small percentage of each paycheck for his bank to gamble with. "It's really important to save money for the future, even if it's just a little bit each month," said Elridge, explaining that roughly $80 per pay period is automatically directed into a separate pool of funds that Bank of America proprietary traders use to continuously wage bets on complicated asset-backed securities and opaque financial derivatives with varying levels of risk. "I just want to make sure that over time, I slowly accumulate a significant amount of money that [some extremely well-compensated Wall Street speculators can indiscriminately throw around in what essentially amounts to a massive game of chance, for which they have zero accountability in any way, shape, or form]. Honestly, it's just common sense." While spending several minutes filing the paperwork necessary to increase his regular contributions to the fund, Elridge was reportedly unaware that his retirement savings had increased and decreased in value roughly 12,000 times.

Man Nothing But Lumbering Golem Of Rewards Cards
HENDERSON, NV — Aghast at the hulking, shapeless being that lurched toward the registers, cashiers at the local Green Valley Parkway's Walgreens confirmed Thursday that the soulless mass shambling down the aisle was nothing but a lumbering golem of rewards cards. "Do you have a Balance Rewards card with us, sir?" said cashier Matt Hershlag, 25, before scanning one of the loosely hanging cards that formed the body of the immense supernatural creature who, sources confirmed, was more plastic and barcodes than man. "Thanks. That'll be $8.49." At press time, the towering anthropomorphic heap of loyalty cards had paused to search his Sprite bottle purchase for a My Coke Rewards product code in hopes of winning a free six-pack.

After Careful Thought, Teen Applies To College Where Family Donated Building
CORAL GABLES, FL — Saying that she had given the decision considerable thought, local high school senior Katie Simmons told reporters Monday that she would be applying to Bristol College, a school where her family had donated funds for a new 50,000-square-foot library. "There are so many great choices out there, but I feel like I should at least consider Bristol," said the 17-year-old, noting that while she would like to go somewhere that has a strong academic reputation and a vibrant social scene, it couldn't hurt to apply to the institution where her family handed over the largest single gift in the school's history to construct a new state-of-the-art library and digital media center. "Bristol's a pretty good school, and I could definitely picture myself there, so I guess there's no harm in filling out the application, right?" Simmons added that she was keeping her options open by also applying to the school whose president plays golf with her dad once a month.

Cake Left Out In Break Room With No Instructions
MINNEAPOLIS — Leaving dozens of workers unsure as to whether they were permitted to consume the enticing dessert, sources at the offices of Highwood Insurance told reporters Wednesday that a cake had been left out in the break room without any instructions. Prominently placed in the center of the break room's kitchen table, the 11-by-15-inch cake reportedly lacked any sign or note explaining its presence. Employees confirmed the store-bought cake, the surface of which does not bear any message written in icing that might reveal whom or what it could be for, has remained completely untouched, with no pieces missing, since it was first discovered after lunch. "Is this cake for everybody?" asked junior sales representative Chris Walsh, 28, who, though tempted to start eating the dessert, reported that he was uncomfortable proceeding without any clear confirmation that he was free to do so. "They wouldn't just leave it out here like this if it weren't for people to eat, right? Still, I'd hate to be the first one to cut into it if it's not for all of us." "Maybe I'll swing by later," he continued. "It looks pretty good." Perplexed employees remarked that at no point did they receive an email from the office manager notifying them that there would be a cake in the kitchen to mark an occasion of some kind, as they typically do in the event of an office celebration. As a result, sources said, those who encountered the unmarked dessert could only speculate as to whether it might be an indication of a birthday, retirement, or possibly even an office baby shower. Noting that the cake is just sitting out in the open and that someone had already removed the clear plastic cover from the confection, observers concluded that the dessert must be intended for consumption before the end of the workday. Employees stated that the mystery had been heightened by the fact that a few plastic forks had been left out, but no paper plates or cutting utensils, which further frustrated attempts to discern whether people were simply meant to begin helping themselves. Reports also indicated that the cake definitely isn't big enough for the entire office. "This might just be for the sales team," said 43-year-old Tim DeSoto, noting that the department had recently met its third-quarter goals, but that, as an accountant, he may not be entitled to a slice. "I'm not really sure. I guess I could ask if anyone else knows what's going on, but my desk is close enough to the kitchen that I can probably just keep an eye on it and see what happens." "I don't want to miss out on cake," he added. Throughout the day, employees admitted to finding excuses to check on the status of the cake, often by going into the break room to refill their still half-full glasses of water or by striking up a conversation with someone whose cubicle has a clear line of sight to the dessert. According to reports, those revisiting the cake typically lingered near it for several minutes before leaving, later repeating the process at approximately half-hour intervals. "Surely they're not just going to leave it out here all afternoon," said IT manager Sarah Golin, 32, noting that in 90 percent of these cases, such as the loaf of banana bread brought in after Mother's Day or the entire pumpkin pie from the Monday after Thanksgiving, the food is up for grabs. "If it weren't meant for someone, it would still be in the fridge. It's definitely going to be eaten soon. Sometime today." "I want some," she continued. At press time, the sight of the company's IT technician walking down the hallway with a slice of cake had reportedly triggered a mass scramble toward the kitchen.

Man Honestly Thinks He's Going To Get To Bed Early
DANBURY, CT — Entertaining outlandish delusions of actually getting in a solid eight hours of sleep, 29-year-old Josh Briner is honestly under the impression that he will be going to bed early, sources confirmed Thursday. "I made sure I had no plans tonight so that I can just turn in at 10 and get some serious rest," said the poor, naive fool who despite having a laptop next to his bed, four different shows he needs to catch up on, and a proclivity for wasting hours at a time on social media sites is genuinely convinced that he will be asleep at a reasonable hour. "It'll be nice to wake up feeling refreshed for once." At press time, Briner reportedly said "fuck it," resumed watching Sherlock on Netflix, and vowed that tomorrow he'd definitely be in bed by 9.

Community A Wasteland Of Professional Athletes' Failed Side Businesses
FORT MYERS, FL — With shuttered windows, empty parking lots, and clearance sale banners dotting nearly every block, the community of Fort Myers, Florida has in recent years become a veritable wasteland of professional athletes' failed side businesses, sources confirmed Thursday. Residents told reporters that defunct enterprises, ranging from a closed seafood restaurant owned by retired Miami Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler to a padlocked batting cage complex once operated by former Cincinnati Reds outfielder Eric Davis, have come to dominate the city's commercial district. "Nowadays, you can't walk down the street without seeing a boarded-up nightclub, laundromat, or oil change place that doesn't represent some athlete's doomed investment," said local man Charlie Stinson, 42, listing off an array of unsuccessful establishments that included a hair salon owned by professional tennis star Monica Seles and a southern BBQ restaurant founded by Pittsburgh Steelers Hall of Fame fullback Franco Harris. "On this block alone, there are three different bars, all of them closed, and all of them started by members of the Showtime Lakers." "You'd think that James Worthy would have decided to invest his money elsewhere after seeing what happened to Mychal's and The Rambis Hole, but you get the feeling that these guys didn't really think any of this through," Stinson added. Residents confirmed that the city of 62,000 has in recent years seen the opening and rapid closing of dozens of athlete-run ventures, including coffee shops, sushi bars, and go-kart tracks, nearly all of which have been mismanaged or neglected by a variety of current and retired sports figures. Specifically, sources pointed to such insolvent establishments as The Punchline, a comedy club bankrolled by former world heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe; a real estate office launched by Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz; and three-time Pro Bowler Tiki Barber's tropical-themed watering hole, The Tiki Lounge. Officials from the chamber of commerce confirmed that none of the operations remained in business for longer than six months, and all have left behind unoccupied strip mall units throughout the greater Fort Myers area. "A community this size can't possibly support two men's clothing boutiques opened by both Shannon Sharpe and Sterling Sharpe," resident Eric McGill said. "And poor Dusty Baker, he spent so much on TV commercials and print flyers, but you knew that his pool supply dealership would never get off the ground around here." Though lamenting the demise of these and other enterprises, observers said that they were not particularly surprised to see these ventures fail, noting athletes' tendency to quickly lose interest in their fledgling projects and leave responsibility for the commercial undertakings in the hands of various relatives and associates with no business experience. "I used to get pretty excited when I saw someone like Jimmy Connors or Pedro Martinez showing up for a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a new steakhouse or car wash, but they always jet out of town and their businesses never stay afloat for very long," said Fort Myers native Sherri Walsh, who pointed out the poor service and mediocre food at the numerous defunct crab shacks erected by members of the 1993 Chicago Cubs. "Now, there are too many vacant storefronts to even keep track of. Prime Time Security. Yoga by Yaz. Sir Charles' Gentleman's Club. All of them gone." "And I could have sworn the city shut down Lenny Dykstra's off-track betting parlor, but I still see him hanging around the back entrance all the time, so maybe it's still up and running," Walsh continued. According to sources, the array of failed athletes' businesses stands in stark contrast to the overwhelming success of former San Francisco Giants first baseman J.T. Snow's software company, Snow-Tek, which is estimated to be worth nearly $85 billion.

Area Man Self-Conscious About All The Wrong Things
MANASSAS, VA — Noting that he's frequently anxious and embarrassed by his most minor personality quirks and modest physical imperfections, sources confirmed Thursday that local sales associate Walter Markowitz is self-conscious about the completely wrong things. "My receding hairline has gotten a lot more noticeable lately, and I feel like women are constantly staring at it," said Markowitz, who consistently fixates on innocuous faults, from his slightly nasally voice to his mediocre penmanship, but never feels shame about his deep-rooted fear of commitment, the ease with which he grows angry, or how he always pushes to have things precisely his way in all situations. "I know I'm not always the most confident guy, but it isn't easy when you're my height. It gnaws at me that I could get more respect if I was a few inches taller." At press time, Markowitz was reportedly fretting over his unimpressive-sounding job title, completely ignoring how he's constantly belittling and abrasive to coworkers.

Man Always Taking Good Mood Out On Friends
NORFOLK, VA — Saying how difficult it is to be around him when he's unable to get a handle on his emotions, frustrated friends of local man James Melrose complained Tuesday that the 26-year-old is constantly taking his good mood out on them. "I didn't do anything to make him upbeat, so it's not really fair that I always end up getting pulled into it," said friend Christa Daniels, noting that she consciously avoids interacting with Melrose when he appears visibly happy and often tells him to take a deep breath and come back when he's calmed down. "Some days it's his love life, some days it's his work, and some days it's probably just a personality thing. Regardless, it's best to keep your distance when he's getting whatever he's going through out of his system; people only have so much patience for that kind of thing." At press time, Melrose was seen drinking at a local bar and unleashing so much pent-up positivity on his friends that several reportedly grew irritated and walked out.

Man Has No Idea What To Do With Good Mood
FRANKLIN, WI — Weighing various options for how to proceed given the unexpectedness of the situation, local 33-year-old Trevor Clifford was reportedly at a complete loss as to what he should do Monday after suddenly finding himself in a good mood. "Jeez, do I go outside or call someone up or something? I really have no clue what you're supposed to do here," said Clifford, who admitted he couldn't remember the last time he felt so cheerful or what he did when such a feeling last struck him. "I guess I could eat something, or maybe watch TV. Boy, I don't want to waste this, but I don't want to ruin it, either. I'm totally stumped on this." At press time, Clifford resolved to just stay seated and wait for the mood to pass.

Visit To Doctor Splurged On
WILMINGTON, DE — Admitting that it has been a long time since he's allowed himself such an indulgence, local 26-year-old Greg Burnet told reporters Thursday that he recently decided to splurge on an appointment with his general practitioner. "I've been pretty good about saving up my money and I thought now was the time to really treat myself to a medical examination of the chronic abdominal pain I've been experiencing," said the part-time office assistant and freelance graphic designer, adding that he was determined to "really pamper [himself]" by resting on an exam table as his doctor searched for a possible hernia. "Normally, I wouldn't be one to just throw money around on blood tests and X-rays like this, but today's all about me. Who knows, when I get the results back, I might even go all out on a trip to the hospital. I'd like to think I've earned it." When contacted following his appointment, Burnet informed reporters that the medical treatment had left him riddled with guilt, announcing repeatedly that he would be less impulsive and reckless with his money in the future.

Man Only Buys Products Made Right Here In The USA By Cheap Immigrant Labor
DANVILLE, KY — Saying that he doesn't want any of "that crap made in foreign countries," local man Doug Adelwright, 47, confirmed Tuesday that he only buys products manufactured right here in the United States by underpaid immigrant laborers. "I always buy American, because I believe in supporting businesses that don't move their factories overseas and instead employ illegal migrant workers to make things here at home," said Adelwright, adding that you'll never see a "made in Bangladesh" tag inside any of his shirts, because his clothes are made exclusively under U.S. sweatshop conditions. "Why should I buy stuff made by exploited foreigners in another country when I can buy stuff made by exploited foreigners who work on American soil? Look, I don't want my purchasing dollars to go straight to some other country; I want my money going to good, honest workers here in the United States who then immediately send the money to their families back in other countries." Adelwright also told reporters that he would choose the craftsmanship of a human-trafficking victim smuggled into the United States over the craftsmanship of a worker in a foreign country "any day of the week."

Deep Down, Area Man Knows He's Not Done Vomiting
NEW YORK — Speaking to reporters while crouched on the floor of his bathroom, local man Brandon Parker confirmed Tuesday that, deep down inside, he knows he has not yet finished vomiting. "I want to believe that I can get up right now and go lie down in bed, but If I'm being honest with myself, I have to admit I'm not done here yet," said the pallid, perspiring 26-year-old, hovering over the rim of his toilet and acknowledging that, in his heart of hearts, he is fully aware he should stay right where he is. "I just don't think I could look myself in the eye right now and say, 'Well, that's over with. I'm good to go.' No, this is where I should be." After several more minutes of silent contemplation, sources reported that Parker convinced himself that he had, in fact, finished vomiting, a position he later reversed in the hallway.

Wise Oracle Proclaims To All At Barbecue That He Felt A Raindrop
LITTLE ROCK, AR — Reading the signs written in the world around him to divine the course of events as yet unfolded, wise local oracle Phillip McKenna foresaw the arrival of ill weather at a neighborhood barbecue Monday and uttered a sharp warning to those gathered, eyewitnesses said. "Uh-oh. I just felt a raindrop, guys," the sage prognosticator declared to all, holding aloft his dampened wrist as testimony to his omen as he gazed into the heavens and interpreted its silent teachings. "It's looking pretty gray. Maybe we ought to get the food inside?" At last report, the discovery of condensation falling from an air conditioner had unmasked McKenna as a false prophet.

Deeply Held Conviction Immediately Dropped After Friend Half-Heartedly Disagrees
GREENSBURG, PA — While engaged in a casual conversation about their favorite bands Thursday, sources confirmed local resident Nick Saccia, 29, summarily abandoned one of his most strongly held convictions after sensing that his friend half-heartedly disagreed with it. "No, no, I totally hear that," said Saccia, instantaneously caving to his acquaintance's slight divergence of opinion and practically tripping over himself to calibrate a response that would bury his well-thought-out beliefs about a subject he has long felt passionately about. "I mean, yeah, that's a great point. I never thought they were that great or anything — they're just okay. Absolutely." At press time, Saccia was racing to redirect the discourse to a comfortable area of mutual agreement where they could safely carry out the remainder of the discussion by voicing identical opinions.

Mom Thought NFL's First Openly Gay Player Should Have Been Drafted Earlier
MINNETONKA, MN — Saying he was clearly one of the top choices and definitely should not have been one of the last players selected, local mother Annalise Callahan told reporters Monday that she thought Michael Sam, the NFL's first openly gay player, should have been drafted earlier. "I don't get why it took so long for him to get picked — he should have been one of the first ones," said Callahan, expressing her disbelief that the defensive end was selected 249th overall and noting that, if she were them, she would have chosen him as number one. "You'd think one of those teams would have picked him in the top 10. I mean, it would have at least been a nice thing to do. I don't know why they even chose all those fat guys before him who probably can't even run." Callahan went on to add that while she was happy for Sam, she shouldn't have to worry about seeing two men kissing every time she turned on her TV.

"Get the fuck out of my face," said one of the angry men as Rankin reportedly pretended to be engrossed in various features of his device and unaware of the two nearby men on the verge of physically assaulting one another. "I'm telling you, I will fuck you up. I will fuck you up!" At press time, the bus driver, who had been pretending he could not hear the two men threatening each other over the sound of the engine, briefly glanced in the rearview mirror.

Newborn Soothed By Familiar Sound Of Parents' Bickering
OLYMPIA, WA — After an extended period of fussing and crying in his bassinet, 10-day-old Joshua Brundage was reportedly calmed Sunday by the familiar sounds of his parents' raised voices, a daily occurrence that he is said to have grown accustomed to since gestating in the womb. Sources stated that around 7 p.m., the infant grew visibly relaxed in response to his mother's and father's distinctive verbal attacks, his stress levels clearly declining with each of his parents' soothing, repeated interjections of "Listen to me! Listen to me!" and "It's always my fault, isn't it? It's never you!" According to reports, within several minutes the incessant accusations and slamming of doors that were commonplace during Brundage's prenatal development and have continued in the days following his birth lulled him into a deep state of peaceful contentedness. As of press time, Brundage had drifted off to sleep, reportedly pacified by his mother's nightly refrain about when they'll have enough money to pay the fucking credit card bill.

Wedding DJ Assures Anxious Man He Hasn't Forgotten 'Build Me Up Buttercup' Request
WAUKESHA, WI — According to sources who attended Peter and Jillian Lefevre's wedding reception at the Loft & Chapel banquet hall last Saturday, event DJ Joel Kephart assured the man hovering nervously by his booth that he had not forgotten the guest's "Build Me Up Buttercup" song request from earlier that evening. "Yep, don't worry, I've got it on my list," Kephart said to the man who, throughout the previous four songs, had stood on the dance floor eagerly anticipating the 1968 Foundations hit, only to be repeatedly disappointed by a string of different pop standards. "I just played 'Brown Eyed Girl,' so I've got to mix it up. I'm going to play some slow stuff and then 'The Electric Slide,' but I'll get to yours sometime after that, okay?" Reports indicated the man became further agitated after an unmistakable guitar intro confirmed he had been jumped in line by the guy behind him who had asked for "Play That Funky Music."

Gas Station Clerk Glad To See Pump 2 Doing So Well Today
BOONEVILLE, MS — Surveying the eight gas pumps from his post behind the counter at the Walker Avenue Shell station, local clerk Marvin Peters told reporters he was especially pleased to see pump 2 performing so well among customers Thursday. "Pump 2 definitely gets short shrift because it's not the easiest to pull into and doesn't have a window wash station, so it's always nice when 2 pulls in the numbers it really deserves," said Peters, noting that he had been happy to see the trusty old fueling site "really take off" with several sedans and even a couple gas-guzzling vans a few hours into his morning shift. "You expect pump 4 or 8 to get this level of traffic, sure. And obviously nothing is ever going to measure up to pump 5 — clearly 5 is the most popular pump, and that's never going to change. But good ol' 2? Well, it has a little something special. It's nice to see an underdog get its due every once in a while." After taking one more fond glimpse at the pump, Peters then reportedly shook his head and chuckled warmly to himself as he watched some naive young fellow hauling a boat attempt to snake his way into pump 6.

Moviegoer Manages To Sneak Candy Past Teenage Usher Earning $7 An Hour
WESTBOROUGH, MA — Executing a plan he had carefully devised and practiced in his mind several times, local moviegoer Kevin Shepard managed to sneak his own candy past the teenage Regal Cinema usher earning $7 an hour Thursday, sources confirmed. "I made it. All I had to do was tuck the Crunch bar and gummy bears into my coat pocket, keep my left hand in there covering the candy, and not take it out until I sat down in the theater," a visibly pleased Shepard said after eluding the 17-year-old boy who had gotten stoned 90 minutes earlier and who typically spends the majority of his shift texting with friends whom he often lets into the theater for free. "I decided not to bring in a soda bottle because it would've stuck out of my coat and risked drawing too much attention. Then I just acted totally natural by making a little bit of eye contact when I handed him my ticket. Worked like a charm." As of press time, the 40-year-old man had slipped stealthily out the theater's back door and was quickly hurrying to his car in hopes of safely escaping the vicinity before the usher discovered the pile of incriminating wrappers left under his seat.

"Love you tons! Mom." At press time, Connor had reportedly traded his prescription medicine for a friend's Adderall.

RED BANK, NJ — Citing her relentless harassment of her peers, as well as her overall cruel and abrasive personality, the parents of local teen Lauren Hatcher expressed surprise Monday that the remorseless 15-year-old has yet to push a classmate past their breaking point. "Given our daughter's apparent desire to make others feel inferior, combined with our reluctance to confront her on such behavior, we really figured she'd have driven one of these kids off the edge by now," said Lauren's father, Jim Hatcher, noting that the merciless teenager, who has on multiple occasions brought her mother to tears, is adept at spreading false rumors and exploiting other people's insecurities. "She spends hours every day on Snapchat and other social apps — which we have no idea how to use or monitor — so we sort of assumed that by the middle of the school year or so, she would've written enough vicious, hate-filled messages to completely destroy at least one of her peers. But it's April now and somehow we still haven't gotten a call from the school principal saying she drove another kid to have a breakdown." At press time, the parents of several of the teen's classmates were marveling that their daughters were still hanging in there after the latest series of texts from the Hatcher girl.

Flight Attendant Quietly Informs First Class Passengers Where Real Emergency Exits Are
MIAMI — While passengers in the economy cabin watched the standard preflight safety video Monday, United Airlines flight attendant Kim Walters quietly informed first-class ticket holders aboard Flight 1173 of the location of the plane's actual emergency exits, sources confirmed. "Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll please give me your attention for a brief and important announcement about the first-class-only safety features of our Boeing 757 aircraft," Walters reportedly said in a voice just above a whisper, explaining that in an emergency, the airline's most valued customers should ignore the escape path lighting along the aisle and instead follow the green lighting on the first-class seatbacks to a secret hatch just behind the forward lavatory. "For your convenience, in the event of an emergency, a bulkhead will automatically close and seal off the first-class cabin from the economy cabin, giving you ample legroom while deplaning. In addition, should we experience a sudden loss of cabin pressure, ignore the oxygen masks that drop from above and instead use the real ones located underneath your seat, right next to your emergency parachute." According to reports, Walters then showed each passenger how to use their personal flotation raft, which she said comes with two weeks of gourmet rations, over 120 movies and TV shows, and is "[theirs] to keep" in the event of a water landing.

Exit From Apartment Delayed 20 Seconds To Avoid Pleasantries With Neighbor
SAN FRANCISCO — Having already put on his jacket and slung his messenger bag over his shoulder, 30-year-old Marcus Albright reportedly paused mere moments before opening his apartment door to leave for work Friday morning, delaying his exit some 20 seconds to avoid exchanging pleasantries with his neighbor across the hall. "I was just about to walk out, but then I heard Jeff [Wilhelm]'s door open and I heard him step out, so I just decided to wait inside for a few moments until he locked his door and left," said Albright, who reportedly stood quietly in his entryway holding his keys in his hand for nearly half a minute to prevent a congenial and passing dialogue with his neighbor. "I figured if I just hung out there until I heard him go down the stairs and then waited for the click of the front door to the building closing behind him then I should be good." At press time, Albright reportedly made an abrupt detour into a nearby convenience store after noticing Wilhelm waiting at his bus stop.

Man With No Plans Just Too Exhausted To Go Out
NORFOLK, VA — Cracking open a beer and settling into his couch Saturday night, local man Martin Burfette, who had no previously scheduled plans for the evening nor invitations to attend a social gathering of any kind, confirmed that he was simply too exhausted to leave his apartment. "I'm pretty beat; think I'll just kick back and stay in tonight," said the socially bereft 32-year-old, who decided that, "after the week [he] had," he would simply order takeout, watch Netflix, and fall asleep, a course of action that was essentially the only option available to him. "You know, I put in a lot of work over the past few days, so why shouldn't I give myself a break and relax? I could really use a little me time." Sources confirmed that Burfette leapt up instantaneously to grab his phone at the sound of an incoming text message.

Hypochondriac Convinced Patient Has Cancer
BRIDGEPORT, CT — During a regularly scheduled appointment at St. Vincent's Medical Center this afternoon, sources confirmed that after glancing at medical data for only a few moments, local hypochondriac Stephen Parsons became obsessively convinced that his patient Kevin Meadows has stage II leukemia. "This guy was completely neurotic. He just kept going on and on about how gravely sick I was, claiming my immune system was growing weaker every second and connecting every little symptom I've been experiencing over the past months to cancer," said Meadows, who attested that the deeply paranoid, overly health-conscious man even went so far as to demand a battery of complicated biopsies and blood tests right then and there. "He was practically freaking out for a while. I mean, this nut got himself so worked up that he began insisting the cancer was going to spread all over my body, and then started listing off a whole variety of treatments he felt I needed to receive immediately. Man, he needs to get a grip." Meadows added that the raving hypochondriac babbled something about Meadows only having 12 months to live, but mentioned that he had totally tuned him out by that point.

Report: Only 20 Minutes Until Introverted Man Gets To Leave Party
SAN MATEO, CA — Having already spent a considerable amount of time quietly examining items around the apartment and standing on the periphery of others' discussions until walking away under the pretense that he needed to refill his cup of beer, local introvert Dennis Brewer reported today that there are only 20 minutes left before he gets to leave an acquaintance's house party. "I told myself I'd stay here until 8:30, and I already killed about 15 minutes avoiding conversation by circling repeatedly around the table of hors d'oeuvres to appear occupied, and another cumulative half hour pretending to text friends, so I just need to make it a few more minutes," the tense man told reporters while sifting through a pile of coats on the host's bed as if he was having trouble locating his jacket, an activity he planned to perform for the next 10 minutes or until someone else entered the room. "If I walk back and forth between the conversations in the kitchen and the living room for a little while and go back to the bathroom one more time, then I'll have been here long enough to tell the host that I have some work to finish up before bed and that I should probably get going. Then it's just a matter of slipping on my shoes and waiting to tie them until I get out the door so that not too many people see me leaving and ask why I'm heading out so soon." At press time, sources reported that Brewer's plans for withdrawal were dangerously imperiled by a partygoer's insistence that the whole group hit up a nearby bar.

Physician Shoots Off A Few Adderall Prescriptions To Improve Yelp Rating
REDDING, CA — Noting that his practice's rating on the business review website had dipped to just 3.5 stars, local primary care provider Dr. Frank Hawley reportedly dashed off several Adderall prescriptions Monday to give his Yelp average a needed boost. "I keep a pretty close eye on my reviews, and whenever I see my number fall below four stars I just write out a few extra Adderall or Dexedrine scripts and it's back up in no time," said Hawley, adding that he usually ups the dosage to 30 milligrams and makes sure to prescribe two refills to ensure he stays near the top of the local general practice rankings. "Patients are always happy when I sign that prescription slip and hand it to them — it's pretty much a guaranteed five-star rating. In a business that survives by word of mouth, good reviews are absolutely essential." In addition, Hawley confirmed he hasn't advised a single patient to exercise regularly or maintain a healthy diet since 2011, saying he learned his lesson after receiving a devastating one-star review.

Woman Barely Jogging
PORTLAND, OR — Making negligible movements with her arms and legs as she sluggishly made her way along the sidewalk, a woman gradually progressing down Madison Street Friday was barely even jogging, sources confirmed. "She's definitely moving forward and kind of pumping her arms some, so it sort of looks like jogging, but, boy, it's a real stretch to call whatever that is 'jogging,'" said eyewitness Curtis Stoeller, 29, adding that the woman, outfitted in a colorful lycra top and athletic pants, expensive running shoes, and an armband holding an iPod, appeared to be making some kind of shuffling motion with her feet, but wasn't exerting nearly enough effort to approximate anything close to a jog, let alone a run. "It took her a long time to kind of lope past me on the sidewalk. If I just picked up my pace a little and walked briskly, I could catch up to her really fast. Jeez, is there even a word for what she's doing?" At press time, the shambling woman was squirting what appeared to be a vitamin-fortified water into her mouth as she brought two fingers to her neck to check her pulse.

Single Mother Hogging 2 Jobs
INDIANAPOLIS — Between her regular employment cleaning homes and side work waitressing at Perkins on mornings and weekends, 35-year-old single mother Janice Paulings is greedily hogging two jobs all to herself, outraged sources reported Monday. "I can't believe the nerve of some people, waking up before 5 a.m. each day to take the earlybird shift at a restaurant, then racing across town to drop her children off at school before selfishly putting in a full day at another job," Amos Waltham resentfully said of Paulings, adding that the shamelessly self-absorbed woman was also eager to pick up extra shifts wherever she could. "What about the rest of us? How are we supposed to find a steady source of income while she's collecting two separate paychecks and racking up as many as 80 hours a week? Some jerks only think of themselves and their three kids." Most irritating of all, Waltham noted, is that in addition to Paulings taking two jobs, her selfish children were also living it up by enjoying free government-subsidized breakfasts at school every day.

English Professor Suddenly Realizes Students Will Believe Literally Anything She Says
LINCOLN, NE — Midway through her 9 a.m. Intro to American Literature course Thursday, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Professor Elizabeth Mabrey suddenly realized that her students would accept, without question, literally any words that came out of her mouth as absolute, incontrovertible fact, sources confirmed. "I could say that On the Road was an overt metaphor for the Vietnam War and they would jot it down in their notebooks without any hesitation whatsoever," said Mabrey, adding that, come midterms, her students will, as if on cue, mindlessly regurgitate whatever she tells them, whether it's that the character of Dean Moriarty is supposed to be a figment of Sal Paradise's imagination, or that the entire novel is meant to be read backwards. "I could, honest to God, ask them to tear their copies of the novel in half because that's what Kerouac 'intended the reader to do,' and they would do it. I mean, what are they going to do? Disagree with me?" Professor Mabrey told reporters she has no plans to abuse her newly discovered power, though she would admittedly reconsider this position if denied tenure.

Insane Man Gets A Little Perspective By Reminding Himself That He Is God
RAPID CITY, SD — Saying he had been very hard on himself recently over a series of small mistakes, local clinically insane man Isaac Whipple, 38, put things in perspective Monday morning by reminding himself that he is God. "I have a tendency to beat myself up over the tiniest little things, so when I'm feeling down like this it always helps to just sit down, take a deep breath, and remember that I am the Great God Almighty, Supreme Lord and Ruler of All Creation, and that nothing happens unless I will it," the mentally ill Whipple told reporters, emphasizing that reminding himself he is immortal and holds sway over the lives of all living creatures "always calms [him] down a bit." "I'm my own biggest critic and I tend to make mountains out of molehills, so it's good to keep in mind the fact that I am a flawless and infallible being who controls everything that is and will ever be. I see all. I know all. I judge all. I am God. At the end of the day, that's all that matters." When reached for further comment, Whipple attributed his recent bout of insecurity to the tremendous stress involved in ruling over the pits of Hell, as he is also Satan.

Man Swells With Shame After Entering Zip Code Into Girl Scout Cookie Locator
CHAMPAIGN, IL — Shortly after conducting a Google search for "girl scout cookies buy," sources say local man Nicholas Tadros became engulfed in a powerful wave of self-loathing after making the conscious decision to enter his zip code into girlscoutcookies. org's Girl Scout Cookie locator. "Christ," said the thoroughly self-debased man as he clicked on a link called "Meet the Cookies" and read paragraph-long descriptions of Samoas, Trefoils, Savannah Smiles, and Do-Si-Dos, his entire being burning with white-hot humiliation and self-disgust. "What the fuck is wrong with me?" At press time, a visibly distressed Tadros was silently cursing himself as he filled out a Girl Scouts of Greater Chicago and Northwest Indiana's contact form so that a girl scout could personally help the abashed loser place an order.

Majority Of Office's Supplies Used To Apply For Different Job
ST. PAUL, MN — Sources at local digital marketing agency Fusion Media confirmed Monday that the company's stationery, broadband connection, printers, fax machines, and various other office equipment and supplies are primarily used by employees to apply for different jobs. "Do you know if we have any more printer paper in the supply closet — maybe some of that nicer, heavier-stock paper we use for presentations?" account executive Ingrid Zander was overheard asking office manager Heidi Campbell, who was herself reportedly using the company's digital postage meter to send off a résumé and cover letter to a competing business. "And could you check to see if we have any legal envelopes, too? I'm going to need seven of those." Sources also reported that the four Fusion Media employees who had taken a sick day Monday were all currently seated at a PR firm several blocks away interviewing for the same position.

Taxi Driver Just Taking His Time As If Man Not Late For Color Me Mine Pottery Party
PITTSBURGH — According to sources who don't see why he can't just step on the gas and get a move on already, a local taxi driver was apparently just taking his sweet time as if his passenger weren't 10 goddamned minutes late for a Color Me Mine pottery party. "I told you to take the freeway, man — c'mon, I'm going to be super late," said passenger Alan Tate to the taxi driver, who either didn't know or just flat-out didn't care that the paint-your-own-pottery party that Tate was on his way to was already underway and would likely run out of Midnight Black glaze within minutes. "Please, please, please just hurry up, okay? It's really important." At press time, well, there go Tate's chances of painting an entire bouquet of ceramic Funky Flowers.

Employees Given List Of Doctors Shitty Enough To Accept Company's Health Insurance Plan
MILWAUKEE — In an effort to itemize the health benefits available through its current PPO plan, local business CargoFly Logistics provided its staff members Wednesday with a list of doctors who are shitty enough to accept the company's health insurance. "All full-time employees are eligible for coverage at the following health care providers," wrote benefits director Caroline Murray in an office-wide email, which gave the names, addresses, and phone numbers of roughly a dozen terribly rated and inconveniently located general practitioners who are desperate enough to take the company's atrocious insurer, including at least three who do not typically cater to English-speaking patients. "Any employee who wishes to seek treatment from a doctor not included on this list will be required to pay for those services out of pocket." Murray added that CargoFly workers should not hesitate to contact her at any time if they need the name of an in-network specialist who is currently under investigation by the state's medical review board.

Man Worried About Drug Dealer Who's Not Picking Up Phone
ATLANTA — Growing increasingly concerned with each successive call, local man Ryan Mead, 24, began to worry late Tuesday afternoon after his drug dealer, Jared, failed to pick up his phone. "He usually always picks up around this time — I hope he's okay," Mead told reporters as he anxiously paced around his apartment, considering the possibility that the 19-year-old purveyor of marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy could be lost, scared, and all alone out there somewhere. "Why isn't he answering? I texted him, 'Jared. Please, please pick up your phone,' but he hasn't responded. He's got me worried sick!" After nearly 15 minutes with no response, Mead lost all hope and called his other guy.

Parents Finally Cave And Buy 33-Year-Old Son PlayStation 1
KENOSHA, WI — Having refused to purchase the video game console since its introduction in 1994, local parents John and Melissa Gionda confirmed Thursday that they had finally caved in and bought a Sony PlayStation 1 for their 33-year-old son, Daniel. "It has some violent games I still don't approve of, but I know it's something Daniel really wanted, so we finally figured, 'Why not?' " Melissa Gionda said shortly after purchasing a bundle package containing the PlayStation console, a 1-megabyte memory card, and copies of Crash Bandicoot, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, and Spyro The Dragon for the 2002 college graduate and digital marketing analyst. "We've always felt that video games would have been a huge distraction from his schoolwork and first four jobs after college, but Daniel has been patient and waited long enough to get a PlayStation. As long as he doesn't sit around all day in front of the TV, it'll be fine. And we got him an extra controller, too, so he can play it with his friends or his son Mark." Despite buying the video game system, the Giondas confirmed that they still refuse to buy the 33-year-old a copy of the 1992 Megadeth album Countdown To Extinction.

Passenger Assures Flight Attendant He Has Opened Emergency Exit Dozens Of Times Before
SALT LAKE CITY — When asked if he needed any special instructions for the safety hatch's use, airline passenger Jeffrey Evars reportedly assured a Delta flight attendant Wednesday that he had both sat in exit rows and opened emergency exit doors many, many times before. "Yeah, yeah, I open these all the time — don't worry about it," Evars reportedly told the flight attendant, waving her away as he explained that he cracks open the sealed evacuation doors on nearly every plane trip he takes. "Trust me, I'm an old pro at this. You just crank the lever down and twist it a few times. It's easy. Here, look, I'll pop this one open now." At press time, Evars had opened the emergency exit, deployed the inflatable slide, and left the plane.

Giant Burrito To Solve All Of Area Man's Problems For 6 Precious Minutes
GREENSBORO, NC — According to sources at a local Qdoba, 31-year-old advertising sales associate Anthony Gerrit is about to purchase an extra-large burrito that will completely resolve every concern, burden, and troublesome issue in his life for six blissful minutes. "I'll have a chicken burrito, please," said Gerrit, soon to be overcome with feelings of pure joy, without a care in the world about his work performance or whether his coworkers like him. "With some brown rice." "And black beans," Gerrit added as the burrito — which for the next few minutes will remove any expectations from his family to be as successful as his other siblings — was slid over to the next employee in the food preparation line. "Thanks." Reports confirmed that upon taking his first bite of the Mexican delicacy at approximately 6:42 p.m., Gerrit will be instantly liberated from having to pay any outstanding credit card bills, car payments, or monthly rent. Prior to taking his final bite six minutes later, Gerrit will also be spared any guilt for not calling or visiting his parents more often, and especially for his decision not to come home for Thanksgiving this year. Additionally, sources said, the burrito and a medium soda will cost $7.84 and for 360 glorious seconds fully absolve Gerrit from his responsibility to finish a major work project by next Monday's deadline, erase his $14,000 outstanding student loan debt, and halt the declining health of his 82-year-old grandmother. "Can I just get some pico de gallo and cheese?" said Gerrit, selecting toppings that will negate any pressure to settle down and start a family like many of his friends from high school and college. "And a little bit of sour cream." "Actually, you know what, forget the sour cream — make it guacamole instead," added Gerrit, removing his wallet to pay for the 7-inch-long, 5-inch-wide temporary solution to all of his problems. Sources said the burrito will not only provide a resolution to the 31-year-old's recent fight with his girlfriend over moving in together after the lease on his apartment runs out, but also completely erase any lingering questions in his mind about whether their relationship has run its course. According to reports, as soon as Gerrit sits down in one of the restaurant's booths and begins eating, he will be immediately transported to a wondrous, perfect world in which any and all of life's difficulties are simply washed away, replaced instead by a warm flour tortilla tightly packed with chicken, rice, beans, salsa, and vegetables. While consuming the meal, Gerrit will reportedly not even need a job or a girlfriend or money or an apartment or a graduate degree or groceries or clean laundry or a new couch or a reliable internet connection or better health insurance or good credit or a cheaper cell phone plan or allergy medication or a new pair of jeans that aren't torn at the bottom or a flu shot or gas for his car or general satisfaction with his life or, indeed, anything at all. "Sorry, can you just add a little extra chicken before you close it? It's fine if it costs more," said Gerrit, moving toward the cash register to collect his short-lived salvation from life's inherent sadness, angst, fear, hopelessness, anger, uncertainty, and pain. "That's perfect." At press time, after filling his cup with soda, sitting down, and peeling back his dinner's aluminum foil wrapper, Gerrit entered a world where in fact the only thing that exists — the only thing at all — is one delicious, savory burrito.

Report: Maid Of Honor Not Even That Good Of Friends With Bride
LENOX, MA — Citing the pair's apparent lack of regular communication and a general sense they had grown apart, bridal party sources confirmed Friday that Lindsay Kirkpatrick's maid of honor, Allison Weiler, isn't even all that good of friends with the bride, at least not since they were in college and even then you wouldn't have said they were best friends or anything. "Alli? Really? Alli lives in Denver and they see each other like twice a year," said Jess, 27, a reportedly super-close friend of Kirkpatrick's, who went on to add that, yes, Lindsay obviously has a solid friendship with Alli, especially since they studied abroad together in Barcelona, but in the years since they graduated Jess, Kate, and Linds have become extremely close, noting that all three just went to New Orleans for a friends' weekend and Linds never even mentioned inviting Alli. "Alli's great, sure. And it'll be so good to see her. But maid of honor? Am I missing something? I seriously don't even remember the last time Linds brought her up in conversation. Lindsay talks to Tina more than Alli." Bridal party sources added, I mean, Tina.

Protagonist Rapidly Getting Dressed Must Be Late, Reports Cunning Viewer Recognizing Film's Subtext
LOUISVILLE, KY — Pointing out multiple visual and diegetic cues that seem to suggest the character is running behind schedule, cunning 25-year-old movie watcher Alex Midthun told reporters Thursday that he can tell the protagonist of the film he is currently watching must be late for something. "It's all implied beneath the surface, of course, but the references to the lead character's lateness are there — for instance, the fact that he overslept is, I believe, strongly suggested by the shot of him waking up, seeing the time on his alarm clock, and bolting out of bed," noted the stunningly observant man, who also referred reporters to the shot of the protagonist hopping around on one pant leg and scrambling to get dressed as a subtle yet apparent indication that the character almost certainly has an appointment of some kind for which he is currently running late. "This moment here, where he's shoving his arms through his coat while holding a cup of coffee in one hand, informs the viewer, if only on an unconscious level, that perhaps this man is worried about not arriving on time to a location where his presence is in some way expected or required. That's what I get from it, anyway, although I admit I have a tendency to overanalyze this stuff." The abundantly clever man went on to caution that to draw any conclusions from the shot of a broken framed photo on the lead character's mantel showing the protagonist and an unidentified woman in a wedding dress would, at this point, be pure conjecture.

Doctor Quickly Scribbles Prescription That Will Lead To 30-Year Battle With Painkiller Addiction
TAMPA, FL — After a brief consultation with new patient Dan Highland, local primary care physician Dr. Harold Schlesinger quickly scribbled down a prescription that will touch off a self-destructive 30-year battle with painkiller addiction, sources confirmed Tuesday. "I gave you a few refills in case the pain lingers," said Schlesinger, casually handing over a slip of paper that effectively set in motion three decades of compulsive abuse of opioids, a torturous cycle of detox and relapse, and a dark, drawn-out period of pain and anguish that will not only consume Highland, but his family members and friends as well. "Let me know if this dosage isn't strong enough, and I'll either bump you up or we'll get you on something new." Schlesinger quickly added that while it's recommended that patients not drink alcohol while on the prescription, in practice Highland should "just use moderation."

Adopted Child Sick Of Gay Parents Forcing Him To Watch Them Have Sex
LACONIA, NH — Saying that the experience has been highly detrimental to his development as a happy, healthy, and spiritually grounded member of society, local adopted child Nicholas Brown told reporters Thursday he has grown sick and tired of his homosexual parents always forcing him to watch while they have sex. Brown, a nine-year-old boy who ever since being taken in by same-sex partners Ethan and Thomas Brown has been repeatedly compelled to witness his adoptive parents have unrestrained sexual intercourse, claimed that these ongoing episodes have had an extremely deteriorative effect on his budding moral values. "Ever since I got here, it's the same routine every day: As soon as I get home from school, my dads lead me into their bedroom, lock the door, and make me watch them go at it for hours and hours," said Brown, emphasizing that this never-ending ritual has had a "toxic" effect on his impressionable young mind. "I wake up in the morning, and they're in my bedroom having sex. They drive me to school, and they're going down on each other in the front seat. I hate it. "I try to tell them 'Hey, you guys, your godless acts are corrupting me and causing long-term psychological and emotional damage,' but they just don't listen," he added. According to Brown, since being adopted in the summer of 2010, his new parents have, under the state's permissive adoption laws, brought him into an environment in which he is subjected to explicit gay sex on a daily basis. Brown said that since involuntarily joining the household, his parents have mandated that he observe them engage in thousands of carnal activities, all of which he claimed have irreversibly "warped" his fledgling moral principles. Furthermore, Brown noted that on those rare occasions in which his parents are not forcing him to watch them enthusiastically fornicate with both one another and a rotating cast of friends, men they pick up at night clubs, and complete strangers, they have done everything in their power to make sure he remains under their influence. "There's a TV in the living room that's always playing these gay porno movies, and it's all we ever watch," said Brown, who identified his adoptive parents as his de facto role models and the only people he has the option of looking up to during his current, formative years. "I try to get away from it by playing in the park or going to church like normal kids do, but my dads always bring me back home and make me watch them jerk each other off. At this point, the gay lifestyle is all I know. "They're raising me as one of their own," Brown continued, adding his belief that his parents' homosexuality is also eroding the spiritual identity of the larger community. In addition to his day-to-day life watching his parents participate in sodomy, group sex, fisting, heavy bondage, piss play, zoophilia and extended bouts of anilingus, Brown revealed that his guardians have done their best to instill their own unique beliefs and perspectives into their son through varied non-sexual behavior that includes drug abuse, repeatedly denying the existence of God, and advocating for socialized medicine. However, in the face of the unyielding nature of these and other proclivities that are constantly being forced on him, the vulnerable adolescent told reporters that he often feels an overriding emptiness that other children his age don't have to contend with. "I really want to have strong values like my friends, but I know that won't happen if I'm watching my dads have sex all the time," said Brown, who noted that he himself unwillingly began harboring an intense desire to have intercourse with men the moment he was inducted into his new family. "As long as I'm under their roof, I'll never have an idea of what a regular life is like, and I'll never get the chance to grow into a normal, well-rounded adult." "And to think, every kid in the country with gay parents is probably going through the exact same harrowing experience as me," he added.

Siblings Patiently Waiting For Day They'll Be Close To Each Other
CHARLOTTE, NC — Though they never formed a tight-knit bond as kids and still haven't as adults, siblings Macy and Kyle Treadgold continue to wait patiently for the day they'll finally grow close to each other, sources reported Thursday. "I thought it might happen when I was a senior in college and she was a freshman, because I figured the chance to hang out away from our parents would bring us closer together, but yeah, that didn't happen," said Kyle Treadgold, 31, whose sister Macy, 29, confirmed that despite saying "I love you" after their infrequent phone conversations, the siblings still feel no real connection at all. "Then when we were both in our twenties and living in the same city, I thought for sure we were finally at that age when we'd become friends. But somehow that didn't pan out either. At this point, I think it may take a major family tragedy for us to form a lasting tie. We'll probably have to wait until Mom or Dad dies." According to a report suddenly received at press time, even that hasn't managed to do it.

Area Woman Thinking About Doing That Thing Where She's Mean To Other Women She Meets For No Reason
TACOMA, WA — Local woman Jillian Lauretta confirmed to reporters Friday that she was thinking of doing that thing where she acts incredibly cold and unfriendly toward other women she has just met for absolutely no earthly reason whatsoever. "You know, I think I might just go ahead and make a couple women whom I don't know and whom I have absolutely no reason to dislike feel very uncomfortable and insecure by greeting them with a tight-lipped smile and then silently judging them," said the 32-year-old accounts manager, adding that she might even tack on the whole bit where she reacts to every perfectly pleasant thing another woman says with chilly near-silence and then, when said woman leaves the room, say something mildly cutting about her in a way that opens the conversation up to outright trash talk if anyone else is so inclined. "While I'm at it, I'll probably feel threatened by her based on nothing at all and then make little passive-aggressive asides about her — whereas she'll just be really friendly to me, which will only make me feel small and petty, and my self-loathing will drive me to irrationally despise her all the more." At press time, reports indicate that Lauretta was not laughing at a humorous remark another woman was making.

Area Child Disappointed To Learn Parents' Love Unconditional
IRVINE, CA — Saying he doesn't even feel like trying anymore, 8-year-old Max Bledsoe expressed his strong disappointment Monday after learning that his parents' love is unconditional. "I always thought they loved me because I'd actually earned it, but unfortunately it turns out that their affection is apparently limitless," said a frustrated Bledsoe, wondering aloud the point of doing well in school, learning how to play the piano, and always going to bed before 9 p.m. if his parents were just going to keep on loving him no matter what. "Look at me: I just wasted the last three years of my life trying to win their approval by being a good kid. And for what? To get the love that was coming to me anyway?" Bledsoe added that he envied his adopted younger brother, who really has to work for his parents' love.

Kindergarten Class Burning Through 6 Hamsters A Year
LIGONIER, PA — Attributing the high levels of attrition to a combination of handling errors and poor oversight, Holy Trinity School kindergarten teacher Alyssa D'Orazio told reporters today that her class is currently burning through hamsters at a rate of six per year, with every indication that the figure will rise. "We blew through two in one week this October," said D'Orazio, adding that if her students continue to cycle through the rodents at this pace, current classroom pet Lancelot likely will not live to see Thanksgiving break. "Take-homes are now a hard, hard no. But I figure if we reduce out-of-cage playtime and take Rory and Eva off feeding privileges entirely, we might be able to get the average down to a more reasonable number." D'Orazio added that if Benjamin Szygenda were to be transferred to a different class, it would likely have an "enormously positive" effect on their average hamster's lifespan.

BOSTON — While speaking with his mother over the phone Monday evening, sources confirmed that 27-year-old marketing coordinator Daniel Hewitt lied about every single detail of his life in order to keep his parents from worrying about him. Hewitt reportedly updated his mother with a litany of false information throughout the 18-minute conversation and, in an attempt to spare her from any distress, blatantly distorted the truth about his job, finances, social life, living situation, and overall level of happiness. "Everything's good here," said Hewitt in the first of what would amount to over three dozen flat-out lies. "Work has been going well. It's fun, and everyone at the office is really nice. I'm learning a lot." "I really love it out here," Hewitt continued. "It's great." Hewitt, who moved this past September from Bloomington, IL to Boston for a new job, is said to receive a phone call from home about once a week and has reportedly struggled to adjust to his new surroundings, feeling increasingly lonely and isolated. However, sources confirmed that the man who regularly questions whether he made a poor decision by relocating across the country has yet to report even one negative aspect of his life to his parents. "My apartment's great — it's nice and big, so I have plenty of room," said Hewitt, adding that his monthly rent is "pretty reasonable" and that he lives in "a really safe area" of the city. "Yeah, the heat works well, Mom — it's nice and warm in here. And if there's ever any problem, my landlord is very responsive and fixes things right away." "So, what have you and Dad been up to these days?" added Hewitt in a desperate attempt to steer the conversation away from himself. According to reports, in order to prevent his parents from fretting about his financial situation, Hewitt vaguely claimed to be "making enough money" and "saving a little bit each month." The 27-year-old went on to stress that he was in no need of any extra finances and neglected to mention that he currently has less than $400 in his savings account. Hewitt, who has reportedly eaten frozen pizza for dinner four times this week and spends virtually every night after work zoning out in front of his television, then told his mother that he "started going to a gym recently." Sources said that after he was asked about his company's health care plan, Hewitt remained totally silent for several seconds before quickly muttering, "It's good, really good." "I've made plenty of friends here in the last few months," said Hewitt, reportedly doing his best to hide his congested voice so as not to alert his mother that he recently caught a cold. "I hang out with them all the time. We go out together and do all sorts of stuff. I'm definitely having a lot of fun." "I'm doing fine," Hewitt added. "I'm really fine." Rather than explain that he spent the past weekend alone in his apartment sleeping until the late afternoon and then playing video games, Hewitt went on to say that he has "been seeing all the sights in Boston," claiming that he has already visited a museum and that he went to a Bruins game the other week. Fearing that she would discover the actual, authentic realities of his life, Hewitt then politely rejected his mother's offer to come visit him, reportedly claiming that "now isn't the best time, but maybe in a few months." "I'll be sure to call you if I need anything," lied Hewitt as the phone call drew to a close. "I actually have to get going, though. I have plans with some friends tonight." "Miss you, too," added Hewitt quickly in his only moment of genuine honesty.

Pathetic Hands Subject To Man's Every Whim
FREDERICK, MD — Calling them spineless and utterly devoid of dignity, witnesses described Wednesday how the pathetic hands of local man David Bromley allow themselves to be subjected to his every whim. "Look at how those meek little stooges obey his every command, no questions asked; have they no sense of shame at all?" said observer Jane Hadfield, 37, noting that if the subservient worms had an ounce of guts they would have stood up to Bromley years ago. "It's as if they're oblivious to how embarrassing it all looks. If he says right, they go right. If he says clench, these weak-willed saps clench until he tells them it's okay to release. I bet you they'd press themselves against a hot stove if he wanted them to." At press time, Bromley and a potential business client were forcing their respective minions to engage in a humiliating little hug.

Rival Dojo In For Big Surprise At Regionals
ASHBURN, VA — Local 17-year-old Clint Hrabik, a second kyū brown belt at Ashburn Enshin Karate, issued a statement Wednesday indicating that rival dojo Falls Church Enshin Karate was in for a big surprise at regionals this year. "Sensei Nima and his students may think they're the best dojo in northeastern Virginia, but they will soon learn they are quite mistaken; we've been doing things a little differently up here in Loudoun County," said Hrabik, cryptically hinting that Ashburn's Sensei Vlado has taught his second-place team "a little something" Falls Church won't be expecting. "Let's just put it this way: We've incorporated a very interesting new technique into our training. And Sensei has taught us well." Region 2 AAU Karate championships will take place Dec. 1 at 2 p.m. in the Fairfax High School boys' gymnasium.

Nemesis Lands Alumni Magazine Cover
ROCKVILLE, MD — Looking through her mail upon returning home from work Monday, Kenyon College graduate Halley Katz was reportedly repulsed and angered to discover that her cursed archrival had landed the cover of her college's alumni magazine. "There are a number of major players in the crowdsourcing game, but I saw that no one was filling this particular niche, so I just went for it," said the bitter adversary '06 in an extensive interview about her new online teen-focused fundraising platform, which the villainess founded to help provide high school students with a means to realize their artistic dreams. "I've always loved working with underserved communities, and I could envision the immense benefits such a venture could bring to students, so I just thought, well, why can't we take the guesswork out of this and make it kid-friendly? And it's been a dream come true for [a detestable, antagonistic scourge like] me." Upon further review of the magazine's class notes sections, Katz was further dejected to learn the one she let slip away had become an executive producer at Nickelodeon.

Word Search On Box Of Frosted Mini-Wheats Fucking Impossible
TROY, NY — A word search puzzle featured on the back of a Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats box is just about fucking impossible, local man Glenn McCurdy confirmed Thursday. "Jesus Christ, why can't I fucking do this?" said McCurdy, 34, referring to the impenetrable 10-letter by 10-letter grid, which reportedly includes such words as "breakfast," "milk," and "fun." "I've been at it for almost an hour, and even the ones I got were some kind of fucking miracles. I mean, it looks like some of these words are in there backwards. Who the hell do they think I am? Bill fucking Gates?" At press time, a frustrated McCurdy had torn apart the cereal box to access the answers printed on the inside.

Undertaker's Last Few Embalmings Before Summer Vacation Always A Little Sloppy
SKOKIE, IL — As vacation season approaches and local Donnellan Family Funeral Services staff prepare for their summer breaks, mortuary director Gene Donnellan told reporters Friday that the last few embalmings he performs before vacation are "typically pretty slapdash." "To be perfectly honest, I'm pretty much exhausted that whole week before I'm off, so by the time I get to the last few bodies I usually end up overdoing the formaldehyde and skipping right to the cavity drainage," Donnellan said of his "admittedly messy" last-minute process, which, he added, "is far from [his] best work but gets the job done." "Look, if it's six o'clock on Friday and I've got two weeks in the Virgin Islands ahead of me, it's not like I'm going to get to every toe. And then I'll just pack the anus and vagina with gauze to prevent seepage, put the bag of organs at the base of the casket, and call it a day." At press time, Donnellan was absentmindedly suturing a corpse's mouth shut while thinking about what kind of tropical drink he was going to order.

Loose-Knit Community Not Particularly Shattered By Teen's Death
WINDEN FALLS, WA — Just days after a fatal accident claimed the life of high school sophomore Brian Tillerman, members of the 16-year-old's loose-knit hometown of Winden Falls, WA told reporters Thursday they were not all that devastated by the news of his death. Saying that the tragedy certainly hadn't touched each of them personally, the 9,300 barely connected Winden Falls residents explained that they did not struggle to absorb the news of Tillerman's sudden passing and don't really feel as if a hole has been left in their community. "I didn't really know Brian or his family very well, so none of this hits home for me," said local mother Jessica Winger, who noted that her children didn't grow up with Tillerman, didn't play Little League with him, and didn't see him every day in school, and admitted that, even if they had, she probably wouldn't remember him. "I can't say life in Winden Falls has changed in any noticeable way since Brian's death. And to be honest, it never really crossed my mind to keep him in my thoughts and prayers." "I'd say that everyone in town pretty much knows how we're going to get through the days ahead," Winger continued. "Frankly, it'll probably be pretty easy to move on from this." Tillerman, who was killed Sunday morning when he lost control of his car on a wet road and skidded into a tree, was described by community members as a student at one of Winden Falls' two high schools who probably had a group of friends, could have possibly attended church regularly with his parents, and may or may not have had a bright future ahead of him. Describing their small, quiet village as "cold" and "unwelcoming," the vast majority of town residents said they would not attend a memorial for Tillerman over the weekend, admitting that coming together in solidarity with their fellow residents actually sounded uncomfortable and seemed like a pretty big hassle. "This really hasn't been too hard on all of us," said Donald Parker, a local general store owner who claimed he doesn't know or converse with his customers and had no idea whether or not Tillerman came into his shop regularly. "You see, most of the people in Winden Falls haven't lived in town for too long, and we're by no means a part of each other's daily lives, so rallying behind Brian's family and offering our support didn't feel at all like the natural thing to do." "The thing is, when something like this happens to someone in our community, it pretty much only impacts that one person," Parker continued. "That's just how it is in Winden Falls." Gloria Murphy, a 66-year-old retiree who has lived for many years on the same street as the Tillermans, confirmed to reporters that she spoke only a few quick words in passing to Brian's parents and siblings over the past decade. Like most town residents, Murphy said she never invited her fellow townsfolk into her home and pretty much sought to minimize all interactions with those living near her. "In this town, neighbors definitely don't count on one another or look after each other — we pretty much just keep to ourselves," said Murphy, who noted that she hadn't observed anything close to a community-wide outpouring of sympathy following the accident. "I don't think anyone around here has ever felt as if their neighbors were like members of their own family, and this accident certainly hasn't changed that view." "People from Winden Falls are definitely not the people you want around you in a time like this," Murphy added. Community leaders have reportedly neither reached out to Tillerman's family nor sought to publicly comfort and reassure residents in the wake of the tragedy, with Winden Falls mayor Toby Leekham noting that he has felt personally unmoved by the teen's death. "Townspeople haven't really mentioned anything about preserving Brian's memory, so that's something we probably won't do," Mayor Leekham said. "More than anything, I think this tragic accident has demonstrated to everyone just how distant and uncaring the Winden Falls community truly is." Added Leekham, "Honestly, most of us have already forgotten all about Brian."

Gun Show Vendor Jokes With Insane Customer About How He Hopes He's Not Insane
ANDERSON, IN — While he was selling mentally unstable customer Bernie Lovell a brand-new hunting rifle earlier this afternoon, local gun show vendor Mark Palmer joked with the new firearm owner and insane man about how he "sure hopes" he's not insane. "Boy, that sure would be something if you turned out to be one of those lunatics who shoots up a school or a mall or whatnot, right? Ha, ha!" said Palmer, laughing unknowingly with a clinically deranged individual about how the man "better not be a crazy person." "Promise not to do that? Ha, just kidding! Anyway, you need some ammo with this?" Immediately after the two finished laughing, Lovell grabbed the rifle, stared blankly at Palmer's face for 20 seconds, and left the gun show.

Awkward New International Student Saw His Entire Family Murdered In The Congo
PITTSBURGH — Thomas A. Edison High School's new international student, Joseph Ombale, who saw his family, friends, and neighbors brutally murdered and mutilated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been described by classmates as a "total weirdo," and "kind of a spaz," sources confirmed Tuesday. The awkward 16-year-old, who went to bed every night fearing he would be woken by the sound of armed rebels bursting through his front door, reportedly keeps to himself throughout the school day, has been called a "dipshit" behind his back by numerous students, watched his entire village burn to the ground as part of a civil war that has raged on for 20 years, and is beginning his first year in an American high school. "I don't know, I think he's kind of strange," sophomore Claire Moman said of Ombale, who has seen more the 50 people, including his grandmother, get hacked apart with machetes. "He never talks to anyone during homeroom and he just stares out of the window a lot." "During the fall sports pep rally, he just sat there and didn't cheer or anything," Moman continued, referring to the now brother and sister-less Ombale. "Connor [Benson] says he might be retarded. Calling him a "freaking dork," students have told reporters they wouldn't be caught dead sharing a lunch table with Ombale, the only one of his childhood friends not kidnapped and forcibly recruited in the rebel army, and the only current student at Edison High who was ever forced to suppress his screams by militiamen while his mother was tortured and raped multiple times by multiple soldiers and then murdered. In one embarrassing incident last week, class sources confirmed that Ombale let out a brief, nervous shriek during 2nd period Biology when the teacher loudly closed the classroom door. The sound reportedly triggered a memory in which Ombale's best friend was gunned down with an AK-47, and prompted his classmates to laugh at him and ask, "Dude, seriously, what is your problem?" In addition, multiple students said Ombale, who once spent six hours hiding beneath his dead relatives' bloodied bodies in order to avoid detection by those looking to kill him and any other members of his village, has shown little enthusiasm for P.E.'s basketball unit, with several of his teammates holding him directly responsible for losing three games in a row. "On offense, he doesn't know what he's doing, and on defense he just lets his man get around him most times," said Mark Conover, 16, referring to the teenager who knows what charred flesh smells like and could do nothing to stop rebel soldiers from disemboweling a pregnant woman right before his eyes. "He's so fucking annoying. Many students commented on the fact that Ombale skipped last Friday's back-to-school carnival and ice-cream social, didn't sign up for any committees, and chose not to participate in float decorating for next month's upcoming Spirit Week. Come December, it will have been nine months since he watched his father dragged into the village square and shot in the forehead. "He's such a loser," said Danica Martray of the boy who has seen infants sliced in half, grew up accepting the inherent risk that he might step on a landmine while playing soccer, and has witnessed large groups of men and women grieving hysterically. "I swear to God he was born without a personality. He just makes everyone else uncomfortable." "Amanda was assigned to be his lab partner in Chemistry and she's trying to get out of it," she added. "I seriously can't imagine anything more horrible than that." With classmates saying there is little to no chance of Ombale ever fitting in at the school, especially because he dresses weird and doesn't even know what "Blurred Lines" is, students told reporters they wished he would just go back to wherever it is he came from.

Dad Can't Believe Lawn Didn't Get Him Anything For Father's Day
WINCHESTER, VA — Telling reporters that he can't help but feel a little hurt, 52-year-old local father Trevor Jackson expressed his surprise and disappointment Sunday that his lawn didn't bother to get him anything for Father's Day this year. "It's not like I expect a big production on Father's Day or anything, but I guess I thought my lawn would get me some sort of little present — a card, at the very least," said Jackson, adding that as the day went on, he slowly realized he wouldn't be receiving any kind of gift at all from the grass in his front yard. "I care for it, I buy it anything it needs, I spend every weekend with it, and on the one day that's supposed to be about me, I don't even get so much as a 'Happy Father's Day' greeting. I mean, would it kill my lawn to show me just a little appreciation once a year?" Despite his initial frustration, Jackson later confirmed that taking care of his lawn is its own reward, and he was happy to simply have a quiet Sunday afternoon together with the patch of fertilized grass.

Sight Of Coworkers' Stupid Fucking Faces Endured Yet Again
WASHINGTON — After a brief two-day reprieve from looking at them day in and day out, Americans across the nation were yet again forced to endure the sight of their coworkers' stupid fucking faces as they entered the office Monday morning. "Yup, there they are — sitting there again with those big dumbfuck looks on their big dumbfuck faces," said local claims adjuster Martin Barker, echoing the thoughts of millions of people who don't particularly dislike their coworkers, per se, but really want to punch each one of them square in their fucking noses every single time they see them. "And now I suppose I'll have to hear them open their annoying fuckface mouths and talk, talk, talk like a bunch of annoying fuckfaces while I try to get through the rest of my seemingly endless shitshow of a day. Fucking Christ." At press time, millions of people across the nation were "really looking forward" to going home and having to look at their family members' idiotic goddamned faces again too.

"All right, we're doing this now — you will tell me," Sterling said after cornering Mobley in the breakroom and demanding to know the number, approximate age, and gender of Mobley's as-yet-undefined brothers and sisters, emphasizing that "[he was] through fucking around." "Just give it to me straight and we'll be done with this. How many siblings do you have? Tell me. Now. Go." Mobley responded that he has an older sister, two younger brothers, and an older half-brother from his father's first marriage.

High School Breathes Sigh Of Relief As Difficult Teacher Ages Out Of Education System
CLEVELAND — Faculty and staff at Baxter High expressed a profound sense of relief Monday upon learning that the school's most infamous troublemaker, 65-year-old geology teacher Sharon Fisher, had finally reached retirement age and exited the education system. "We're not supposed to say this kind of thing, but she was truly awful," said principal Dayna Carrier, who noted that in addition to her behavior problems, Fisher had performed poorly in every one of her classes since arriving at the school in 1983. "She never paid attention, had one of the worst attitudes I've ever encountered, and was a constant disruption in the classroom. Now, thankfully, she'll be someone else's problem." Faculty members were reportedly disappointed to learn that Fisher's replacement would be Ernest Hughes, 31, another reputed "problem teacher" who has been in and out of several schools already.

Man's Idea For Tweet Just Pops Into His Mind Almost Fully Formed
TRENTON, NJ — In an astonishing moment of creative inspiration, local Twitter user Chase Munson, 29, told reporters Monday that his latest idea for a tweet had simply popped into his head all at once, almost fully composed. "I was driving back from the store, and it just came to me out of nowhere, nearly word for word — the whole tweet!" said Munson, adding that the rapidly conceived-of tweet arrived in his mind complete with an appropriate hashtag and fell well within the social media site's 140-character limit. "I mean, it was all there, the whole thing. A finished work. It was amazing." At press time, sources confirmed Munson's masterpiece had been "favorited" by two of his friends.

Street Musician's Mother Really On His Case About Practicing His Buckets
NEW YORK — Insisting that if the young street musician doesn't apply himself more, he'll never work his way up to a good busking spot in Times Square, local mother Rita Skolnick reportedly told her son Wednesday to "go upstairs right now" and get to practicing his buckets. "When you begged me to get you those buckets, you promised you'd practice an hour every day, and now they just sit there collecting dust," Skolnick shouted at her son Tyler, 15, pointing at a pair of white plastic buckets in the corner of his room. "You should be setting aside a solid block of time every afternoon to sit down and practice your buckets. That's the only way you're going to get better." Sources confirmed that half an hour later, Skolnick again yelled at her son when she went into his room and found him sitting on one of his buckets and playing video games.

Nation's Amateur Skateboarders Haven't Landed Trick In 12 Years
BERKELEY, CA — Having completed a long-term analysis of skateboarding activity at every skate park, public plaza, parking lot, and suburban cul-de-sac in the United States, researchers at the University of California reported this week that not one of the nation's 19 million amateur skateboarders has successfully landed a single trick since 2001. The multi-decade study, which will be published in this month's Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, found no instances in which non-professionals were able to ride on a skateboard, propel themselves and their board into the air, perform a maneuver of any sort, and then land back on the deck and continue to ride as they had before the jump. The report confirmed that not a single ollie, nollie, kickturn, heelflip, frontside 180, backside 180, or fakie has been landed in over a decade. In addition, 100 percent of handrail grinds resulted in subjects landing on their shoulders while nearby acquaintances laughed at them. "Since 2001, recreational skateboarders have tried to perform 8.4 billion tricks and have successfully executed zero of them," said social anthropologist and the report's lead author Richard Burbridge, who confirmed that the overwhelming majority of failed attempts occurred after one of the riders remarked to another, "Hey, check this out." "As it turns out, not a single amateur has landed anything since July of 2001, when a then 14-year-old boy by the name of Derek Wilcox carried out a basic ollie on an outdoor tennis court in Pasadena. And even then he didn't get much height." "Of course, our figures show that Wilcox subsequently missed his next 160,000 attempts, including 208 just last Wednesday alone," Burbridge continued. According to the study's findings, 28 percent of all amateur skateboarding stunts attempted between 2001 and 2013 resulted in the subject falling to the pavement, 23 percent involved the skateboard landing upside-down at least three feet away from the rider, 13 percent ended when the subject clipped the curb and stumbled headlong onto a lawn or sidewalk, 11 percent involved the skateboard somehow shooting back the opposite direction while the rider ran a few frantic steps forward to keep his balance, and a full one quarter concluded with the subject on the ground grimacing and holding their shin as their skateboard rolled off without them an additional 25 feet. Moreover, the study confirmed that nine of every 10 maneuvers attempted by amateur skateboarders were "not even close," and that over half the individuals observed were simply incapable of getting their skateboards off the ground at all. "What's interesting about the millions of subjects we studied is how their constant and unrelenting failure appeared to have no effect in deterring them from this behavior," researcher Lois Pittner said. "Even after a particularly inept, embarrassing, or injurious attempt, these individuals typically got right back up and horribly botched another skateboard trick. This demographic simply never improves and continues messing up tricks day after day for years on end, often quite publicly." "In fact," added Pittner, "among the recreational skateboarding cohort, the continuous inability to perform any trick at all appears to be their single most defining trait." In spite of the total lack of completed tricks, researchers noted that the past 12 years have not been uneventful, as recreational skateboarders have broken over 17 million bones, sustained 21.6 million concussions, and wound up sprawled at the bottom of a public park staircase 500 million times. Additionally, Pittner confirmed that the phrase "Dude, you almost nailed it" is uttered, on average, 875,000 times a day. When interviewed, however, the vast majority of pre-adolescent, teenage, and adult skateboarders expressed optimism at their prospects for completing a skateboarding maneuver. "I'm getting really close to being able to do a frontside grind across this bench," said Billy Lifton, 20, of Lawrence, KS, who like an estimated 98 percent of all nonprofessional skateboarders has never landed a single trick in his life. "This is going to be so sick." At press time, Lifton and an estimated 18,000 others were frantically clutching their tailbones.

Dolphin Spends Amazing Vacation Swimming With Stockbroker
ORLANDO, FL — Describing the encounter as a once-in-a-lifetime experience she'll never forget, local bottlenose dolphin Hazel reportedly recounted stories Tuesday from a recent vacation in which she got to go swimming with a stockbroker. "He was definitely shy at first, but with a little encouragement he swam right up next to me — the whole thing was so amazing," said the dolphin, appearing excited as she described her "almost spiritual" encounter with the financial executive, whom she estimated was perhaps 40 years old and weighed as much as 180 pounds. "And he was just chattering away the whole time. It's like they have their own little language. You have to wonder what's going on in their heads and whether it's true that they're almost as intelligent as we are." The dolphin added that while she ultimately enjoyed her experience, she was disappointed that she wasn't allowed to actually ride the stockbroker.

'New York Times' Reader Stoked After Noticing Article Penned By Favorite Reporting Duo
'Cha-Ching! It's Michael D. Shear And Jeremy W. Peters Time!' COLUMBIA, SC — Saying that he is always in the mood for a little Michael D. Shear/Jeremy W. Peters action, New York Times reader Mitchell Gleason was reportedly pumped Wednesday after noticing that an article about Barack Obama's judicial picks for a Washington, D.C. federal court was authored by his favorite reporting duo. "Here we go, baby! Shear and Peters in effect!" Gleason told reporters, adding that he usually counts on Michael D. Shear for his judicial reportage but that instances when correspondent Jeremy Peters teams up with him are "rare treats indeed." "The thing is, these guys balance each other out perfectly. Peters brings Shear out of his comfort zone, and Shear brings Peters down to earth. You might have a favorite — my wife's more of a Shear person, and I'm definitely a Peters guy — but when you get these two together, boom. It's like lightning in a bottle." At press time, Gleason was speculating how "fucking amazing" it would be if both teamed up to write a book about the federal justice system.

Sparrow Thinks It Might Have Caught Bird Flu After Puking Seeds All Morning
ANKENY, IA — After vomiting seeds for three straight hours this morning, a local sparrow told reporters it is worried it might have contracted the deadly H7N9 avian influenza. "I told my warbler friend whose buddy got bird flu recently, and he was like, 'Ken, relax, it's not bird flu — you just ate some bad seeds,' but still, I'm kind of freaked out," said the concerned passer domesticus, adding that it's pretty sure it is exhibiting at least a few of the major symptoms related to the treatment-resistant illness spreading throughout the Hunan province. "As soon as I left the nest this morning, I felt like total shit. Five minutes later, I'm puking all my seeds up. I don't even have any more seeds left to puke — I'm just dry heaving from my beak now." The sparrow then told reporters it would try to get some thistle in its stomach and hope its condition doesn't get worse.

Woman At Supermarket Imagines Entire Narrative Where Bagger Is Happy With Life
CINCINNATI — While checking out at the local Shoprite Monday, customer Lauren Connors, 36, reportedly concocted an entire narrative in which the man who was bagging her groceries enjoys his job and is content with his life. "I bet he takes a lot of pride in knowing exactly what products to put together in each bag, and I wouldn't be surprised if he thinks it's really cool how each customer's groceries present a new challenge," Connors thought as she watched the expressionless worker place her $68.38 purchase into three brown paper bags. "This probably isn't what he wants to do with the rest of his life, but he's happy with where he is now, he likes helping people, and that's great. He could probably make more money or do something else whenever he wanted. No rush, though." "He's got his life figured out," she added. "He's fine." While she swiped her credit card and noticed the man in his early 30s delicately placing her eggs into an empty bag, reports confirm that Connors' theoretical narrative became more fleshed out, with the buyer figuring that the grocery store clerk probably doesn't even want to be sitting in an office from 9 to 5 anyway, and enjoys being on his feet and exchanging pleasantries with customers in a brightly lit supermarket. As the grocery store employee asked in a monotone voice whether Connors wanted her groceries double- or single-bagged, she reportedly went on to think about how the man more than likely enjoys how stress-free his job is, and probably pities "working-class stiffs" who maybe have higher-paying jobs but stress about trivial things like repainting the living room or buying a third car. In addition, Connors was certain the employee has a girlfriend whom he adores and who adores him and who is the only thing that truly matters to him in this world. "The great thing is that he isn't defined by his job and has tons of outside interests," the woman thought, adding an imagined story wrinkle wherein the grocery store bagger happily high-fives his manager — with whom he has a great relationship — when his shift ends every night. "On weekends he goes camping and kayaks. Or he reads. He's content just reading a book. That's if he's not watching sports with his friends or his family. He has a very close, loving relationship with his parents, who support him no matter what." "I'm glad he has all that love around him," the woman mentally noted. Sources confirmed that when the woman asked the bagger to keep the milk separate from the fruit, and the bagger proceeded to stare at her for an extra second and then nod, Connors thought about how he probably makes decent enough money and is saving a little bit every month to put a down payment on a house or maybe even go back to school for engineering, writing, or one of his many other interests. After signing her receipt and telling the bagger thank you, Connors reportedly exited the store happy that the bagger was in such a good place in his life and ready for whatever the future held should an opportunity arise. "Single- or double-bagged?" the bagger asked the next customer in line.

Ceiling Fan Transforms Apartment Without Air Conditioning Into Frosty Wonderland
NEW YORK — According to 27-year-old Alex Wilson, the five-blade ceiling fan in his apartment's common room is making the two-bedroom living space a veritable winter wonderland, providing him with an enchanting arctic sanctuary from the triple-digit temperatures outside. "Brrr, it's like Christmas in here!" Wilson said as the ceiling fan oscillated above, its icy vortex of wind making the fifth-floor apartment feel as chilly as a midwinter's day. "If anything, it's too cold. What if I don't have enough blankets to keep me warm at night?" At press time, Wilson was making some hot cocoa and settling in to watch Miracle On 34th Street.

Teen Boulder Can't Wait For Landslide To Roll It Into Ravine Where They Get It
SALIDA, CO — Saying that he's sick of his native mountainous escarpment and tired of being surrounded by "a bunch of squares," a local teen boulder revealed Monday that it desperately wants to roll down into a nearby ravine where they actually get it. "The rocks and shrubs in the ravine below — they know the deal," the adolescent stone told reporters, explaining that the boulders on the upper crags of its cliff face "seriously don't have a clue." "Down there, they get who I am and what I'm all about. Not like the losers up here." The boulder went on to claim that it couldn't take its current surroundings much longer and would definitely roll down into the ravine after "another 500 or 600 years of erosion, tops."

Pit Of Komodo Dragons Shocked To Discover Billionaire Who Owns Them Is Just 26
NEW YORK — While lying dormant in their 12-foot-deep, climate-controlled pit earlier this morning, the nine Komodo dragons recently purchased by local billionaire Kyle Edmunds were stunned to discover that the obscenely wealthy magnate who owns them is just 26 years old. "I guess I always assumed we were the novelty pets of some old, eccentric oil tycoon type, but apparently, this Kyle kid was born in fucking 1987," said one member of the surprised pack of Indonesian monitor lizards, adding that he couldn't believe they were the fanciful, spectacularly expensive whim of "some twerp in his mid-20s." "He and his dork friends made some sort of app in college, I guess, and now he has a giant pit filled with Komodo dragons in his mansion. I mean, I thought we belonged to, like, Warren Buffet, or at least some crazed South American drug lord. But this kid?" At press time, the Komodo dragons were reportedly devouring the large carcass of a young water buffalo while shaking their heads and muttering, "The guy's name is Kyle, for Christ's sake."

PEORIA, IL — In keeping with the pair's time-honored yearly tradition, local resident Bruce Malden reportedly made it through a "smooth and uneventful" six-sentence exchange with cousin Jeanelle Fowler at his family's annual reunion last weekend. "Hey, how have you been?" Malden said to his cousin, who according to sources answered without hesitation that she had, in fact, been doing fine. "Doing pretty good myself. Can't complain, anyway. You still liking it out there in Seattle?" Reports later confirmed that the fifth and sixth sentences spoken by Malden consisted of the single-word responses "Good" and "Uh-huh," respectively.

Area Man Growing A Little Tired Of Rushing Home To Hug Loved Ones
ST. LOUIS — Following the deadly explosions Monday that rocked the city of Boston, area man Tom Sifton told reporters he's getting pretty tired of frantically rushing home from work as fast as he possibly can to hug his loved ones tight. "I realize that desperately racing home to my wife and kids so I can hold them and tell them I love them is part of the routine now and I need to get used to it, but sometimes I just don't know if I have another one in me," the haggard 47-year-old said after clutching his children and telling them that everything will be all right as tears welled up in his eyes. "I used to have to do this kind of thing maybe once a year, at most, but now it seems like every couple of weeks I'm rushing home to hug my family, be thankful they weren't the ones killed in a horrific shooting or bombing, and assure them I will always be there to protect them and keep them safe. Man, it gets exhausting." At press time, Sifton was telling his children something like this would never happen again, a practice he has mastered over the past six months.

Mom Breaks Into Son's Apartment At Night To Administer 2013 Flu Vaccine
EXETER, RI — After leaving multiple phone and email messages reminding her son Josh, 28, to schedule an appointment with his doctor for his seasonal flu shot, area mom Kathleen Warner broke into his apartment in the dead of night Sunday and administered the 2013 flu vaccine herself, sources reported. "I warned you," the 58-year-old woman reportedly whispered to her son through a black ski mask as she flicked the tip of the needle, pumped the syringe two times, and jabbed it into his arm. "I told you to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician. I even sent you a list of local flu clinics in your area. But you wouldn't listen. Now we're doing things my way." Sources confirmed that after administering the vaccine and exiting her son's room, Warner quickly tidied up the bathroom before slipping out the back door.

Insecure, Frustrated Bully With Something To Prove Considering Career In Law Enforcement
RALEIGH, NC — Calling it his lifelong dream, local man Brendan Lockhart, an insecure and perpetually frustrated bully who believes he has something to prove to the world, told reporters Thursday that he is seriously considering a career in law enforcement. Lockhart, a recent high-school graduate who sources confirmed is plagued by resentment, self-doubt, unexpected fits of rage, and has always had a penchant for tormenting those who are smaller and weaker than him, explained that he feels he is well suited to serve as a police officer. "I've always wanted to be a cop," said Lockhart, whose paranoia and inferiority complex constantly haunt him, leading him to lash out at others in order to convince them he is in control. "I know it's a tough line of work, but I think I've got what it takes to earn my shield and get out there and keep the peace." "This is the job I was born to do," continued the man whose main goal in life is to prove to others that he is strong, confident, and not afraid. Friends and family confirmed that Lockhart, an unpredictable, petty individual who frequently loses his temper when he feels he is being threatened or disrespected, has in recent months been inquiring into joining the ranks of the Raleigh Police Department. In this role, the man with a massive chip on his shoulder and no visible sense of empathy would be tasked with peacefully resolving disputes and evenhandedly administering justice to members of the community over whom he would have official power. Specifically, sources speculated that should Lockhart successfully complete the 17-week officer training program and cursory psychological examination necessary to become a cop, the 18-year-old, who suffers from feelings of inadequacy and frequently explodes in emotional outbursts against people he perceives to be mocking him, would on a daily basis be placed in delicate situations requiring extreme patience and sound judgment. "My dad's encouraging me to go to the academy, and he says that once I graduate I can probably get a job around here," said Lockhart, referring to the man whose own lack of compassion and propensity for inexplicable violence is largely to blame for similar patterns in his son, and who is himself a veteran police officer. "Once I'm a cop, I'm going to do what I have to do to make sure these neighborhoods stay safe." "I bet a lot of people don't think I can do it, but I'll show them," continued the man who could in six months' time possess both a standard-issue firearm and the city-sanctioned authority to unholster and fire the weapon. When pressed for further comment, sources close to the man who hopes to play an active role in protecting his community confirmed that Lockhart constantly goes out of his way to intimidate and belittle those people he knows are too submissive to fight back. The 18-year-old often fantasizes at length about getting revenge on those he believes have wronged him. When frustrated or enraged with his own general powerlessness in the world, he reportedly has a tendency to take out these emotions on the first person he comes across, with little or no provocation. Lockhart routinely gets in screaming arguments with others and must be physically restrained as his anger reaches a white-hot pitch, frightening all around him. A devoted fan of mixed martial arts, Lockhart is capable of watching YouTube videos of people being pummeled senselessly for hours at a time. Sources also felt it bears mentioning that Lockhart is an impassioned and unapologetic racist. When asked to outline his motivations for entering the field of law enforcement, the perpetually infuriated bully who could very soon be responsible for the security and well-being of thousands of innocent people explained that he feels a personal obligation to do whatever necessary to safeguard society. "There's a lot of bad people out there who think they can get away with doing whatever they want, and someone has to stop them," said Lockhart, his hands unconsciously closing into tight fists. "So if I don't step up and show everyone who's boss, who will?" "Plus, I've been talking to my buddies at the gym, and a bunch of them are gonna be cops too," Lockhart continued. "It'll be great."

PALMDALE, CA — With one hand on the wheel and the other turning up a radio blasting Black Flag's "Rise Above," the drunk 17-year-old currently driving a convertible at 100 miles per hour down a slippery patch of California State Route 138 is utterly invincible, sources have confirmed. "Nothing can stop me — I'm going to live forever!" slurred the fast-living, indestructible teen, swerving his father's BMW through the torrential rain and accelerating down the winding mountain highway. "I'll be young forever, too. 'Cause I play by my own set of rules." The immortal being then reportedly sneered as he locked eyes with his own reflection in the rearview mirror, pressed harder on the gas, and approached a sharp bend in the road.

Pool Owner Has Bathing Suit That Touched His Penis You Can Borrow
CHERRY HILL, NJ — Upon learning that you cannot go swimming with everyone else because you left your bathing suit at home, local pool owner Gary McGill, 41, offered to loan you some swim trunks that have touched his penis countless times, sources confirmed Tuesday. "Oh, don't worry about it — out in the pool house I've got an extra pair whose thin, absorbent netting has tightly cupped my genitalia on many occasions," said McGill, adding that he had been lending the swimsuit out to guests all summer and that it was really no trouble at all. "Yep, go in there and look for the orange ones that always cling to my wet, bare ass and have to be peeled off when I'm done. They've been rubbing right up against my penis and the penises of several other people for the past two months. I'll see you in the pool, buddy!" At press time, reports confirmed you had chosen to go swimming with your groin enmeshed in a garment full of someone else's scrotal skin cells.

After One Realizes Methadone Clinic Nearby, Behavior Around City Block Makes Sense
NEW YORK — Though he was once confused by the number of frail, seemingly mentally unstable people concentrated around the Houston and Broadway area of Manhattan, local man Paul Nichols, 38, told reporters Monday that as soon as he figured out there was a methadone clinic nearby, that pretty much explained everything. "Oh, I get it now," said Nichols, who, during his walk to work, used to wonder why he would regularly see comatose-looking individuals holding cigarettes and murmuring to themselves. "Makes sense." After learning of the methadone clinic, Nichols reportedly told his coworkers, who then nodded and said they thought that might be what was going on there.

NYPD Lets Suspicious Man Go After Only Finding 'Catcher In The Rye' In Backpack
NEW YORK — Responding to several calls regarding a suspicious-looking individual lurking outside a Midtown office building, police released a man today after finding only a copy of J.D. Salinger's 1951 novel The Catcher In The Rye in his backpack, sources report. "We had received complaints of an individual with a strange look in his eyes loitering near the building, but fortunately a search of the man's backpack yielded nothing more than some old book," said Officer Pete Silvani, referring to the man's dog-eared copy of Salinger's seminal work that reportedly contained hundreds of annotations, drawings, and frequent highlighting of the words "children" and "innocence." "In light of this, we determined that he posed no threat to the public and, per his request, directed him to the nearest hardware store." At press time, the suspicious man was seen rapidly approaching actor Greg Kinnear.

Cat Looking Out Window, Bird Form Unbelievably Intense Fifth-Of-A-Second Bond
ADRIAN, MI — An extremely intense bond that lasted just 0.2 seconds, but which was filled with a range of deeply intertwined and conflicting emotions that included fear, hunger, curiosity, rage, and even — on some level — love, was reportedly felt Monday between Lionel, a tabby housecat, and a pine warbler. The brief, silent connection, described to reporters as an overwhelming, almost spiritual experience for both animals, almost as if everything in their short lives had been cosmically leading up to this very encounter, formed when Lionel, seated in his usual spot near the kitchen window, instinctually moved his head rapidly to the left and spotted the bird coming to rest on the patio table. During the milliseconds the two species locked eyes, age-old genetic impulses of survival were reportedly unlocked and the two animals were suddenly frozen in time, enveloped by the most primal and elemental forces of nature. According to witness accounts, at the height of their ever-so-short but fathomless bond, the cat and bird truly believed they were the only two living things in the entire universe, gripped by an almost paralyzing sense of yearning. The unexplained connection, which sources confirmed was as awesome, mighty, and holy as God Himself, ended as soon as it began when the warbler flew away and Lionel scratched his ear and lay down.

Family Watches In Silence As Dad Checks Out Waitress
CLEVELAND — Struggling not to openly show discomfort, family members dining with local man Louis Munson sat quietly on Sunday as Munson peered intently in the direction of Olive Garden waitress Layla Martinez. Munson, who first noticed the 23-year-old brunette as she walked past carrying another table's pasta entrees, reportedly gazed at her for approximately 12 seconds, lingering on certain features of her anatomy while his fully aware wife, two sons, and daughter watched in silence. Though the family's unease had largely passed by the end of the meal, sources say it was re-sparked when Munson suddenly noticed Martinez from across the restaurant bending down to tie her shoe.

"Ha," Perrett reportedly chuckled to himself, confidently and unabashedly, before raising the volume on a YouTube video titled "Man wipes out on scooter," right there in the middle of a telephone conference with corporate. "That's hilarious." According to sources, Perrett then loudly called for a coworker in the next room to "come check this out."

Man Misses Simple Pleasure Of Going To Movie Store, Browsing For Something, Being Told It's Out, Driving Home
FAYETTEVILLE, AR — Shortly after streaming a movie through his Netflix account earlier today, local man Brian Larson, 32, fondly recalled a simpler, more joyful time when he would go to his local video rental store, browse for a particular movie, find out it wasn't available, and then drive home and find something else to do. "It was just a different experience walking into a cozy, independently run store and having someone tell you, sorry, they just rented out the last copy of the movie you really wanted to watch," said Larson, adding that while he fully appreciated being able to immediately watch virtually any movie title on his laptop, he "occasionally misses" his Friday night routine of driving to a video store and then driving back home in disappointment 10 minutes later after failing to secure one of the store's five copies of a new release. "Sometimes you could even see special recommendations made by video store employees, only to realize they don't have any copies of those movies left either. It's just the type of experience you'll never get online." At press time, Larson's pangs of nostalgia were somewhat fulfilled when he found out the 2006 film The Prestige was not available to be streamed.

High School Freshman Thinks 'Romeo And Juliet' Might Just Be Her Favorite Play
EL PASO, TX — Praising its characters, story, and ending, Maya Brown, a freshman at DeSoto High School, decided this Monday that William Shakespeare's classic Romeo And Juliet might just be her favorite play. "I love how romantic it is, and especially how well the dialogue is written," said the 15-year-old, whose knowledge of theater and the dramatic arts reportedly dates back to the fall of 2012. "Shakespeare is just such an amazing playwright. He's probably one of the best in history." Brown added that if she were ever in a production of Romeo And Juliet, she would want to play Juliet.

Social Media Rock Star Makes $28,000 Per Year
MARIETTA, GA — Widely regarded as one of the online world's brightest personalities, sources confirmed Friday that famed 28-year-old social media rock star Ryan Wasserman, better known as @RWthinks by his legions of passionate fans, makes roughly $28,000 per year. Wasserman, who for the last three years has worked as an administrative assistant at KPL Insurance Group, has reportedly amassed over 250,000 rabid followers since first taking Twitter by storm in 2009 and has since blown up into one of the most prominent and popular voices in the social media sphere. "I try to add something new to the conversation with every post," said Wasserman, who sources claim totally kills it with his tweets day in, day out and receives absolutely no benefits from his employer. "My followers expect the best, and I take that as a responsibility to always give them something to really think about." "I'm constantly pushing the boundaries with my tweets," added the man who makes approximately $1,600 per month after taxes and has not made a student loan payment in over two years. "I started a Tumblr a few months ago too, because sometimes 140 characters just doesn't cut it for what I need to say." According to sources, Wasserman receives over 300 retweets and 400 favorites on each of the roughly 30 tweets he posts daily. The universally proclaimed "Twitter luminary" also reportedly attracts hundreds of new followers every week and has a $1,000 monthly credit limit on his VISA card. "I post about all sorts of things — news, politics, music, movies, and just plain old everyday stuff," said the big-time social media hotshot who rides the bus to and from work every day. "I'm happy that what I write resonates so deeply with people, but I try not to get too wrapped up in all the Twitter mentions and 'Follow Friday' shout-outs. I'm always thinking about my next post." Wasserman's every move is said to be fawned over by his rapidly growing base of supporters, all of whom voraciously read anything the social media sensation posts in his downtime between collating photocopies, filing payroll forms, and brewing coffee for his boss. "I check RWthinks' feed every day because that guy is basically the king of the Internet," 31-year-old Twitter user Daniel Parker said of the man who has $900 in his checking account. "I remember when he favorited my reply to one of his tweets, and I was just so excited. I can't believe he even read it, with all the replies he gets." "I started following him on Instagram too, and the guy just lights it up nonstop wherever he goes," Parker continued. "I don't know how he does it. He's just all over the place." Sources confirmed that Wasserman, who is paid $13 per hour and is not eligible for overtime, appears regularly on the FavStar daily leaderboard and is frequently featured in "Must Follow" lists from the Huffington Post, CNN, and TIME. Influential Twitter users such as musician Questlove, actress Olivia Wilde, Mashable founder Pete Cashmore, and NBA star Blake Griffin also follow Wasserman's tweets, which the high-profile social media icon reportedly writes on the iPhone his parents bought him and still keep on their family plan. Moreover, experts say the swift ascent of the 28-year-old entry-level employee into the upper echelons of internet superstardom is showing no signs of slowing down. "There's no two ways about it: Ryan Wasserman owns social media right now," said Gawker social media analyst Haley Iacona, noting that the internet phenom, who pays $650 per month to share a two-bedroom apartment with a 23-year-old he met through Craigslist, has built a far-reaching and fervid global audience. "He's an absolute Twitter machine. He just has his finger on the pulse like nobody else out there right now. One retweet from him and you're guaranteed to get at least a few hundred more followers." At press time, sources confirmed Wasserman was sitting on his full-sized futon purchased from a used furniture store, watching the retweets pour in as his latest Twitter post went viral.

Fantasized Argument Getting Pretty Intense
BELMONT, MA­­ — Escalating over the course of 20 minutes from a restrained discussion with a coworker to a heated confrontation between multiple members of his management team, the fantasized argument currently taking place in the mind of Digital Ventures, Inc. employee Jesse Newman is getting pretty intense, sources confirmed today. "You're talking to me about incompetence? Me?" Newman said in his mind while furrowing his brow and letting the entirely fictitious dispute go to an increasingly frank and emotionally charged place. "Mark, no one in this room agrees with you. Why? Because they don't respect you. And they never have. And if you honestly believe that what you do around here is in any way vital, or important, or irreplaceable, then you are out of your mind. Absolutely out of your mind. No…you made it personal by insinuating that I wasn't up to the task." At press time, a blood vessel was just becoming visible on Newman's temple.

Asian Guy Has Separate Group Of Just Asian Friends
AUSTIN, TX — Local resident Ted Cho has two separate groups of friends, one of which only has Asians in it, the 25-year-old software developer's non-Asian friends reported Tuesday. "He has the group of friends I'm in — mostly people he knows from work or college — but then he has this whole other set of just Asian friends we've never hung out with for some reason," said coworker Bruce Hollis, 26, noting that Cho is frequently seen in Facebook photos having dinner or drinks with four or five Asian people their age whom Hollis never sees in person. "Sometimes when we invite him out he already has plans with his Asian friends, and we'll suggest he bring them along. He'll say, 'Yeah, maybe we can meet up later,' but somehow it never happens." Hollis added that the one time he bumped into Cho with his Asian friends they were all speaking English, so he really doesn't see what the big deal is.

Depraved Masochist Enjoys Following The News
CALDWELL, ID — Calling it a vital part of his daily routine, local man and utterly depraved masochist Richard Petrillo revealed to reporters Friday that he enjoys keeping up with the news. The sick man, who confirmed that he makes a concerted effort to follow all manner of current events, evidently derives pleasure from torturing himself in this way, saying he likes to know as much as possible about the world in which he lives. "There's a lot going on these days, and I like to stay on top of things," Petrillo said of his disturbing desire to follow news stories, including those about the Middle East, the state of the U.S. economy, and the recent activities of the National Security Agency. "With such a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips, it just makes sense to keep abreast of the latest developments." "It's important to stay informed, you know?" the degenerate continued while perusing a news website. "Oh, look, here's an update on what's happening in Somalia." According to those close to Petrillo, the 36-year-old web designer devotes several hours each week to this vile form of self-abuse. He reportedly indulges his twisted obsession by seeking out news articles and videos on everything from politics and international affairs to health care and the environment — often multiple times a day. In the past, sources said, Petrillo only gratified this unsettling need for punishment in the privacy of his own home, where he consults the internet, television, and various news magazines to find out about the world's most pressing issues. Now, however, he often engages in his perverse behavior publicly, using a smartphone to see what's currently happening in Syria, Egypt, Greece, Russia, and even North Korea. "I follow a lot of major news outlets on Twitter so I can check in throughout the day and catch all the updates," said Petrillo, who reportedly can't go half an hour without reading the latest headlines, all of which contain explicit details about what is actually happening in the world at this moment, details that sources confirmed only a human being with a sick, psychosexual enjoyment of pain and suffering could possibly derive gratification from. "But on the other hand, I'll sit in the evening with a copy of The New Yorker and read an in-depth article on the situation in Lebanon." "I guess you could say I'm a bit of a news junkie," added the individual who can apparently read about millions of displaced Syrians before bed and still manage to sleep. Petrillo went on to add that he enjoys spending his Sunday mornings drinking coffee and reading the newspaper, presumably a horrifying and painful act, yet also a "favorite weekend ritual" that the deviant man seems to get off on. Sources confirmed that Petrillo makes no effort whatsoever to conceal his insatiable desire for self-inflicted torment, going so far as to take pride in his familiarity with issues such as America's distribution of wealth, the latest jobs report, what's happening in Congress recently, and the nation's current incarceration rate. In fact, he is reportedly not content with simple masochism, and often spreads the anguish of his knowledge to his fellow citizens. "Whenever I come across an interesting article online, I like to email it to my friends and try to get a conversation going," said Petrillo, his voice betraying no shame. "For example, a while back I sent around a story about how hundreds of Rohingya Muslims have been [omitted for sake of decency] by the Myanmar government. It's really important stuff, but there's just not much awareness of the issue." "I love finding something like that and sharing it with people," the sicko added. "I really do."

Friends Don't Understand How Man Not Depressed
GARDEN GROVE, FL — Citing factors such as his low-paying job, lack of foreseeable prospects, and modest living conditions, sources close to local resident Karl Brewster said Thursday they are at a loss to explain his day-to-day cheerfulness in the face of such a bleak existence. "On paper, he's a loser with no realistic escape from his ordeal, but for some reason he's smiling all the time," longtime friend Peter Gunderson said of the 32-year-old man who is reportedly consumed by neither self-hatred nor feelings of hopelessness. "How does he even get out of bed in the morning? I get depressed just walking into that dimly lit studio apartment of his." Brewster's brother Mitch agreed: "For a guy who lives alone and walks dogs for a living, he's way, way too happy. Things are going much better for me than they are for him, and I'm a nonstop wreck." While admitting Brewster has never once mentioned seeking the help of a mental health professional, friends said the only logical explanation is that he must have the absolute best therapist on the planet.

"Man oh man, Uncle Jack totally whiffed it on that one," Kyle's brother Jason said of the humiliating gift attempt, in which the 48-year-old bit it big time with his present of Lost And Philosophy: The Island Has Its Reasons, a 2007 book of essays exploring the themes of the ABC series Lost through a philosophical lens. "Hey, the big man took a risk, doubled down, and went bust. What are you gonna do?" Sources confirmed that Uncle Mark totally knocked it out of the park with a gift card to Best Buy.

Call From Daycare Can't Be Good
HARRISBURG, PA — Speculating that the rest of her day will now definitely take a turn for the worse, local mother Nicole Mendlow confirmed Friday that an incoming call she is currently receiving from her 4-year-old son's daycare center can't possibly be good. "Well, this is going to be rough," Mendlow said while staring at the nursery school's phone number flashing across her iPhone screen. "It's not like they call you in the middle of the day to say your child is doing great. Either he hit another kid, they can't find him, or he's hurt." At press time, sources confirmed that, Christ, it was even worse than Mendlow thought.

Well, Neighbors Just Got A Pit Bull
SPRINGFIELD, MA — Initial reports from your back porch confirmed Sunday that, yep, the couple next door just got a pit bull. Witnesses said one of its ears appears to have been bitten off and the animal has scars all over its muzzle, indications that, wouldn't you know it, this is probably one of those rescue dogs that was thoroughly abused by its previous owner. There it goes, sources stated, just growling and barking away. And jumping. The pit bull can reportedly jump really high, clamp its jaws down on a dangling piece of knotted rope, and just hang there, snarling. According to sources, a low hedge is all that separates the animal from your backyard, which, sure enough, is where your three small children play all the time. Oh, here we go, the reports continued, your neighbor is apparently coming over to tell you there are a lot of misconceptions about these dogs. They're only as bad as their owners, he says. Well, at least they only got one pit — oh, nope, there's a second one coming out of the house. How about that, sources said. Two pit bulls, and they're really starting to go at each other, aren't they? Witnesses later confirmed that, Christ, they're just going to leave the two dogs untethered in the backyard while they go out for the night.

Heat Wave Doesn't Bother Local Contrarian
CHICAGO — Despite broiling temperatures that have plagued the residents of the Midwest and much of the Eastern Seaboard throughout the week, local man and lifelong contrarian Martin Rivers told reporters Thursday that the ongoing heat wave does not in fact bother him. "Everyone's been complaining about the weather lately, but I've always liked when it gets nice and hot like this," the aggressively contrary man said of the recent surge of intense heat and humidity that has seen temperatures climb well into the 90s, adding that "it feels good to sweat." "I like distinct seasons, you know, and I think it's nice to have weather extremes every once in a while. I mean, it's summer; what do you expect?" At press time, those close to Rivers had confirmed that the nonconforming individual was loudly airing his hopes that the intense heat would continue through the weekend.

Local Mosque Only Rated 1.5 Stars On Yelp
DES MOINES, IA — With complaints about everything from "raggedy prayer mats" to "the grimiest ablution fountain ever," local Muslims have slammed the al-Wali Mosque on 14th Street as "the worst of the worst," giving it an average review of 1.5 stars on the website Yelp. "Frankly, this place is a dump — between the poor lighting, the overall dirtiness, and the crowds, it's almost impossible to concentrate on anything pure or holy," user Faruq43 wrote in a scathing review posted this week, claiming that he once even had his shoes stolen from the mosque when he removed them for Friday prayers. "On top of that, it doesn't even face Mecca. Seriously! According to my iPhone, it's at least 10 degrees off. I now drive an extra half hour to the masjid in Ames just to avoid this place." According to congregants, the place of worship's only five-star review, an unqualified rave, was almost certainly posted by the mosque's imam.

NEW YORK — Following a year of fruitless efforts to find a job, unemployed 26-year-old Scott Wesley, who reportedly lives off a $2 million trust fund established by his parents, confirmed Thursday he "still has enough in savings" to make ends meet for the time being. "The job market's tough right now, but thankfully I have some money put away in my savings account," said Wesley, apparently referring to the professionally managed investment fund to which his parents have been the sole contributors since his birth. "Obviously, living off your savings isn't ideal, but I'm not too worried. I've been through rough stretches before, and somehow in the end I'm always able to find enough to cover all my expenses." At press time, sources confirmed the man's parents had just deposited $30,000 into his checking account.

LOS ANGELES — A full week into his infiltration of the East Side Crips, no member of the gang can bear to tell confidential police informant Hiram Loudon that his cover was blown roughly a day and a half after his recruitment, sources within the organization revealed Tuesday. "We've been on to him for weeks, but the poor guy's trying so hard, we just don't have the heart to break it to him," said street soldier Dwight Allwood, who acknowledged he should have killed Loudon immediately the first time he noticed a wire poking from the informant's jeans pocket but "just couldn't bring myself to do it." "He's a sweetheart of a guy, and he's clearly dedicated to what he's doing — he learned all our gang signs and nicknames and everything. It's going to be devastating for him when he realizes he's been found out." Admitting he has grown fond of the informant, Allwood said that when the time comes, he will probably shoot Loudon in the back of the head to avoid watching as the man's face is blown off.

Man Freely Smoking Pot in Washington Literally Has No Issue He Feels Strongly About Anymore
SEATTLE — Celebrating the new law in Washington state that allows him to freely smoke marijuana within his home, local man Erik Cirrone, 25, told reporters Thursday there is no longer any political or social issue he feels strongly about in any way whatsoever. "Yeah, the right to smoke marijuana legally was pretty much the only thing even remotely tying me to events going on in the world," said Cirrone, who unreservedly took a drag from a joint before adding that he does not have an impassioned stance, or any stance at all, on topics such as the economy, health care, gay rights, unemployment, Gaza, global warming, or any other major domestic or international matter. "I used to consider myself pretty political before this law was passed, but now I realize this was actually the one and only political issue I cared about. Don't really give a shit about anything else, frankly." At press time, Cirrone was smoking pot.

Barber Just Latest In String Of Humans To Feign Interest In What Area Man Says
BLANCHESTER, OH — Sources confirmed Friday that the person currently cutting local man Russell Elko's hair is merely the latest in a long line of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of human beings who over the course of the 30-year-old's lifetime have pretended to be interested in what he says. "Really? Huh, I hadn't realized that," said the barber, absentmindedly nodding his head in much the same way Elko's officemate, his most recent girlfriend, his second-grade teacher, the man who sold him coffee this morning, his primary-care physician, his childhood babysitter, and the OB-GYN who assisted in his birth have also done. "Well, I'm glad to hear it." Reached for comment, Elko said the lack of interest makes sense, as he, too, is often completely bored with what he has to say.

Asshole From Plane Greeted At Baggage Claim By Whole Family
ATLANTA — Following their arrival at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport Friday, passengers from flight 3852 confirmed that the loud, obnoxious prick who had been seated in row 12 was warmly greeted and embraced by his whole family at the terminal's baggage claim. "That guy wouldn't shut up about how slow the drink service was, and he spent the whole flight sticking his elbows and legs out into the aisle and over into the seat next to him," said fellow passenger Carla Moreau, who noted that, after exiting the gate area, two elementary-school-age girls cried out "Daddy" and ran to hug the man who had pressed the overhead flight attendant call button several times in rapid succession shortly after takeoff to demand a gin and tonic. "Before we even got on the plane, he was pushing past people in line at the gate. And he had to be tapped on the shoulder about five or six times before he moved his seat-back up for landing, and when he finally did, he sighed loud enough for everyone to hear. God, what a dick. Cute family, though." At press time, the obnoxious asshole and his entire asshole family were refusing to move out of the way of those attempting to retrieve their luggage from the baggage carousel.

College Freshman's Roommate Has Had Excuse To Go Home Every Weekend Since August
BLOOMINGTON, IN — Citing various family emergencies, last-minute weddings, and impromptu hometown gatherings, the roommate of Indiana University freshman Lawrence Plotnick has had an excuse to go home every weekend this academic year, according to campus reports. "At first it was just run-of-the-mill stuff like wanting to go home to see a friend or a football game, but at this point he's already headed back for nine birthday parties, three family reunions, and five fishing trips," Plotnick said Tuesday of his fellow freshman, whom he has reportedly spoken with for no more than one cumulative hour since first meeting him in August. "And last weekend he went to his aunt and uncle's anniversary. Do you really need to go home for something like that? Still, I feel sorry for a guy who's had to attend funerals for three grandparents in the past month." Sources said that while he had no pressing need to go home this coming weekend, Plotnick's roommate had decided to make the trip anyway, explaining that it had been way too long since he'd seen his parents.

Horribly Depressed Zookeeper Has Always Had Special Connection With Animals
TULSA, OK — Saying that he has always perceived a "unique connection," chronically depressed zookeeper Andrew Holcomb, 46, told reporters Wednesday that he shares a deep and special bond with the animals confined in his zoo. Holcomb, a senior caretaker at the Tulsa Zoo, explained that he feels an innate kinship with the captive creatures under his watch, a tie that is said to have only strengthened with his increasingly frequent and crippling bouts of melancholy, low affect, and disenchantment with the world around him. "I've always felt very close to the animals here," said the depressive, who spends the vast majority of his time moving in a pitifully small radius between his home and workplace. "I feel a renewed connection with them each morning when I come in and see them pacing endlessly back and forth in their cages or sitting in the same corner of their enclosure that I last saw them in the night before. It's like we understand one another on some deeper level." "We just seem to get each other," Holcomb added, staring back at reporters with downtrodden, lifeless eyes. The clinically depressed Holcomb — whose existence is reportedly marked by a dreary cycle of purposelessly milling about, eating the same packaged lunch day in and day out, and sleeping for as long as 12 hours a night — said that he has always felt most comfortable in the presence of the mammals, birds, and reptiles at his zoo. The despondent and aimless animal caretaker, who reportedly has spent his entire professional career within the confines of the Tulsa Zoo, says that he sees in the wildlife park's attractions "a certain something" that especially resonates with him. The man whose utterly unfulfilling social life consists of lethargic interactions with the same five coworkers acknowledged feeling a uniquely strong connection with certain animals in particular, as he gestured toward a small group of western lowland gorillas listlessly slumping on the other side of a Plexiglas divider. "The great apes really speak to me on almost a spiritual level, I'd say," said the mentally unwell man, who occasionally suffers panic attacks that cause him to pound his fists in helpless rage on the countertop in his small ranch house. "It's almost as if we're on the same wavelength. There's a real link between us." The zookeeper, whose profound anxiety and mood disorders have left him socially isolated, poorly nourished, and have caused him to steadily lose his hair, admitted that while he appreciates the special bond he feels with the animals in the zoo's enclosures, he often considers other paths his life could have taken if he had not been recruited by the zoo and settled in Tulsa two decades ago. In spite of such frequent daydreams of life outside the park, the perpetually downcast zookeeper admitted that working in the same place day in and day out is all he knows anymore, and that, at this point, he has become resigned to the idea that he will stay at the facility for the rest of his working life. A number of individuals who have observed Holcomb at the zoo confirmed his deeply depressed state, noting that the middle-aged man appeared visibly forlorn and acquiescent to his condition. "I see Andrew once in a while wandering around the grounds," said concessionaire Janine Stack, who claimed the zookeeper always appeared poorly groomed and seemed to be missing a certain "spark" or liveliness that one might expect of a zoologist in the field. "He seems so sullen and doesn't look particularly healthy — you really can't help but stare at him." "Whenever I see him, I feel a little bad for the way his life has gone," she added. "But then I just move on and put him out of my mind altogether."

Heartbreaking Yelp Review Says It's Just Nice To Eat A Meal Around Other People
SOUTH BEND, IN — In an exceedingly depressing review posted Monday on the popular website Yelp, a user identified as Gregg4 gave five stars to local diner Gullifty's solely on the basis of it being a "place where you can go to eat a meal around folks who are talking and laughing." "Sometimes it's just nice to hear another person's voice, you know?" the post read in part, lauding the eatery both for having patrons and for maintaining an atmosphere in which one can overhear them discussing their day. "At Gullifty's, I can enjoy a plate of food and know I'll never be seated too far away from a family or group of friends enjoying each other's company. It's best before 8 p.m., though, because after that the customers are gone and the staff is trying to clean up. You can still talk to them, but they usually don't say much back." Earlier this month, Gregg4 posted a scathing one-star review of a Chinese takeout restaurant, warning users that the delivery boy only mumbles a few words, and that once he leaves "you're all alone again."

Mother Who Forgot To Pay 29-Year-Old Son's Phone Bill Reminded To Really Be Careful About That
BROOKLYN, NY — After discovering his mother had failed to pay his phone bill from last month, local resident Cormac Flannigan, 29, reminded her Tuesday to "try to be more careful" and "make a point of remembering to do that going forward," family sources confirmed. "I need my phone, I use it all the time, and I don't want to keep getting these annoying messages saying you haven't paid the bill yet," said Flannigan, speaking into the third iPhone his mother has purchased for him in the past five years. "I'm not mad, Mom, but you need to stay on top of this, okay? I don't want to have to remind you every month." Sources added that Flannigan, who is employed and has not lived with his parents for six years, also told his mother for the fourth time that she needs to upgrade his data plan.

8th-Grade Health Class Squirms Throughout Entire Screening Of 'Miracle Of Abortion'
CANTON, MI — According to sources at Thomas E. Dewey Middle School, all 26 students in Mrs. Flannery's fifth-period health class squirmed uncomfortably and grimaced in disgust Thursday throughout the screening of a 45-minute educational video titled The Miracle Of Abortion. Sources reported that the film, which uses actual footage of one woman's abortion experience — from contacting a provider, to entering the facility, to induced dilation and suction-aspiration, to disposal — was shown to the anxious and embarrassed students on a large television set that had been wheeled in from the AV department. "It was so sick," said 13-year-old Ethan Grimm, stating that he felt queasy and could barely eat lunch after watching the video. "When it came out, it was all slimy and such a gross color. Ugh." "We've all heard about how abortions work, but I didn't expect it to be so disgusting in real life," Grimm added. During the video's first 20 minutes, as the patient and various surgical tools were prepped for the procedure, the only noise reportedly made by the students was the sound of anxious fidgeting as they repositioned themselves in their seats. While many grew red in the face and giggled audibly at the first sight of the woman's genitals, the chuckles are said to have quickly turned into gasps and groans of revulsion as the film approached its climactic scene of embryo evacuation. Class members confirmed that ever since the sixth grade, the inevitable prospect of watching The Miracle Of Abortion had filled them with a sense of dread and nervous anticipation, as they had heard disturbing, yet intriguing, tales from older students about the highly graphic nature of the video, including ominous mentions of placentas, speculums, and an electric pump. According to reports, the level of anxiety in Mrs. Flannery's class began rising earlier this week when students began a sex-education unit on unwanted pregnancy. Later, after watching the video, the eighth-graders unanimously agreed that the simple line drawings in the "Abortion" chapter of their health class textbook had not prepared them for the real footage and graphic scenes depicted in the film. "I couldn't even watch when they showed the doctor examining the uterine contents," said Jessica Coleman, 13, noting that the whole process appeared unbearable to her. "I think I still want to have a kid aborted when I get older, but after watching this video, I think I'll only have one." In spite of the class's overwhelming negative response, numerous sources confirmed that one student, 14-year-old Travis Wesson, appeared "totally into" the video, leaning in toward the screen and never once averting his eyes. In both the moments leading up to and immediately following the screening of the film, health teacher Diane Flannery, 53, is said to have reminded the unsettled students that the events depicted on screen were 100 percent real, and simply a natural part of life and sexual behavior. "Every year, there's a lot of uneasiness when I show this video," Flannery said. "I recognize it's uncomfortable for kids their age to watch, but as they start to become aware of their own sexuality, it's important they see what actually happens to the female body during abortion." "They're going to have to learn about it some time," Flannery continued. "And while they may find abortion unpleasant now, I always assure them that when they become sexually active adults and start thinking more about their own lives and children, they'll realize what a true miracle it is."

Waters Tested As 12-Year-Old Says 'Shit' In Front Of Mom For First Time
SAGINAW, MI — In a tentative attempt to test the waters a bit, local 12-year-old Connor Bartlett told reporters that he took a chance on saying the word "shit" in front of his mother for the first time Friday. "I've been dipping my toe in there with 'hell' and 'sucks' for a while and she hasn't really said anything yet, so I figured, hey, might as well jump in feet-first with 'shit' and see what happens," the preteen said of his inaugural usage of the harsh expletive in his mother's presence, adding that "if she freaked out, [he] could always just switch back to 'crap,' no problem." "As far as I can tell, she didn't really seem to react or notice, so it looks like I'm pretty good to go. I wonder what else I can get away with." At press time, sources confirmed that Bartlett had abruptly learned the limits of his mother's tolerance for profanity after diving right in the deep end and calling her a "fucking bitch."

Humane Society Volunteer Spends Whole Adoption Meeting Trying To Sell Family On Sicker Cat
TOPEKA, KS — The moment Laurie and Ronald Bergman indicated their willingness to adopt an abused 2-year-old tabby in need of a caring home, a volunteer at Helping Hands Humane Society began trying to convince the couple to take a much sicker cat instead, sources confirmed Wednesday. "I'm not saying you wouldn't be happy with that younger cat, but ol' Sweet Pea here is so sleepy and cuddly, you can do just about anything you want to with him," adoption coordinator Allison Gilbert said before demonstrating how the cat still appeared to have most of his fur when held at a certain angle. "Look at how sleepy and cuddly he is! And with this little guy you don't need to worry about spending a fortune on cat food, because Sweet Pea doesn't have much of an appetite — do you Sweet Pea?" Gilbert reportedly went on to praise Sweet Pea's coughlike purr and remark on how he must be really happy to see the Bergmans, seeing as he was shaking even more than usual.

Area Lady's Gentleman Caller Under Employ Of Jiffy Lube
HORNELL, NY — The identity of the mysterious gentleman whose amorous attentions have of late been accorded to local lady Kelly Gabbert was at last revealed as Mr. Kyle Bemis, a jocund bachelor of some repute who close acquaintances confirmed is, at present, under the employ of the Jiffy Lube enterprise. "Being as he is an eligible man possessed of a reasonably noble bearing, the eager pursuer oft calls upon the young lady at home after settling the duties of said oil station office," said a confidant of Ms. Gabbert, noting that Mr. Bemis may even take a turn about the local Stop 'N Shop parking lot in hopes, perchance, that he might woo the fair maiden of Steuben County whilst on her cigarette break. "Neighbors have on great occasion observed the fashionable young man ferrying the lady about town in his 600-horsepower Ford Mustang or escorting her to lavish dinner engagements at the most opulent of wing bars, whereupon he customarily sends for a platter of barbecue chicken and spicy-sweet sauce." At press time, sources reported the winsome paramour had beckoned his beloved to the driveway with three honks of the car horn.

At press time, the fleetingly relevant man was being simply lavished with attention from a colleague asking him if he could print out another bracket.

"I really don't want to go over there," said Gannon, adding that he would prefer to avoid asking the lip-pierced, teenage girl with a ski cap covering her dyed-red hair if she would please move her backpack so he could browse the shelves. "I'll just pretend to browse the Business and Money section until they leave." At press time, Gannon had decided to exit the bookstore, saying that he could just order volume two of Alan Moore's Swamp Thing collection on Amazon.

Area Man On Personal Mission To Explain Why Universally Enjoyed Things Are Bad
RICHMOND, VA — Describing it as "his life's calling," local man Gary Lerner, 31, revealed Thursday that he is on a personal quest to enlighten the world about why things everybody enjoys are actually bad. Lerner, whose stated mission is to explain to his fellow human beings why any appreciation of their favorite movies, music, television, and books is entirely misplaced, told reporters that whenever he hears a group of people unanimously praising something, the task of correcting them always falls upon him. "If there is a thing that is universally cherished, then I have an obligation to help people understand why they're wrong for liking it," said Lerner, adding that while it's tempting to let his friends simply enjoy a new song or TV show, he ultimately has a responsibility to point out its every flaw until it is utterly ruined for them. "I can't, for example, stand by in good conscience while everyone talks about how much they love Exile On Main St.. Not when the guitar riffs don't have nearly the inventiveness or clarity of the Rolling Stones' earlier work and, let's be honest, the lyrics are hardly among Jagger's best." "At the end of the day, it isn't right for the greater public to simply take pleasure in whatever they happen to like," Lerner continued. "I can't let that happen. I won't let that happen." According to Lerner, rather than acknowledging that a film like The Dark Knight Rises is entertaining, the way a normal person might, he has a special duty to argue that it is, in fact, completely horrible. Describing the movie as "an overhyped snooze," Lerner noted that director Christopher Nolan is a ponderous and only marginally talented filmmaker, and that no serious person could possibly enjoy the performance of Christian Bale, an actor Lerner described as "not nearly as good as people think he is." Among the many other widely beloved things that Lerner has reportedly made it his mission to invalidate are the original Star Wars trilogy, the Olympics, actor Daniel Day-Lewis, chocolate, the Beatles, Vincent van Gogh, central air-conditioning, and the Internet. "People need to realize — and it is my objective to make them realize — that afternoons spent relaxing at the beach are completely overrated, as is summertime in general," Lerner said. "And fall. All of the holidays, too — at least the major ones." "Same goes for smartphones, the novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald, and most types of beer," Lerner added. "It's like, whatever makes people happy and puts a big ol' dopey grin on their face, they just eat it right up. Well, I simply will not stand for it." Along with his campaign to disparage things everyone loves, Lerner confirmed that he also takes it upon himself to defend things everyone hates by lamenting how scandalously underrated they are. "You know, Godfather III is actually not that bad," Lerner said. "If you look at it in terms of the overarching story, it's actually a really fitting end to the saga, because you finally get to see Michael feel remorse for the things he did in the first two movies. I'm not sure anybody else really got that." So far, sources confirmed, Lerner has had some success in his crusade, making his sister-in-law Jennifer feel stupid for saying she enjoys bike rides in the park and shaming his roommate Michael into agreeing that blue jeans really aren't so great after all. "The other day I mentioned how I'm looking forward to the next three-day weekend, and that really set Gary off," said coworker Nick Powell, 28, adding that his officemates have learned that when Lerner is around they should avoid mentioning anything that brings them happiness. "He went on this long rant about how three days isn't enough time to take a big trip and only makes it tougher to adjust back to a regular schedule when it's over." "He had a point, I guess, but goddamn it," Powell added. "I wanted to punch him right in his smug fucking face." When reached for comment, Lerner told reporters that ending a news story with a follow-up comment from a source was a "lame and hacky" journalistic technique.

Lot Of Bold Talk About Making Broth Going Around Apartment
CHICAGO — Considering the bold words being bandied about haven't amounted to anything yet, there sure is a lot of serious talk about making broth going on right now in a local apartment on West Charleston Street, reports confirmed Wednesday. "I was thinking I might make some broth for tonight," said roommate Ryan Benson, who talked a pretty big game about "throwing in some beef bones" but had yet to actually grow a fucking pair, step up to the stove, and slowly simmer some meaty, thick-marrowed bones in order to draw out their subtle flavors. "You just have to boil water in a stockpot and then put in whatever you want. It's easy." At press time, skeptical sources indicated that a lot of cavalier boasts of maybe heading down to the farmer's market to pick up some fresh carrots and celery had yet to a result in any apartment occupants enjoying a goddamn bowl of hearty stew.

Tragic Accident Kills Aspiring Living Person
BOISE, ID — According to friends and family, the automobile accident that claimed the life of area youth Evan Laskin this week tragically cut short the prospects of a talented 18-year-old who had aspired his whole life to be a living person. Those closest to him said Laskin would be remembered not only as a loving son and caring friend, but also as a gifted young man who, right up until the very end, showed tremendous promise when it came to being alive. "His whole life, Evan wanted nothing more than to exist," said Bryan Dermott, a classmate and close friend of Laskin who shared his ambition to have a functioning central nervous system. "It's a big part of who he was. He was always talking about consuming vital nutrients, metabolizing them, producing new cells to replace old or damaged ones, breathing. Living was the thing that was most important to him, and he was really good at it, too." "He was alive practically all the time," Dermott continued. "In fact, when I last talked to him, I specifically remember him being alive." Many people who knew him well confirmed Laskin lived almost every single day, sometimes for hours at a time, and said continuing his life was something he talked about constantly. Sources recalled how the high school senior would light up when the subject turned to living, but would often drift off or appear to grow distant at the mention of dying, something he never showed much interest in. Growing up in a family of living people — his father Maurice was an auto mechanic who lived whenever he could, while his mother Paula also took great pride in being a self-sustaining assemblage of organic molecules — Laskin reportedly displayed a proclivity and passion for existence from a very young age. "Often I'd wake up at six in the morning and Evan would already be downstairs moving around, thinking about things, experiencing continuous reality, and responding to external stimuli," said Paula Laskin, adding that her son had covered the walls of his bedroom with posters of living people he idolized. "Even as a toddler, he talked about how much he wanted to be alive, to have functioning organs and measurable brain activity. You could tell just by being around him that Evan's calling in life was to be a living human being." Laskin's father told reporters he believed his boy could have grown up to be very successful at existing. "I guess that's how I'll always remember him — as an alive person," Laskin's father said. "I'll never forget when I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, whether it was a living person or a dead person. Well, he cut me off right there and told me he wanted to be alive. I was so very, very proud of him at that moment." "I like to think that Evan was alive right up until the moment he died," he continued through tears. "That's just the kind of person he was." Students and faculty at Laskin's school said they planned to honor the teen's memory with a prolonged moment of life tomorrow morning.

Everyone At Airport Delighted By Chubby Family Rapidly Waddling Toward Gate
NEWARK, NJ — The stress and tedium of air travel were reportedly relieved Wednesday when passengers in Newark Liberty Airport's Terminal C were treated to the wheezing, waddling antics of an overweight family hurriedly straining to catch a flight to Orlando. "Well, that was an utter delight," said witness Monica Adler, adding that it was "wonderfully satisfying" to see a frazzled and obese mother try to hang on to her Auntie Anne's pretzel while running to her gate. "Watching them huffing and puffing, yelling at the children to speed up but then falling behind themselves, all while weighed down by their carry-on baggage… The only thing that could have made it more enjoyable would have been 'Baby Elephant Walk' playing over the loudspeakers." At press time, onlookers were bursting into delighted cheers as the family had to suddenly turn around and run the other way following a gate change announcement.

Dripping Wet 7-Year-Old Gets On Hotel Elevator
ATLANTA — An elevator at the Airport Ramada Inn was boarded Friday afternoon by a dripping wet 7-year-old child, sources within the hotel reported. Eyewitnesses confirmed the drenched youth, who wore a towel draped over his shoulders and swim goggles on his forehead, entered the lobby from an interior courtyard, walked inside the already open elevator, and extended a clammy finger to press the button for the fifth floor. A small puddle reportedly formed as water trickled off the boy, who occasionally shivered during the brief ride, his teeth chattering slightly from the chill. Sources confirmed the sopping wet kid then exited the elevator and headed past the snack machines toward the corridor for rooms 511 to 525, leaving behind him the sharp but fading scent of chlorine.

Man Who Pulls Up With Music Pumping Probably Coming From Someplace Cooler
SAN JOSE, CA — According to sources stopped at the corner of Fourth and St. James Streets, the man driving the custom-painted 2002 Honda Civic with speakers blasting Sean Paul must be coming from someplace much, much cooler. "My God, the racing decals, that chest-thumping bass, those sunglasses inverted so as to rest upon the back of his head. What kind of totally badass place did this guy just leave, and how do I get there myself? " said Dan Singleman, awestruck even to be in the presence of a man reclined so far back in the driver's seat. "Just look at him. The fact that his rear window is tinted makes me wonder if there are additional cool people sitting in the back who do not wish to be seen by those who are less cool. " Judging by the burnout the man just performed, Singleman said he could only assume the driver must also be on his way to someplace very cool.

Longtime Teacher Retires Without Changing A Single Student's Life
MARION, OH — Local residents on Friday struggled to recollect the legacy of educator Jerry Kowalski, 68, who next month will complete his 43-year teaching career without having had a lasting impact on the life of even one of his students. "Oh, yeah, that guy. English class, right? I kind of remember him," software manager and 1998 Harding High School graduate Andrew Dillard said of his former history teacher, who failed to impart a single life lesson or piece of unforgettable encouragement to any of the 7,178 students who passed through his classroom over the years. "I don't recall him offering advice or motivating me to make something of myself or anything like that, but I guess he was all right. I think he gave me a B, which was cool. " In contrast, fellow faculty members said they would always remember their departing colleague as someone who sat in the corner of the teacher's lounge smoking and never said much.

"All day long, I look forward to kicking back and hearing a series of lame cheap shots at Lindsay Lohan's expense before I head to bed," said Bellows, who claimed that with the stresses of his job he needed time at the end of every day to just unwind and listen to a hack comedian rip into the emotionally damaged young woman. "I don't think that's too much to ask.

'The Recovery Is Here,' Reports Underemployed Man Making $20,000 Less Than He Used To
CARBONDALE, IL — Citing the fact that he's now able to make the minimum payment on his credit cards each month and is back in the workforce making $20,000 less than when he was laid off in 2009, 43-year-old Tom Baker declared Tuesday that the economy was recovering by leaps and bounds. "The tide is turning! " said the man who had to sell his four-bedroom home for less than what he owed on it and move his wife and three children to a cramped apartment 800 miles away. "My company just hired 50 skilled contract employees with a guaranteed eight months of paid employment. America is back! " Baker said that if the economic turnaround continues, he may be able to save enough money to send at least one of his children in for a dental checkup.

4-Year-Old Shows New Doll The Ropes
BIRMINGHAM, AL — According to sources, local 4-year-old Annie Platt spent much of Tuesday afternoon showing the ropes to her newest toy, a stuffed rag doll named Lucy. "You have to come to tea time when I say so, and stay away from Jerry the monkey, because he bites," Platt said after familiarizing Lucy with the box of crayons, the beanbag chair, and the play stove, which the new doll is under no circumstances ever allowed to touch. "And remember, I'm in charge here, so I make the rules. " Later in the day, Platt reportedly forced Lucy to sit in the corner, allegedly for breaking nap time rules, but many in the playroom felt the toddler was simultaneously trying to establish her dominance over the newcomer while sending a warning to the other toys.

Charlize Theron Hired To Ride Struggling Cleveland Light Rail System Monday Through Friday
CLEVELAND — As part of an ongoing effort to rejuvenate its public transportation system, the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority announced Wednesday that it had signed a three-year, $32 million deal hiring Academy Award–winning actress Charlize Theron to ride the city's light-rail lines eight hours a day, Monday through Friday. "Each work week, Ms. Theron will bring the glitz and glamour of a Hollywood movie premiere right to Cleveland's own RTA Rapid Transit trains," spokesperson Ted Reardon said of the agreement, which will also require the 36-year-old Hancock star to use Cleveland's public buses for 14 consecutive hours on the third Saturday of every month. "Who knows? You might just see Charlize on the Red Line, the Blue Line, or sleeping on a wooden bench in the Tower City station! " This latest initiative reportedly builds on the Cleveland water service's recent awareness program, which largely involved paying Alfred Molina to swim laps in the central reservoir.

Microbrewer Trying To Work Dog Into Name Of New Seasonal Beer
SENECA, OR — Owner and founder of Fossil Bed Brewery Dave Walker, 39, reportedly struggled Saturday to find a way to work his 5-year-old Labrador retriever mix into the name of a new spiced winter ale. "I was going to just call it Puppy Weizen, but that's kind of impersonal, and technically it's not a wheat beer," said Walker, who has so far failed to find a name that captures both his pet's personality and the distinct raisin and pepper flavoring of the microbrew. "I have to do something to make it stand out on the shelf alongside Flying Dog, Sea Dog, Turbodog, Smuttynose Old Brown Dog, and Dogfish Head." At press time, Walker had yet to figure out how make his dog, Barley, a part of the beer's name.

Man Pretty Sure He Slept
AKRON, OH — Following eight restless hours in bed, copy repair technician Jason Murphy reported that he was "80 percent" sure he had slept the previous night. "It definitely seemed like I was sleeping for a while there, though I don't really feel rested, so it's hard to say," a haggard Murphy told coworkers Friday. "I mean, when my alarm went off, I jumped, so that must have meant I was asleep, right? Then again, I remember looking up at the clock a couple times and it was 3:38, so I'm not quite sure what happened there. " Murphy went on to tell reporters that, regardless, he will try to sleep again this evening.

Adult Bookstore To Enhance Shopping Experience With Café
DENVER — Seeking to create a shopping environment more inviting to potential customers, Blue News Adult Books and Novelties announced Monday that it had opened an in-store café. "Now people can enjoy a latte and a black currant scone while they're thumbing through the latest issue of Furry Femmes or Cunts Who Put Out," bookstore owner Ronald Powers said as he sprayed bleach on the seat of a booth. "They come in for the coffee and the free Wi-Fi, but then browse around and wind up buying a bottle of Slip-N-Glide and a King Dong. We're offering a personalized experience you just can't get from online retailers." Powers added that the café would serve only the finest Guatemalan fair-trade coffees and the filthiest, most exploitative all-anal action available in print.

Bus Passenger Believes She Lives In World Where Curried Shrimp Is Odorless
PHILADELPHIA — According to several witnesses, bus passenger Marie Wallace apparently believes she exists in a universe wherein curried shrimp does not give off any odor. Wallace, who demonstrated her conviction Saturday by eating large amounts of the food from a Styrofoam container while traveling on a crowded Greyhound coach from Philadelphia to Boston, is reportedly under the impression that aromatic molecular compounds do not travel through space and react with olfactory chemoreceptor cells in the human nose. Passengers also suggested that Wallace believes sound waves do not carry within a narrow, enclosed vehicle, judging from the animated seven-minute phone conversation she had with her friend Deb about her friend Deb's ex-husband, Jim.

Smooth Transaction At DMV Exaggerated Into Story Anyway
ALBANY, NY — Though he spent no more than 20 minutes at the Department of Motor Vehicles Tuesday getting his driver's license renewed, Dan Nesbitt, 27, decided to embellish his experience anyway, saying he was mistakenly given the wrong form to fill out, the guy in front of him took "forever," and the person behind the counter wasn't exactly helpful, either. "That place is unbelievable," said Nesbitt, who didn't have to wait more than five minutes for his number to be called and successfully left the DMV with the one thing he came in for. "And God help you if you don't walk in there with nine different forms of identification. " As of press time, Nesbitt could not be reached for comment due to the "fucking typical" lack of tellers available at the bank.

Everyone Giving Up On John After Latest Movie Recommendation
CARLIN, NV — Expressing their exasperation upon watching the latest in his long string of disappointing movie recommendations, friends of area resident John Blakely announced Monday they had decided to give up on him completely. "That's it — he's done," said 27-year-old Patrick Cairnes, who added that he blamed himself for not giving up on Blakely sooner, especially considering what their friendship went through when Blakely insisted he listen to Kings of Leon. "John went on and on about how I should see The Adjustment Bureau, but then I watched it and it's fucking terrible. At this point, I'm actually starting to wonder how we became friends in the first place. " When asked if Blakely had even once recommended a movie they liked, several friends conceded The Social Network was "pretty good," but said they hardly needed anyone's endorsement to go see that one.

Fertility Center Asks Couple If They Want Some Cheap Eggs From A Real Fucked Up Chick
CINCINNATI — Saying they could save a few bucks, a fertility counselor asked Anita and Joe Jansen Monday if they wished to consider far more affordable donor eggs from a totally fucked-up chick. "Seriously, you can get these things for 40, 50 percent less if you're okay with a donor who's absolutely batshit insane," said Dr. Susan Rowling, pointing her index finger at the side of her head and twirling it in a circle. "I'm not sure how someone this plainly bonkers slipped through our screening process, but our mistake can save you a bundle. " Rowling added that the donor was totally schizo and definitely a cutter but that there was no guarantee those traits would be passed onto the child.

Wife Unfazed By Husband's Sad E-Mails To Other Women
SPOKANE, WA — After stumbling upon several pathetic, mostly one-way e-mail correspondences between her husband and other women, local real estate agent Gertrude Tisch said Monday she did not feel particularly threatened by the discovery, and actually held a certain amount of pity for her 22-year partner in marriage. "I'd say about 90 percent of the e-mails I found are just Greg trying to confirm receipt of his last message, because he hasn't heard back from the woman yet," said Tisch, adding that she has half-entertained the idea of creating a fake account and writing him back herself, just to boost his spirits a little. "Then there's the e-mail to his high school crush where she wrote back saying she didn't remember who he was. I found a few attempted starts of a reply in his drafts folder, but the poor guy must have lost heart after a couple paragraphs." While Tisch admitted she should probably feel more upset about her husband reaching out to other women, she said such concerns have been more than outweighed by the amazing sex she's been having with her boss for the past six months.

Shaken Secretary Of Transportation Reduces Speed Limit To 5 MPH After Witnessing Accident
WASHINGTON — Still reeling from having witnessed a brutal five-car pileup Thursday on I-495, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has authorized the reduction of the federal speed limit to five miles per hour, effective immediately. "There was just twisted metal everywhere, and this one guy had blood all over the side of his face and the paramedics kept telling him to stay awake — it was so bad, you don't even know," said a trembling LaHood, adding that if Americans had seen what he just saw, they would think twice about ever getting behind the wheel again. "People forget that cars are these big, heavy, fast-moving things that can just utterly destroy you. Make the slightest mistake at 65 mph and you could end up dead in an instant. Literally an instant. " LaHood later stated Americans should drive only when absolutely necessary because they definitely don't want to end up like that one guy.

Amish Teen Spends Entire Rumspringa At Apple Store
PITTSBURGH — Since discovering the electronics retailer by chance at the beginning of his ritual period of experimentation outside the strict regimen of the Amish life, 16-year-old Isaac Stoltzfus has spent every day of his rumspringa at a local Apple Store, sources reported Monday. "This place is amazing! Everyone here is super-friendly, and they let me try out all these neat computers and phones and stuff without pressuring me to buy anything," said Stotzfus, who reportedly can be seen at the store's entrance at sunrise each morning, waiting for the doors to open. "I love the interactive displays and presentations, of course, but probably my favorite thing to do here is just stand back and take in the atmosphere of the whole place. I had no idea the modern world was so shiny." Stolzfus added that he typically spends his entire day in the Apple Store, leaving only briefly to "head around the corner for a Jamba Juice."

NEW YORK — Local shell of a man Joel Marsden said Wednesday that, absolutely, he'd be happy to take care of your cat while you're out of town for three weeks and his entire world is falling to pieces all around him. "Sure, I can help you out in the midst of my total emotional breakdown, no problem," said the 41-year-old man, who may soon have to abandon the past decade of his life and move halfway across the country because his job is being relocated. "I'm in complete psychological shambles at the moment, and of course, you bet, anything I can do to help. It's not like I have anything else going on right now. When's a good time to pick up your keys? " Marsden also said that, once you return, he'd be happy to come by and help you move a bookshelf while he sobs uncontrollably.

Fish At Pretty Good Place In Its Life Right Now
GULF OF MEXICO — Pausing a moment from swimming around its shallow coastal habitat to speak with reporters, a 14-month-old Atlantic tarpon admitted Tuesday that it was currently at a "pretty good place in [its] life" and "couldn't be happier. " "I feel good. I've got my health, I've reached full maturity, the autumnal migration went great — I really can't complain," said the 5-foot Megalops atlanticus, stating that it had everything a pelagic fish could ask for, from abundant sources of crab and grass-shrimp to zero predators in its visual field. "And this ambient water temperature and elevated salinity level feel great on my fins. Things just seem to be going my way right now, I guess. " The herring went on to say that it didn't want to jinx itself, but it had to admit its spawning prospects were looking "real good" too.

Man's Utter Failure In Life A Bit Of A Sore Spot
MADISONVILLE, TN — Sources close to local man Mike Ferguson confirmed Saturday that over time they have learned not to bring up their friend's utter failure to achieve anything whatsoever in life, a sensitive topic they said has always been a bit of a sore spot for him. Longtime acquaintances of Ferguson reported that the otherwise amiable 39-year-old gets "a bit touchy" whenever someone makes even the most passing mention of his complete lack of personal and professional accomplishment. "Ordinarily, he's a pretty okay guy to have around," said Greg Ostrowski, who has known Ferguson since high school. "But you have to be very, very careful if you bring up how he's always come up short at anything he's ever attempted. If you're not extremely delicate in the way you broach how success of any sort has constantly eluded him, he'll get very defensive. "Honestly, it's often best to avoid that subject altogether," Ostrowski added. "But that's really hard. Mike's fucked up an awful lot. At pretty much everything, really. Ferguson's particular sensitivity to his lifelong ineptness was reportedly not apparent at first, and friends said they were often caught off guard by the amount of offense he took at the slightest reference to the fact he was totally squandering his time on earth. "I just remember casually saying something about how he was nearly broke, had never had a relationship that lasted longer than two months, and was still working part-time at his dad's sporting goods store, and he suddenly just bristled," said former roommate Ted McCormick, adding that he initially thought his friend's response was a sarcastic overreaction. "I said, 'Sorry, I didn't realize that was such a big deal to you.' I mean, how the hell was I supposed to know that just alluding to the fact he couldn't hack more than a semester and a half of college was going to get under his skin so much? McCormick also told reporters Ferguson could benefit from having more of a sense of humor about the four decades of futility that have made his life unbearable. "Everyone's got that one thing they're a little weird about, including me," said McCormick, admitting that at five-foot-six, he was sometimes sensitive about his height. "But I don't get all testy about it when people make a joke or two. I think if Mike just learned to laugh and not get bent out of shape every time someone makes an offhand remark about how he's essentially blown any chance he'll ever have for happiness, it'd be a lot easier to talk to him. Added McCormick, "It's already tough enough being friends with a loser like that, you know?

Early Stage Threesome Forming In Corner Of Party
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA — According to reports from Adam Hartford's house party on Preston Avenue, a male and two females have separated from the core group of attendees and are currently in the nascent stage of forming a threesome in the far corner of the living room. Factoring in the subjects' increased levels of giggling and flirtation, suggestive body language, and projected alcohol consumption, sources have determined the ménage à trois will reach full maturation three hours from now, likely in Hartford's partially finished basement. Experts also stated that the females' recent progression from talking about kissing each other to actually doing so, even if only jokingly, marks a crucial threshold in the early-phase three-way, indicating the eventual occurrence of group sex is now a statistical certainty. While those observing the threesome's gradual materialization admitted it was fascinating to watch such a natural phenomenon coalesce, they acknowledged the rare marvel was "completely gross" because it involved Jeff.

Roommate, Girlfriend Never Seem To Have Sex
BROOKLINE, MA — By all outward indications, Derek Nesbitt and his girlfriend of eight months, Shawna Morrero, never have sex, baffled roommate Max Wirsing reported Tuesday. "It's pretty odd, frankly, that he and Shawna rarely hang out in his bedroom, and when they do, they never turn the music up loud," said Wirsing, pointing out that both he and his roommate have similar 9-to-5 work schedules, effectively ruling out the possibility that the couple has sex during the day. "What's more, my room is right next to his, and I haven't once heard them go at it while I'm trying to sleep. Bizarre." Wirsing later determined that Morrero and Nesbit could only be having sex during an 8-to-10-minute window on Monday and Thursday evenings, when Wirsing leaves the apartment to move his car to the opposite side of the street.

Tornado Victims Thank News Organization For Its In-Depth Reporting On Storm's Carnage
'It Was Personal Yet Not At All Exploitive,' Victims Agree WINDSOR, NC — Still struggling to cope in the aftermath of an F3 tornado that ripped through town last week, citizens expressed gratitude to this newspaper for its meritorious in-depth coverage of the tragedy, lauding the publication's ability to deliver aggressive reporting while remaining sensitive to the victims' humanity. Though the tornado claimed 46 lives and caused more than $40 million in property damage, many in this devastated community told reporters Monday they could take solace in the fact that such a responsible news organization was on site to contribute hard-hitting yet pointed commentary that skillfully captured every nuance of the storm's ruinous toll. "Beginning with the speed and accuracy of their initial coverage, you could tell this newspaper cared only about reporting the story fairly and thoroughly, and was not interested in exploiting our suffering for cheap spectacle or personal gain," said former bank teller Amber Devoe, who later grew emotional talking about The Onion's touching three-part feature on her family's plight. "They truly illuminated a significant and complex event with lucid writing and a sensitive presentation. "I've lost everything — my home, my job, everything," Devoe added. "But this newspaper's unwavering commitment to first-rate journalism has given me the courage to continue on. Though townspeople remained in a state of shock, they spent most of Monday applauding the news organization's "poignant," "classy," and "often brilliant" coverage of the storm. Explaining that they never felt taken advantage of, citizens said they hoped the newspaper would return repeatedly for follow-up stories, adding that they already missed watching reporters do their fantastic work. In addition, every single person interviewed agreed that reading the newspaper's coverage of the event was the one thing that gave them comfort. "With my world crumbling around me, the paper's consistent display of journalistic excellence and its evenhanded touch of humanity was something to look forward to," said Roy Brusckewicz, 56, standing by the splintered remains of his old trailer, which he said was "artfully profiled" in the newspaper's Onion Magazine. "I appreciated the special emphasis they placed on investigating all aspects of the story, from the tornado's human toll to its effect on the local economy and culture. Really great stuff. The news organization, with 3.6 million print readers in 11 cities nationwide and a website that attracts more than 7.5 million unique visitors every month, is not just confined to traditional media: Its expansive social networking presence and recent launch of mobile apps are a testament to the newspaper's embrace of new technologies and its willingness to innovate in tandem with the changing face of journalism, sources reported. To date, the newspaper has received a number of awards for its excellence, with one notable exception. "Typically, after the reporting of such a tragedy, praise is heaped onto less deserving publications, such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Tribune," said livestock farmer Colin Atkins, whose livelihood was decimated by the twister. "This town will feel the effects of this tragedy for decades, but the real injustice would be if those piss-poor excuses for newspapers I just mentioned didn't lose readers and precious ad dollars due to their incompetent coverage. Atkins, who lost both his sons in the tornado, continued to rail against such media organizations, suggesting that while other reporters might get more attention with their flashy journalism degrees and their bylines, the writers of this newspaper are the only ones who truly empathized with the community's plight. "All we did was get hit by a tornado — they're the real heroes," he said. "In recognition of their public service, they deserve some sort of prestigious national prize in journalism. Added Atkins, "You know, if such a thing exists.

Everything In Power Done To Appear Interesting To Attractive Woman On Subway
NEW YORK — According to evening commuters, 26-year-old web designer Kevin Hanley summoned every resource at his disposal Tuesday in an effort to appear more thoughtful and sophisticated, hoping to capture the attention of an attractive woman on the subway. "As soon as she got on the train, he sat up straighter, adjusted the angle he was holding his book at so he could show off the title, and started doing this thing where he would casually run his fingers across his stubble," said a witness to the scene, adding that Hanley would also look off into the middle distance from time to time and smile as though he were contemplating something humorous or poignant. "And at one point, I swear to God, he even furrowed his brow and wrote something down in a little notebook. " When he gave up his seat to an elderly person in an effort to look chivalrous, the attractive woman appeared to notice Hanley at last, walking up to him, saying "Excuse me," and maneuvering past him so she could exit at her stop.

"There's no reason for this. All they're doing is having a nice meal and — oh, you fucking assholes, stop laughing before I stab you in the face. See, there I go again.

"I believe this one will have a lot of traction," Lanier said of the routine he believes will provide an easy way to break the ice in social situations or insert a little levity into serious discussions. "It may require slight modifications from year to year, and I'll probably have to tweak a few things depending on the audience, but I intend to ride this thing out as long as I can.

Old Photographs Reveal Grandmother Never That Attractive
POCATELLO, ID — Family members gathered around a photo collage of matriarch Maria Esquivel, 85, were surprised to learn Tuesday that she was never really very beautiful. The faded black-and-white photos revealed that, in childhood, her plain brown eyes did not have a mischievous twinkle, and in adulthood, her stout body and broad features placed her roughly in the 45th percentile of feminine attractiveness. "Wow, she was so plain when she was younger," confirmed Esquivel's granddaughter Carrie, as she stared at the photograph, wide-eyed. "Guess grandma was never much to look at, huh? " Upon completing the trip down memory lane, family members ran their fingers across the precious photographs once more, quietly thanked God they got their grandfather's looks, and put the photos back on Esquivel's casket.

Last Of 2008 Christmas Puppies Euthanized, Marking Start Of Spring
NEW YORK — In a familiar sign that spring is just around the corner, animal shelters across the nation announced this week that they have put down the last batch of dogs that were given as Christmas gifts in 2008. "It's that time of year again," said Darien, CT animal control specialist Erica Tierney, throwing the carcass of yet another 2-year-old Labradoodle into an incinerator. "As soon as the weather starts to warm up, we find ourselves administering pentobarbital injections to those final few puppies who were once a welcome Christmas gift, but have since been abandoned by people tired of caring for them. "Come April, we'll have a nice little break, but before you know it, the 2009 puppies will start rolling in and then the whole cycle starts up again," added Tierney, removing a soiled red bow from the neck of a dead cocker spaniel. Tierney joked with reporters that she could "almost set [her] watch" by the annual arrival at the shelter of emaciated, flea-ridden dogs seized by the county, all of them gifts from two years ago who gradually became less adorable until they were no longer able to elicit the sympathy of their owners. For many Americans, this cycle is simply part of the rhythm of life: The earth lies dormant in winter, a time when children and romantic partners receive puppies as shortsighted holiday gifts, and then in spring the world reawakens as sunny days return, green leaves sprout forth, the mass dog euthanasia hits its peak, and flowers bloom. "Two years ago we bought Lisa a puppy for Christmas," said Jason Hutton of San Diego, who quietly abandoned his daughter's Lhasa apso by the side of a road when he grew weary of family arguments over whose turn it was to feed it. "And there came a point where it just wasn't a puppy anymore, you know? According to animal control officials, the dogs they are most commonly obliged by mercy to kill are pugs, miniature pinschers, and pit bulls, but the breeds vary as fads and fashions change from year to year. "There must have been a movie with chihuahuas in it a couple years back because half of these little guys are chihuahuas," said Chicago- area veterinary anesthesiologist Leonard Noonan, strapping a gas mask to the muzzle of his 11th small, round- headed dog of the day. "But anything's better than the huge piles of Great Danes we had to deal with after those Scooby-Doo films came out. While Noonan is busy putting down "whatever isn't cute anymore," the seeds for seasons yet to come have already been planted, with American parents gearing up to hit the puppy mills later this year. "We could adopt a dog right now for free from the shelter, but I'm saving up to get my son a purebred dachshund from a breeder," Sandusky, OH–area contractor Richard Wilde said of an animal that will eventually be chained to a cinder block in his backyard and left behind when his family moves. "I should have just enough by Christmastime. Well, probably not for heartworm medication and neutering, but Tyler is just going to go nuts when he sees that little puppy. While animal shelter employees said they were relieved that dog-euthanasia season is over, many reported they were already preparing for the massive influx of Easter rabbits that will signal the transition from spring to summer.

Boise Homemaker Bows Toward Mecca Just To See What It's Like
BOISE, ID — After reading an article about Muslim rituals, curious homemaker Frances Parker decided to give bowing toward Mecca a shot Tuesday.

"It was kind of neat.

15-Year-Old Girl Viciously Torn Apart By Rabid Pack Of Peers
MONTEREY, CA — A stunned crowd outside Del Monte Shopping Center watched in horror Saturday as helpless 15-year-old Haley Garner was savagely attacked and ripped to shreds by a pack of her frenzied peers. "They homed in on her immediately, surrounded the poor girl from all sides, and then just tore her to pieces," witness Barry Motts told reporters, saying there was nothing anyone could do for the defenseless teen except look away and let nature run its course. "As traumatizing as it was, I can see why it happened. A beanpole adolescent standing outside a nice mall in an oversized T-shirt tucked into jean shorts, waiting for her mom to pick her up? It's amazing she survived as long as she did. " Later, the rabid pack of teens reportedly emitted a series of violent screeches before encircling a slightly obese girl who had entered the mall.

KANSAS CITY — According to local Patrick Johnson, the amount of crunchy onion bits baked into Arby's sandwich buns seems to have increased somewhat recently, the 32-year-old mechanic noted while visibly descending into a heavily depressed state. "Yeah, I think there's more onion things, but maybe they're a little smaller, I can't really tell," said the emotionally deteriorating Johnson, moments before slowly dunking a fry into a small paper cup full of ketchup. "I think that paper they wrap the sandwiches in got thinner, too." As of press time, Johnson had left the Arby's to walk home, noticing that the billboard for that Christmas movie was still up.

Seeing Eye Dog Really Blows Off Some Steam In Dog Park
FORT COLLINS, CO — From the moment he was let loose in a local dog park Saturday, golden retriever and licensed Seeing Eye dog Biscuit reportedly blew off some steam by jumping up to lick people's faces, urinating on smaller dogs, and chasing almost everything that moved across his field of vision. "At first he was calm as could be, just leading his owner to a bench and letting her take a seat, but as soon as that guide-harness came off, holy fuck, that dog just went goddamn ballistic," said onlooker Ray Seward, 54, adding that Biscuit was "absolutely going to town" on every dog in the park. "That thing took off like a fucking rocket and sprinted the entire perimeter of the park six times before beelining directly toward this toddler and completely flattening her without even missing a step. Inevitably, the place cleared out, and then he just sat down and barked, nonstop, until he'd tired himself out. " Sources confirmed Biscuit was last seen calmly walking back to his owner, where he lay down at her feet and waited until she was ready to be led back home.

Whiny, Selfish 8-Year-Old Always Wants His Parents To Stop Yelling At Each Other
ST. PAUL, MN — In a shockingly selfish pattern of behavior that has occurred repeatedly over the past six months, local 8-year-old and whiny brat Sean Cooper has continued his habit of interrupting his parents with his pleas for them to stop screaming at each other, sources reported Thursday. Sean, who has an extensive history of not minding his own business, apparently cannot display the common courtesy of keeping his mouth shut as his parents, Robert and Karen Cooper, loudly discuss Robert's short temper and Karen's controlling nature at the family dinner table, or in the middle of the living room late at night when Sean is supposed to be in bed sleeping. "I wish Mommy and Daddy would be nice to each other," the wantonly disrespectful second-grader told reporters, seemingly unaware of the total lack of gratitude he exhibits toward his parents on a nearly daily basis by constantly interjecting tearful pleas for them to stop arguing. "They used to be happy and now they fight all the time. I just want things to be how they used to be. "I wish I could make them not fight anymore," he continued, perhaps too self-absorbed to realize that whatever his parents happen to be discussing from moment to moment is absolutely none of his concern, and that children should never, under any circumstances, try to involve themselves in the business of adults. "I hope they don't get a divorce. According to sources, despite the fact that no one cares what his opinion is because he's only 8 years old, Sean once again subjected his parents to his rampaging ego late Wednesday night when he knocked on their bedroom door at 1 a.m. and tearfully informed them that he could hear them yelling mean things at each other through his wall. While clutching his stuffed animal and staring morosely at his feet like some sort of sulking, grade-school prima donna, Sean then reportedly proceeded to take up another 45 seconds of his parents' valuable time explaining in needlessly long-winded detail that it made him sad when they fought, never once stopping to take note of how utterly self-indulgent he was sounding, or how his outburst might be construed as utterly inappropriate given the fact that his parents had been in the midst of a private conversation concerning their marriage. "They told me it was very late and they were having a grown-up talk and I should go back to my room," said the child, who was quite rightly put in his place in that instance, and really should have known better than to interrupt in the first place. "Then later I heard Daddy slam their door and go downstairs to his car. After trying to present his parents with a rather condescending and manipulative colored-pencil drawing he had made of the three of them standing outside their house with big smiles on their crudely rendered faces, Sean told reporters in a trembling voice that can only be described as immensely irritating that he didn't "know who to talk to" about the situation with his parents, as though blabbing his mouth off about the lives of others were ever a wise idea. "Why is this happening? " whined the little shit for what felt like the 5,000th time this week, his pouty voice reaching levels of annoyance that would make even the most levelheaded adult want to pick up a chair and throw it across the room in sheer exasperation. "Is it my fault? "I should just run away," added Sean, positing his first sensible thought in years. "Maybe that would make everything better. At press time, Sean was most likely feeling sorry for himself and finding a way to make everything all about him, just as he always does.

Report: Samantha's New Haircut Pretty Bad, But Don't Say Anything
COOKEVILLE, TN — According to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services, the haircut Cookeville resident Samantha Howard got Tuesday looks pretty terrible, but please don't say anything, because she's already a little insecure about it. "It's kind of choppy and lopsided, like one of those hairstyles they say is going to make you look young and cool, but Samantha just can't pull it off," HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said. "Her face is too round, for one thing. Please be advised to tell her it's fine and then change the subject. " As of press time, Howard's haircut just needed to grow in a little, and Americans were being urged to support her decision to maybe wear it in a ponytail for now.

Point Of Story Apparently That Man Ate At Restaurant
ELYSBURG, PA — Friends of 33-year-old Dan Leski were subjected Tuesday to a detailed account of his recent visit to a restaurant, the sole point of which was apparently to communicate the fact that Leski had eaten food and then paid for it. "I thought he was going somewhere with it when he mentioned how the waitress had a foreign accent, but nope, that was just a prelude to the part where he ordered his meal," friend Eric Farber said of the story that began with Leski feeling hungry and ended when the bill — $13.95 plus tax and tip — had been settled. "Evidently Dan had lunch at a restaurant the other day. That's about all we learned. " Farber told reporters he would probably check the restaurant out himself sometime in the near future.

Guests Emerge Shell-Shocked From Rich People's Wedding
MARTHA'S VINEYARD, MA — Citing its 80-piece orchestra and real silver place settings, several of the 500 guests at Saturday's wedding of Boston socialite Elizabeth Kessler and investment banker Peter Graham emerged from the affair dazed and disoriented, sources told reporters. "I've never seen anything like this," said Beth Risser, tightly clasping to her chest the commemorative wedding iPod preloaded with the bride and groom's favorite songs while she waited for the valet to deliver her 1996 Mazda. "There were swans everywhere, 12 videographers, and about $800 worth of candles at my table alone. And was that Henry Kissinger next to the raw oyster bar? " While many of the attendees were bewildered by the spectacle they had witnessed, at least 6 percent of the guests left the wedding worried that the Kesslers had fallen on hard times.

Jim Morrison Foundation Awards $50,000 Grant To Little Shit Who Thinks He's A Poet
LOS ANGELES — Citing the 17-year-old's awkward overuse of Native American imagery and general ability to make long lists of random adjectival phrases, the Jim Morrison Foundation announced Monday the awarding of a $50,000 grant to self-obsessed little shit Jerome Caudry of Shullsburg, WI. "In Jerome's verse, all of which seems to be about Jerome himself as he struggles with the burden of approaching the edge of prophecy and daring to peek over, we hear echoes of the Lizard King himself," read a press release from the foundation, which has given annual grants to brooding, solipsistic pukes since 1983. "This gift should help Mr. Caudry achieve his personal goals, which we hope include winding up dead in a bathtub within the year. " Caudry's myopically self- aggrandizing autobiographical novel The Bleeding Sky's Wife Shatters The Soul-Mask Of The Hopi Postman was also short-listed for this year's Richard Brautigan Prize for Thpppppt! Oh, Give Me a Fucking Break.

Detective Trying To Get Into Mind Of Litterer
LAKEWOOD, NJ — Tired of being led in circles by a shrewd and elusive local litterer, detective Alex Lavin attempted to penetrate the thought process of his arch-nemesis on Wednesday "to find out what makes him tick," sources reported. "He knows I'm hot on his trail, yet he loves the excitement of the chase," Lavin pondered aloud as he surveyed aluminum cans strewn along the median of Route 9. "A plastic bottle, a pack of Camels, a Pringles canister — is he just toying with me?" Later, arriving home to find a still-warm Charleston Chew wrapper on his doorstep, Lavin reportedly peered up and down the block for the shadowy figure he knew wouldn't be there, chuckled softly to himself, and muttered, "Ooh, this guy's good."

"The poor guy must be tuckered out," said roommate Andy Northcutt, explaining that the normally well-behaved Burnsworth had skipped his afternoon nap and then gotten "a little wound up" when his friends came over. "He's already had his dinner, so I know it's not that. I think he's probably just ready to be put down for the night.

Teen Rebel Refusing To Purchase Yearbook
WESTERVILLE, OH — Refusing to march in lockstep with the other drones at Westerville Junior High, 16-year-old rebel Chris Iconia announced Monday he would not be purchasing a copy of the school's 2011 yearbook. "Forget that — let all those other sheep sign each other's little books," said the modern-day James Dean, who bucked the system by wearing a T-shirt for class photos and using an ellipsis as his per≠sonal quote. "Like I'm really going to look back one day and wonder who ran JV track this year? Please, I've got better things to spend $65 on.

Miracle Baby Born With Job
TALLAHASSEE, FL — Following a long and difficult delivery, weary but jubilant doctors announced that at 8:23 a.m. Tuesday, area mother Cathleen Jericho had miraculously given birth to a healthy, strong, and fully employed baby boy. "We've never seen anything like this, but once we saw the resumé come out it was clear that the newborn was the VP of Sales, East Coast Division," said attending physician Dr. Bernard Hunt, who recommended the baby stay in an incubator for several nights until he was fully vested in his company's 401(k) plan. "There was some concern that he was going to have to be put on emergency unemployment for the first week, but this kid had a lot of fight in him and some great references. He'll be able to retire before the age of 6, I'm sure. " While the new parents said they're just thankful their child has 10 finger and 10 toes, they later admitted they'd had their heart set on a lawyer.

"It was on my to-do list, but I kept putting it off and putting it off," the Supreme Being said. "I got so tied up with the floods in Brazil that I nearly blanked on giving Dave a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Hold on a sec . . . there. Fixed." With that, order was restored and Dave Elfman instantly dropped dead in the middle of a knot-tying demonstration in front of his 10-year-old son's Boy Scout troop.

Beating The Post-Holiday Blahs
Many people report feelings of depression after the holidays. Here are some ways you can relieve the seasonal doldrums: ■ Coptic and Greek Orthodox Christians celebrate most holidays days or weeks later. Try temporarily converting to extend your holiday mood. ■ Get a full-spectrum light and keep it in your closet. The fact that you know it's there and can be taken out at any time should be enough to cheer you up. ■ You may have thrown out your tree, but you can still pile your ornaments on the couch and celebrate all over again with a Christmas Cushion! ■ Do not read The Road. ■ Many department stores have old men who will let you sit on their laps year-round. Best of all, it's free! ■ Give yourself one more present by ordering a pizza, shaking it next to your ear, and then opening it while sitting cross-legged on the floor. ■ Why are you trying not to be depressed? Frankly, you're more enjoyable to be around when you're sad. ■ Don't forget that no matter how fat you are now, at least one person in the world is fatter. Gross. ■ Consider the number of shitty presents you received. Remind yourself you don't give shitty presents. Now, pat yourself on your superior back! ■ Every office has that one person whom nothing seems to get to. Punch that person in the face. ■ Compared to your everyday blahs, the post-holiday blahs may not be that bad. ■ Induce coma and get woken up on Mar. 20.

Man Can Get By In His Own Language
TEMPE, AZ — American citizen Ray Ayers can get along pretty well in his native language of English when he has to, the 57-year-old said Friday night after friends commented on his ability to order a meal at a restaurant. "I'm not exactly fluent, but I know enough to get by," said Ayers, adding that he's learned to read facial expressions whenever he's in English-speaking regions, such as the part of Arizona where he lives. "And you can use hand gestures to get drinks, ask about the bathroom, say hello, goodbye, thank you, how much for this. People usually figure out what you mean. " Ayers admitted that he rarely uses anything but the present tense and, except for road signs and some menu items, does not recognize a word of the written language.

Recently Single Al Gore Finally Able To Listen To W.A.S.P. Albums
NASHVILLE, TN — Finally unhindered by his wife Tipper's 25-year-long household ban on violent and sexually explicit music, former vice president Al Gore, 62, reportedly embraced his newfound independence this week by listening to the albums of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P. "For the first time in decades, I get to play the kind of music I like without someone nagging me about what a bad influence it is," said Gore, sitting on the floor of his living room as he cued up the song "Animal (Fuck Like A Beast)" on his stereo. "And I get to crank it up as loud as I want." "These guys are kicking some serious ass," added the two-term U.S. Senator. "Check out this guitar break coming up — it's nasty." Gore, who was prohibited from hearing music with graphic sex, violence, or drug references since Tipper founded the Parents Music Resource Center in 1985, confirmed yesterday that her crusade was "total bullcrap." In addition, Gore said that listening to the forbidden W.A.S.P. albums over and over again had not turned him into a satanic dope fiend as his wife and her associates had warned. "It sucked because we always had to listen to garbage like Carly Simon and Lyle Lovett all the time," said Gore, who told reporters that he was "loving" being single again. "That stuff is lame, man. If it doesn't have big balls and bigger riffs, get it out of my stereo!" According to Gore, being deprived of artists like W.A.S.P., Mötley Crüe, and Ice Cube for so many years only made him more curious. The former presidential candidate claimed that finally hearing them all for the first time was "like having [his] brains shot into outer space." "I can't believe I wasted half my life helping Tipper put warning labels on this stuff when I could have been seeing these guys do their thing live," Gore said of W.A.S.P. "They used to whip raw meat at the audience. How bad-ass is that?" "Cause I'm burning, burning, burning up with fi-ire! " added Gore, screaming the lyrics to "Wild Child." According to Gore's personal assistant Eric Linscott, the Nobel Peace Prize winner has been spending most of each workday gorging himself on the songs "On Your Knees," "The Torture Never Stops," and "Show No Mercy." "I spent six hours at Best Buy yesterday trying to find these Quiet Riot and N.W.A. albums he was asking for," said Linscott, who claimed he also purchased a mirror etched with the AC/DC logo for Gore's home office. "Whenever I try to talk to him about upcoming meetings or something, he just makes this, like, devil symbol with his hands or starts air-drumming. I'm really hoping this is just a phase." Sources confirmed that Gore has also been catching up on movies that Tipper would not allow the 62-year-old to view because they contained violence, adult language, or nudity. He recently finished watching Purple Rain nearly 26 years after his wife forced him to turn it off because the song "Darling Nikki" contains references to masturbation. Gore also announced plans to stay up all night watching Porky's, Fast Times At Ridgemont High, Red Dawn, and The Terminator. "Why would I need Tipper when I've got all this?" said Gore, gesturing toward stacks of compact discs, vinyl albums, VHS cassettes, DVDs, and Nintendo games. "I'll tell you one thing: If she thinks I miss her, then she's out of her mind, because I don't. I'm living the dream here, my friend. I'm not lonely at all." Added Gore, "Not lonely at all." In related news, family sources reported that Tipper Gore has been enjoying her newfound freedom by taking 20-minute showers and leaving the lights on all day.

Area Man Excited Friend Is Getting Divorced
PASCO, WA — Jim Sterling, 31, reported Monday that he's excited to resume his friendship with his soon-to-be-divorced buddy Andy Freiburg. "Awesome," Sterling said, shortly after learning that Freiburg was divorcing Katie Burello, his wife of four years. "The Ster-Frei combo is back in action! Sterling and Freiburg became friends when they roomed together as freshmen at the University of Washington, and they remained friends after college, with Sterling serving as a groomsman at the couple's 2000 wedding. However, after Freiburg was married, Sterling said he and his friend rarely socialized without Burello present. "Katie's all right, I guess," said Sterling, who has never been in a relationship for longer than three months. "But she really kept Andy on a tight leash. After the wedding, I only got to see Andy about once a month, and Katie almost always tagged along. And she'd always cut the night short with some excuse, like that she had to get up for work. Sterling said Freiburg just wasn't himself when his wife was present. "Whenever Katie was around, Andy would get all boring," Sterling said. "He wouldn't do shots; he'd just sit there sipping on a light beer. He'd never use our catch phrases or talk about the dumb stuff we did in college, either. Instead, he'd drone on about some computer-animation project he was doing or some boring thing going on in his neighborhood. "Well, this divorce proves what I've said all along: You can't drag a party animal like Andy out to the sticks and expect him to turn into Joe Suburb," Sterling said. "It's only a matter of time before the full moon rises. I'm sure that's why things didn't work out with Katie." Sterling said he'd noticed Freiburg reverting to his pre-marital self over recent months. "Andy never talked about Katie, but I knew something was up, because suddenly he was going out without her a lot more often," Sterling said. "He'd stay out later, and one night he even crashed at my place and called in sick to work. When he told me that he and Katie were separating, I was like, 'It's about time!' Sterling has been helping Freiburg during his time of need by cleaning his apartment and scouting out area taverns in search of good happy-hour drink specials. "Andy's going to need a place to stay, and I have a couch with his name on it," Sterling said. "It'll be so cool to have him crash here. It'll be just like when we were in college. We can stay up all night and make fun of infomercials, and we can watch all the games together. It's going to be great. Sterling said he's been rounding up other college friends, as well. "Will's still single, and Dave lost his job the other day — talk about good timing," Sterling said. "Maybe we can start up our dart league again. We were the kings of Hunter's Pub." Sterling said he's especially looking forward to "hitting the singles market" with his newly available friend. "I figure he'll need at least a week to get himself back together, so during that time, we'll just drink at home and go to movies," Sterling said. "But after that, look out! I gotta admit, it's been pretty dry in my neck of the woods. He'll be getting all that rebound action, and I'll be there to collect his cast-off pity sex. Freiburg, who has not yet heard any of Sterling's plans, was contacted for comment at his brother Dale's house, where he has been staying since Sunday. "I feel worse than I ever have in my entire life," Freiburg said. "When I'm not working, I'm packing. When I'm not packing, I'm talking to my lawyer. When I'm not talking to my lawyer, I'm crying. It feels like everything is falling apart around me. I just want to be alone.

Woman Married To Fat, Emotionally Distant Vampire Escapes Into 'Twilight' Novels
NEW ORLEANS — Acknowledging years of marital dissatisfaction and a noticeable increase in her vampire husband's weight, 43-year-old Sara Pastor told reporters Thursday that she often seeks solace by losing herself in the escapist fantasy of the Twilight novels. The New Orleans resident said it's been ages since her husband, 834-year-old Andrei Pastor, bought her flowers, took her dancing, or appeared at her second-story window and charmed her into allowing him inside. According to Sara, she purchased the first book in Stephenie Meyer's young-adult vampire romance series 14 months ago, while waiting for her husband to pick her up from the airport, and has taken refuge in the novels ever since. "Edward is so romantic," said Pastor, referring to Edward Cullen, Twilight's vampire hero. "He loves [17-year-old protagonist] Bella so much that he runs away from her to protect her. My husband, on the other hand, hasn't posed any kind of danger to me in years. "Sometimes I wish I could just open up the pages and jump right into Bella's skin," Sara continued. "I know it's silly, but what's wrong with wanting a little romance and adventure from your undead husband? Sara and Andrei met in 1988, when, as college students, they both volunteered to organize a campus blood drive. Sara reportedly found Andrei's nocturnal lifestyle exotic and thrilling, and two years later, they were married in a nighttime ceremony guests described as a "storybook wedding. At first Sara was content with her role as homemaker, cleaning the vast Gothic manse the couple shared and cooking meals that met the strict sanguinary requirements of Andrei's diet. But according to friends, things started to change a few years ago. Sara's dream husband began spending more and more time secluded in darkened alcoves with his cape drawn over his face. Before long, Andrei — once a stealthy hunter who easily stalked young and healthy prey — started feeding excessively on any slow-moving person who happened to wander by the house, and soon ballooned to almost twice his normal weight. "When we were first married, Andrei was so dark and mysterious," Pastor said wistfully. "These days, pretty much all he does is sit around swilling blood and watching ESPN." Added Pastor, "Edward would never do that to Bella." Now, sources close to the couple report, whenever Andrei leaves the house to feast on the vital fluids of a bedridden shut-in, Sara retreats to the fictional world of Forks, WA, often reading and rereading the same erotic passages from her dog-eared copy of Breaking Dawn. "Arizona, Italy, Brazil — Edward Cullen travels everywhere for his love," said Pastor, sounding increasingly flustered. "Anytime I want to visit my family in Houston or go on a vacation, Andrei gives me the same old line: 'Sorry, but I can't risk being caught out in the sunlight.' Well, that sure didn't stop him back in 1895 when he came over here from Eastern Europe." According to Sara, by last year she felt so cooped up that she took a job at a local Olive Garden "just to get out of the house. " She woke each morning at 10 a.m. and came home at dusk, her clothes still smelling of garlic. It wasn't long before the two started sleeping in separate coffins. "Every time I get to the part where Edward reveals himself to Bella in the sunlight, I start to cry," Pastor said. "Edward is so beautiful, his skin begins to sparkle in the sun. The closest Andrei ever comes to sparkling is when sweat beads up on his chunky thighs after he's climbed a flight of stairs. Though sources confirm Andrei won't entertain the idea of a divorce, it's uncertain how long the marriage can last under these conditions. "If Sara wants to live in her little fantasy world all the time, that's her choice," Andrei Pastor, Vicomte of Bazargic, said when reached for comment. "She might think life is just one big fairy tale, but it's not. Added the vampire, "I've been around 800 years, and I think I know a thing or two about the real world.

A Classic Jason Somehow Gets Mixed Into Area Man's Anecdote Collection
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA — While regaling guests at a house party Saturday, 31-year-old Phil Carver acknowledged that a classic Jason had somehow found its way into his usual repertoire of personal anecdotes. "I was halfway through the story when I realized, 'Hey, what am I saying? This is definitely a Jason I'm telling right now,"' said Carver, who was "baffled" as to how he had missed the telltale marks of a classic Jason and mistaken it for his own. "I felt especially bad because it was the road-trip-through-Tennessee-back-in- college Jason, which is a signature Jason through and through. " After Carver went home, several partygoers were overheard remarking that the embarrassing faux pas was vintage Phil.

Movie Theater Employee Hurt By Customer's Comments About High Price Of Popcorn
PORTLAND, OR — Regal Lloyd Center 10 Cinema employee Justine Terrin told reporters Friday that a customer had deeply hurt her feelings by complaining aloud about the price of popcorn. "I was absolutely shattered — what on earth would make a person say something like that? " said Terrin, recounting how the customer turned to his friend and said $5 for a small bag of popcorn was "a little ridiculous. " "The most devastating part was that he obviously knew I could hear what he was saying, and he didn't even care. It shook me to my core.

Enchanting Evening Spent With Parents, Friends Of Parents
LANSDALE, PA — According to delighted reports, 25-year-old Brian Hatcher spent a most exquisite Saturday evening in the enchanting company of not only his parents, Mike, 54, and Diane, 53, but also their dear friends and longtime canasta partners Doug and Trudy Blanchard, both 53. "I was home for the weekend, and the Blanchards came over for dinner one night," said Hatcher, describing how his family's charming neighbors came calling early Friday evening, bearing a selection of generous gifts that included brownies and exotic ales imported from faraway Canada. "I hadn't seen them in a couple years. "They looked good," added Hatcher, referring to the regal lady and her dignified husband, respectively clad in a stunning rose-pink tracksuit and a crisp Philadelphia Flyers tee. After exchanging formal greetings in the Hatchers' mudroom, the guests were ushered to the tastefully appointed dining room table — bedecked with a dazzling, floral-print tablecloth — where they sat in the intimate glow of a nearby halogen floor lamp. And just as quickly as ceremonious salutations gave way to witty, off-the-cuff repartee, the sumptuous multicourse fare began to be served. "Mom put out some snacks," said Hatcher, recalling the bounteous tray of premium mixed nuts and an elegant fan of Townhouse crackers set upon the breakfast bar. "Which was good, because I think everyone was getting pretty hungry. Hatcher's reports indicate that the assorted hors d'oeuvres served to whet the appetites of everyone gathered there, while the enticing aroma of the pièce de résistance, chicken noodle casserole, tickled at their noses. "I was actually supposed to head out to the Lyric Lounge with my old high school buddy Kevin [Devaney], but he ended up having to work," said Hatcher, pondering the pedestrian night of carousing that would have ensued had fate not intervened and bestowed upon him such a wondrous evening. "Dinner was good. Mr. Blanchard told a bunch of jokes. They looked like they were having a good time. As the assemblage feasted on the luxurious entrée, all were transported with bliss by the lengthy discourse regarding the Hatcher family's vegetable garden. In a particularly spellbinding monologue, the evening's hostess wowed her audience with an anecdote of good fortune turned sour, detailing how her overly prolific tomato plants bore luscious fruit, but in such devastating quantities that she and her husband soon grew tired of tomatoes and tomato-based dishes. "I thought about going down to the basement after dinner to watch a movie or something, but they don't have the DVD player set up down there anymore," said Hatcher, acknowledging that he had been unprepared for such lively rapid-fire dialogue, which danced seamlessly between his father's detailed descriptions of their new hot-water heater and Trudy Blanchard's pitch-perfect retellings of that week's bout with fatigue at work. "And I didn't bring my Xbox 360 with me. After everyone had sated themselves upon a lavish dessert that featured not one, but two of the choicest Turkey Hill ice creams, they retired to the sitting room for a game of Scattergories, whereupon the evening reportedly took a turn toward the bawdy when Doug Blanchard unveiled a delightfully risqué quip about a particular waitress who had recently served him, leaving the entire gathering titillated and dizzily gleeful. Decorum was eventually restored, however, when Mrs. Hatcher broached the sobering yet engrossing subject of her recent blood work. Time, as is its wont, seemed to pass swiftly, Hatcher claimed, and before even a soul had noticed, it was nigh on 9:40. At such a late hour, the evening's honored guests declared, with a mixture of satisfaction and reservation, they must "call it a night. After a succession of farewells and warm embraces, the distinguished couple made their departure, but not without leaving behind them a most pleasing collection of memories for all in attendance to cherish. "Huh," said Hatcher, still a bit dazed from the evening's overwhelming enchantment, "I think Mrs. Blanchard left her reading glasses here.

Rural South Dakotan Walks Away From First Encounter With Jewish Man, Shaken But Unharmed
SELBY, SD — According to local resident Hank Tyson's firsthand account, the 51-year-old service-shop owner was left rattled but unharmed Wednesday after engaging in small talk with a man who turned out to be Jewish. "It seemed like any other conversation at first, but once I realized he was Jewish, I could feel my blood pressure go up and everything started moving in slow motion," said Tyson, claiming the sequence of events that followed "felt like some kind of awful dream," from the man's subtle gesturing to his repeated questions about how to get to I-94. "You never think anything like this will happen to you until it does. " Following the encounter, Tyson drove home, kissed his wife, and told his children he loved them.

No Reason You Can't Be Chiropractor Like Your Cousin Jeffrey
He Makes A Very Nice Living DAVENPORT, IA — Sources confirmed Tuesday that if you just apply yourself and refocus your energy toward something a little more concrete, there is absolutely nothing holding you back from becoming a successful chiropractor like your cousin Jeffrey. Jeffrey, 32, who reportedly works long but not crazy hours, and started his own practice a year after graduating from chiropractic school, makes a very comfortable living. According to your Aunt Sharon, Jeffrey is his own boss, he can take vacation time whenever he wants, and people call him "doctor." Sources have urged you to look at Jeffrey, just look at him with his house and lawn and all that new chiropractic equipment he was talking about last Thanksgiving, and don't think for a second that couldn't be you. Sources added that you have always been just as smart, if not smarter, than Jeffrey. Though records indicate you typically roll your eyes at the mention of your cousin, often saying, "Jeffrey, Jeffrey, always with Jeffrey," those familiar with the situation have urged you to just calm down and listen for a second. The website www. salarywizard.com, which is a good one, confirmed that the average yearly income for a chiropractor is $85,000 — a figure that would get you out of that one-bedroom apartment of yours, and is admittedly a lot more than what you make at the restaurant you've been at for, what is it now, six years? Sources know you asked your brother Max for a $2,000 loan last week. Is everything okay? Further research revealed that chiropractors specialize in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of mechanical disorders of what's called the musculoskeletal system, which is perfect because you always loved science in† school. Being a chiropractor reportedly sounds very interesting and is probably something you would be excellent at if you took it seriously like Jeffrey, who has a nice haircut, and more than one decent suit, and look at him now on that bus ad. Jeffrey is reportedly thinking about adding a patio to his backyard next summer. Born in 1978, Jeffrey is three years younger than you, not that that matters. After graduating from Iowa State, which you could have easily attended had you worked a little harder in high school, Jeffrey enrolled at Palmer Chiropractic College, where, according to his wife Diane, he still has an in. He has two children, Matt, 4, and Grace, 2. Don't you want kids someday? While you have adamantly stated in prior conversations that you do not care about the amount of money Jeffrey makes and that you are not impressed by the new 56-inch television he had installed in his bedroom — plasma, by the way — you have been begged not to walk away from this conversation because this is reportedly important. If you don't want to be a chiropractor like Jeffrey, sources claim that's fine, but what about going into sales like your sister Amanda, or doing something with your hands like your friend Greg. Greg is also doing quite well for himself after he finally got his act together, sources confirmed. Look, those with knowledge of the situation said, you have to do something with your life because the truth of the matter is that you are not getting any younger. You should, at the very least, talk to Jeffrey or, sources maintained, see if maybe he needs an assistant or something. At press time, if you don't call him then it's your own fault.

Townsfolk Strongly Prefer Man's Werewolf Incarnation
'Jesus, The Next Full Moon Can't Come Fast Enough,' Villagers Report BLACK FOREST, GERMANY — Townsfolk told reporters Tuesday that they can't wait for the next full moon, as they much prefer the bloodthirsty lycanthropic form of "insufferable" local blacksmith Hans Meyer, who was bitten by a werewolf eight months ago. "We may lose a few sheep or cattle every month, but it's worth it to get a break from that guy's constant bitching," said candlemaker Fritz Hermann, adding that at least when Meyer is a werewolf he doesn't have that annoying laugh. "He's always going on and on at the tavern about the subtle differences between re-shodding a Clydesdale versus a Westphalian, or whining about how someone needs to chain him up because he doesn't know what he'll do — God, I'd much rather deal with an unholy half-man, half-wolf trying to rip out my throat." The town council is reportedly at a loss as to how to rid the village of Meyer, considering that no one is willing to get close enough to stab him with a silver dagger for fear of being trapped in an endless conversation about his stupid fucking cuckoo clock collection.

Employees Suspect Old Man Came To Roy Rogers To Die
ALLENTOWN, PA — According to morning-shift employees at the Roy Rogers restaurant off Route 114, the elderly man seated alone in the back corner booth appears to be intent on dying there. "He came shuffling in really slowly this morning and just sort of slumped over there in the back," said cashier Brianne Pecor, 17, who claimed the old man has ordered nothing in the past two hours but a small cup of coffee. "It's pretty heartbreaking to watch. Guess the poor old guy doesn't have much of an appetite left. He's probably just looking for a calm, quiet corner where he can curl up and pass away. "They can sense when their time is coming," Pecor added. "They just know. The frail-looking senior citizen has reportedly been sitting alone, unclaimed, for the past few hours, during which time restaurant sources said he has hardly moved. Although the man chose to settle at a partially concealed table in the darkest corner of the restaurant, workers told reporters that the figure has been impossible to ignore, largely due to his labored struggles for breath and frequent hacking coughs. "He let out a really heavy sigh a little while ago, so Brianne went over to check on him," said morning-shift manager Dan Plumley, 36. "But he kind of turned his head away and cowered a little when she approached him. "At this stage, it's probably best to just leave him be," Plumley continued. "Let him go in peace, you know? Since arriving at the Roy Rogers location some three hours ago, the elderly man has reportedly taken only a few meager sips from his coffee, and has hardly averted his gaze from the restaurant's back window. "He's got a nice view from where he's sitting," Plumley said. "He can see the trees rustling in the breeze out past the parking lot, and he can watch the cars go by on Benton Road. I think it must really be a pleasant, soothing sight for him. Added Plumley, "A nice way to go. Roy Rogers patrons have also reportedly maintained a respectful distance from the man by sitting at booths and tables on the opposite side of the restaurant. When passing by the slumped figure on their way to the restroom, most have made an attempt to avoid looking directly into the senior's eyes. "It looks like he's dressed up for some special occasion or something, like he knew this was the end," said diner Matthew Brunelle, 44, referring to the man's polished leather penny loafers, neatly pressed brown slacks, and gray cardigan. "It makes you sad, in a way, but then again I guess it's all just part of the cycle of life. In an effort to make the senior's final moments on earth as comfortable as possible, the restaurant staff postponed mopping the floor around him and, when they noticed the old man's frail, arthritic fingers struggling to fasten the top button of his sweater, dialed the thermostat up a few degrees. At press time, employees of the Roy Rogers location claimed that if the man hadn't passed on by closing time, they would leave a little water and some chili out for him and then come back to check on him in the morning.

Man Read Somewhere They Proved Thing He Just Made Up
BALTIMORE — After being questioned about the thing he had just made up in conversation Tuesday, 37-year-old Paul Rosada explained to those around him that, not only was his fabrication true, but he had recently read somewhere that it had been definitively proven. "You didn't hear about that? " asked Rosada, saying he probably still had the article at home, though he might have thrown it out. "It's probably online. I'll send you a link. " Rosada added he was particularly surprised no one knew about the thing he had completely invented because he heard on the radio that they were making a documentary about it.

97-Year-Old Dies Unaware Of Being Violin Prodigy
ROCKFORD, IL — Retired post office branch manager Nancy Hollander, 97, died at her home of natural causes Tuesday, after spending her life completely unaware that she was one of the most talented musicians of the past century and possessed the untapped ability to become a world-class violin virtuoso. She is survived by two daughters, a son, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren, all of whom will forever remain oblivious to the national treasure Hollander would have become had she just picked up a violin even once. "We're really going to miss Mom — she was such a gentle, sensitive, perceptive person," said Hollander's son, David, unknowingly outlining qualities that would have infused his mother's interpretation of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto with a singular, haunting beauty capable of moving the most jaded of souls. "Even though she never drew attention to herself, Mom had such a strong, commanding presence. "I swear, she should have been an actress or something," he added. Former colleagues at the U.S. Post Office branch where Hollander worked for 40 years also fondly remembered the unexploited musical genius who, had she ever taken in hand a freshly rosined bow, would have instead been fondly remembered by various musical luminaries and heads of state in a special three-hour tribute concert on PBS. "Nancy was the most gracious person I ever met," said retired coworker Geraldine Hunter, 82, echoing nearly verbatim what Pope John Paul II would have said after inviting Hollander to play at the Vatican in 1989. "She really lived every day to its fullest, and I don't think she could have been blessed with a better life. Hunter also recalled Hollander's humility when being promoted to manager — the highlight of Hollander's professional life, as opposed to playing the Franck Sonata at Carnegie Hall accompanied by world-renowned pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy as Itzhak Perlman wept openly with sheer joy from the front row. According to sources, Hollander was very active in her church. Pastor Frank Davis said that she took the most joy in singing with the choir during holiday masses, an experience she would have found a hellish, atonal cacophony had she completed the highest level of ear-training at The Juilliard School, where she could have received a full scholarship based entirely on the strength of her student audition. "To be honest, she didn't have the best singing voice in the world," Davis said. "But she really put her heart and soul into it, and she had an uncanny ability to sing any hymn all the way through perfectly after hearing it just once. Davis also praised the potato salad Hollander brought to church picnics, heartbreakingly referring to it as "world famous. Perhaps most distraught by Hollander's passing were her great-grandchildren, who seemed to have some dim perception of being robbed — along with the rest of the world — of their great-grandmother's tour de force performances in rapt concert halls from Vienna to Tokyo. "Grammy was really funny, like when she would play silly songs on the ukulele to make us laugh," said Lilly, 6, referring to the instrument purchased for Hollander on her seventh birthday in 1920, her father having paused momentarily in the music store to consider a violin. "I miss her a lot. "When I grow up, I want to play the ukulele just like Grammy," Lilly added.

Kid Ready To Start Playdating Again
TAMPA, FL — Despite having been hurt more times than he can count, local kindergartner Kyle Gallagher told reporters this week that he's finally ready to get out there and start playdating again. Gallagher, whose last serious relationship ended three months ago, said his decision to meet new children and return to the playdating scene wasn't easy. "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous — after all, it's been a while since I've played spacemen with someone else," Gallagher said between small sips from a grape-juice box. "But I just can't worry about that kind of thing anymore. It's time to get back on that horse and see what's out there for me. "I mean, I'm almost five and a half," he added. "I'm not getting any younger. According to sources close to Gallagher, the small child has focused on keeping himself busy in recent weeks by drawing pictures of ninjas and searching for hidden treasures in hopes of distracting himself from the pain of his recent breakup. Despite his efforts to forget about Jeremy and the time the two spent together jumping up and down on his bed, Gallagher admitted Monday that he missed having someone to share the things in his life with, be they his electric train set, or the "giant, pointy sticks" he would oftentimes find in his backyard. "The playdating scene can be shallow, and you meet a lot of kids who won't think twice before lying to your face, but there's got to be that special someone out there somewhere," Gallagher said. "Look, I'm not going to say that it's not hard, because it is. But what am I supposed to do? Sit in the corner and cry all day? Added Gallagher, "Trust me, I've done that already. Saying that all that he wants is someone to practice handstands with, or someone who has the same favorite color in common, the 5-year-old told reporters that he was just going to take things one step at a time. "I'm not looking to get into anything serious right away," Gallagher said. "I'm not necessarily ready to open up about my dreams of becoming a fireman or someday owning a trampoline, but it'll be nice not to be alone anymore. "Just as long as they treat me with respect, I'll be happy," he added. "I'm tired of playing games. Gallagher said that his mother, Samantha, has been an additional source of frustration, due to her active role in his personal life. "I keep telling her I'm fine on my own, that I'll start playdating again when the time is right," Gallagher said. "But she's always nagging me about this person or the other that she wants me to meet. I know she means well, but, give me a break. She treats me like a baby. Despite the many challenges that lie ahead, Gallagher told reporters that he remained optimistic about finding a new best friend. "Next year I'll be in first grade, and I'm starting swim classes, so I'll have some options," he said. "I just don't want to come off as desperate. I want to have fun, learn how to write, and maybe even get a puppy dog named Oscar. If I have time to dive into a new relationship, then great. "After all, playdating is like riding a bike," Gallagher added. "Whatever that's like.

Wise Council Of Elders Accuses Day Nurse Of Stealing Change
GLENS FALLS, NY — An esteemed high council of elders gathered in the hushed chambers of the Hillside Assisted Living Center this week to determine the fate of Wanda Drexler, a 43-year-old day nurse suspected of stealing loose change from atop various dressers and nightstands. The venerable tribunal, which convenes every day for Social Time, was reportedly alerted to the grave transgression at 11:30 a.m. Following a luncheon feast of turkey meatloaf and steamed mixed vegetables, the Nine Great Sages delivered their unanimous ruling. "She took it," intoned learned elder and high council leader Bernard Goldman, speaking from his cushioned seat in the Hillside activities lounge. "She came into my room when I was getting my bath and she took my change. And then she turned down the thermostat when I wasn't looking. Added the wise man, "It's cold in my room now. Trusted consul and word-search enthusiast Ruth Wurster immediately concurred. "Oh, that awful woman — -she doesn't fool me, not for a second," Wurster declared. "There were two quarters in my purse before and now they're gone. I want them back. I want my quarters back! The assembled elders then murmured their agreement in sage, muted tones. The council, whose judicious members have a combined 754 years of worldly knowledge and experience, have delivered a number of solemn proclamations in recent months, including soundly reasoned decrees on issues such as pillow placement, what day today is, and why everyone on the television is so rude all the time. Sources said the august body, whose members defer only to the rules of the Hillside events calendar and their visiting grandchildren, have been troubled greatly by the developing day nurse situation, often pondering the matter until well into the 6 p.m. movie. "No, no, not the Oriental nurse, the colored one," elder Tom Stansell said before shutting his eyes and somberly bowing his head in silence for the next 35 minutes. "Always telling me what to do. I have rights, you know. In addition to the coin thefts, Hillside day nurse Wanda Drexler also faces judgment from the council on a wide-ranging list of grievous offenses, from trying to turn their families against them, to not speaking up. "I asked her for more tapioca pudding after dinner and she said no," professed elder Mary Lou Stevenson in a stern address to her fellow council members. "I'm a grown woman, for Pete's sake, I can have tapioca pudding whenever I damn well please. "And I don't want my slippers by the door — if she puts them by the door then I can't reach them from my bed and my feet get cold," Stevenson continued. "She's a very clumsy woman. I don't like her at all. Having carefully reached its verdict after much thoughtful deliberation, the council of elders determined that severe reprisals would almost certainly be in order, and that the day nurse would need to be held accountable for her unconscionable actions. However, when confronted by revered elder Donald Roeder with the serious charges brought against her, the accused offered little in the way of contrition. "Now, now, Mr. Roeder," Drexler said as she placed an electric blanket over the venerable sage's arms and chest. "That's enough for tonight.

"I just hope they can break through my blocked memories and get rid of any underlying guilt in time.

Report: No One At White Castle Wants To Make Friends
DETROIT — A new report compiled at the Gratiot Avenue White Castle late Saturday night found that none of the eatery's patrons possessed any enthusiasm to meet new people. Data compiled between the hours of 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. in the restaurant's dining room revealed a zero percent interest in friendly chatter, group sing-alongs, exchanging bites of sandwiches, tabletop drum circles, or any other social activity. An equal percentage displayed no interest in posing for cell-phone photographs, with 11 percent hissing angrily when asked. According to the report, the only person in the building who exhibited any signs of friendliness was the shift manager, but even he wasn't interested in going back to the apartment and watching a bunch of UFC matches.

Work Friend Accidentally Becomes Real Friend
ATLANTA — Despite making no deliberate efforts to engage with his coworker beyond the point of pleasant acquaintance, Eric Phipps said Thursday he was astonished to discover he had inadvertently forged a personal bond with fellow web developer Michael Jenkins. Phipps, 31, told reporters that the interactions with his coworker, which for two years had been confined to job-related matters and breezy small talk, first took an unplanned turn toward authentic friendship this past March. According to Phipps, he and Jenkins happened to leave the office at the same time one day and decided to kill half an hour at a nearby bar before heading off to separate evening engagements. "I figured we'd just talk about work stuff for a little bit and then be on our way," said Phipps, adding that he wasn't even sure at the time if Jenkins drank. "But next thing I knew, he was telling me about the problems he's having with his pool, and I was promising to lend him my copy of The Wild Bunch." "And the bizarre thing is, I was legitimately enjoying myself," added Phipps, citing his coworker's intelligence and sense of humor as well as the surprising abundance of interests they shared. "How did this happen? While Phipps assumed that his collegial but limited relationship with Jenkins would resume once they were back at the office, he soon realized it would be impossible to interact with his coworker in the surface-level, noncommittal way he was accustomed to. †"It's like everything had shifted," Phipps said. "All of a sudden, I was stopping by his cubicle to ask about his woodworking project, and he was at mine giving me the name of a good chiropractor my sister should try for her back spasms. Then somehow I suddenly had his personal e-mail address. Even as long lunches with Jenkins became an everyday activity, Phipps told reporters he never expected their camaraderie to extend past the "best friend at the office" level. But that barrier was shattered last Thursday, when Phipps' neighborhood softball team needed an extra player for their weekend game. "I got a call from the captain asking if I knew anyone who could sub in, and before I could stop myself, I told him I had a buddy who used to play in college," said Phipps, referring to the man he once knew only as "polo-shirt guy. " "I called him my buddy. I didn't say 'coworker' or even 'buddy from work.' I said buddy. That's something you say about an actual friend. It was perhaps that escalation, Phipps acknowledged, that cleared the path for Jenkins to invite him to a barbecue a couple of weeks later — an event whose guests did not include any other coworkers. Not until he was bouncing Jenkins' 4-year-old daughter on his knee did Phipps realize the full impact of the unintentional befriending. "No going back now," Phipps said. "There's been talk of carpooling, and he mentioned a cabin he owns near a good fishing spot. He'll probably end up being godfather to one of my kids. When reached for comment, Jenkins readily acknowledged his relationship with Phipps. "Yeah, Phippsy's a great guy," Jenkins said. "Though he tends to over think things.

Money Spent For Old Time's Sake
BROCKWAY, PA — Harkening back to an abandoned custom that had long existed only in memory, 28-year-old unemployed graphic designer Leslie Gordon exchanged currency for physical goods at a local shopping establishment Friday. "I was reminiscing about all the good times I used to have buying things with money, so I figured why not give it another go? " said Gordon, happily reliving the once-common act of selecting an item of her choosing, taking it to the register for payment, and then becoming its sole owner. "Look, they even still have those barcodes like I remember. " As a result of her nostalgic splurge, Gordon will be forced to subsist entirely on maple-syrup- flavored Quaker Oats until next week.

Nation's Slicked-Back-Hair Men Rally Against Negative Hollywood Portrayal
LOS ANGELES — Thousands of members of the slicked-back-hair community gathered in Hollywood Monday to protest the film industry's longtime trend of depicting men with slicked-back hair as untrustworthy, unlikeable antagonists. "There have been 4,192 films in the past 10 years in which male characters with sleek or slicked-back hairstyles have been portrayed in a negative light," said Ray Swartz, chairman of the National Organization of Men with Slicked-Back Hair. "Even though men with this hairstyle comprise just 3 percent of the U.S. populace, they make up nearly 80 percent of all film and TV villains, bad guys, and just plain assholes. As a result, thousands of men who enjoy wetting their hair and then combing it straight back face a silent but pervasive form of discrimination every single day. "I'm just a man with slicked-back hair," Swartz added. "Does that make me a sleazeball? According to statistics released by the organization, five out of every six characters with slicked-back hair are cast as the primary antagonist. Of this group, 29 percent are depicted as greedy and manipulative Wall Street sharks, 22 percent as cold, emotionless murderers, 19 percent as evil coaches or mentors, 12 percent as corrupt mafiosi, 8 percent as undead creatures who feast on human blood, and the remaining 10 percent fall into the general category of jerks/pricks/John Travolta. More alarming, Swartz said, is that certain subsets of slicked-back-hair Americans endure even worse prejudices. He cited men with slicked-back hair who also talk with cigarettes dangling out of their mouths, wear blue button-down shirts with white collars, or place toothpicks behind their right ears as the most victimized. "Just because I have heavily gelled, jet-black, slicked-back hair does not mean I can't lead a normal, productive life," Kettering, OH native Martin Sutulovich said. "I'm not consumed by an insatiable thirst for power, I know nothing about the high-pressure world of real-estate speculation, and I have a wife and kids whom I love very much. The last thing I want to do is murder them, cut them up into tiny pieces, bag them up, and put them out with the trash, but when strangers look at me, that's all they think. A recent study conducted by Swartz's group indicates that Americans who slick back their hair usually experience typical development, have life spans equal to those without slicked-back hair, and are no more likely to stoically torture people with medical instruments than the average dry-haired citizen. "You always see crooked lawyers and politicians with slicked-back hair in the movies, but when was the last time you saw a computer programmer with slicked-back hair, a farmer who built a magical baseball field in a cornfield with slicked-back hair, or a man who defused a bomb at the last possible second to save thousands of innocent lives with slicked-back hair? " Swartz said. "Never." "The closest thing we've ever gotten to a hero is Steven Seagal or that Spanish neighbor guy on Sanford And Son," he added. "And Seagal's hair is pulled back into a ponytail, so he doesn't even really count. Swartz also pointed out that even females who appear in films with slicked-back hair often end up transforming into aliens who have sex with people and then kill them. "I have naturally oily hair. If I leave it dry, it ends up messy by the end of the day, so I slick it back," Doug Roessner of Brockton, MA said. "I sell insurance for a living, so how am I supposed to get my clients to trust me when they all think I'm some money-hungry scumbag? And every time I tell my bosses that I'll 'take care of' a problem, they immediately assume I mean murdering someone. It's pathetic. "My son hasn't been the same around me since he watched D2: The Mighty Ducks last month," said slicked-back-hair man Mick Romanini, referencing the film in which coach Gordon Bombay slicks back his hair when consumed by fame, then wears it dry again upon realizing the error of his ways. "Is this what we want to teach our children about slicked-back hair? Added Romanini, "He should be able to do whatever he wants with his hair when he gets older and not worry that people are going to assume he's the kind of guy who would plot his best friend's death and then seduce the widow to get his hands on the insurance money. In interviews, studio executives have countered the protests by citing a number of realistic and sympathetic characters with slicked-back hair, including James Bond, Superman, and Data from Star Trek. But Swartz rejects such claims. After closer examination, he said, Bond's hair is slicked "more to the side than back," Data is not a human being, and Superman has a distinct curl of hair that falls on his forehead, which his group considers a different hairstyle altogether. Hollywood is facing similar protests from groups such as the National Association of Maniacal Laughers, the American Mustache-Twirlers Coalition, and the Alliance of Gentlemen with Scars and Eye Patches.

Chimp In Cocaine Study Starts Lying To Friends
ATLANTA — Concerned workers at the National Primate Research Center said Bobo, a 5-year-old chimpanzee participating in a 16-month cocaine study, was observed this week lying to the faces of friends, family, and staff. "Our goal was to determine how large doses of the stimulant would improve or impair the chimpanzee's ability to perform memory and language tasks," said primatologist Daniel Martin, the project's lead researcher. "What we found was that cocaine not only disrupted Bobo's concentration and recall, but it also caused him to lie, cheat, and emotionally manipulate those around him. Continued Martin, "Essentially, Bobo has become an asshole. According to researchers, initial results of the study were promising, with Bobo energetically completing cognition tests in record times. Within weeks, however, he reportedly began to develop violent mood swings, delusions of grandeur, and other troubling behaviors, such as begging his fellow participants to let him take their place in line so he could score a double dose of the drug he craved. Witnesses said that once Bobo began taking advantage of the chimps in his life, family and friends further enabled his behavior by always giving him "one last chance. "How many times can Bobo aggressively lash out at them, become contrite, act sorrowful, and then lash out again before they realize he has a problem? " research assistant Karen Grant said. "His life is spinning out of control, and they need to confront him about it. If they don't, one day they'll find him facedown under the tire swing — dead from an overdose. By the third week of the study, Bobo had turned to theft to feed his growing habit: The addicted primate was observed stealing bananas from his loved ones, lying about it, and then attempting to conceal his misdeed by actually pretending to help them search for the missing fruit. "Deceitful behaviors such as theft are highly unusual for primates," Martin said. "But the fact that Bobo approached us that same night and tried to exchange the stolen bananas for more cocaine is what's truly astonishing. "It's like he's a different Bobo now," he added. Early in the study, Bobo's elevated mood and excessive chattering made him quite popular among the other chimpanzees. But researchers claimed that his increased irritability, short temper, and absenteeism at the jungle gym did not go unnoticed. According to laboratory sources, when Martin and his team began injecting Bobo with highly concentrated solutions of cocaine, the chimp took to skipping meals altogether, often covering up for his lack of appetite by signing to friends that he had eaten a big lunch that day and wasn't hungry. Last February, Bobo reportedly grew so self-deluded that he believed he had become the group's alpha male. In reality, however, his rank in the dominance hierarchy had reached a new low, especially after several cocaine-fueled episodes in which he threatened other males and then made forceful, awkward advances toward uninterested females. "It was embarrassing," Martin said. "A lot of our researchers have been unable to look at Bobo the same way since. Chimp sources confirmed that in recent weeks Bobo has stopped hanging out with friends in the control group, who only receive a placebo. "Fight. Mad. Bobo. Please more juice drink," Pipa, a 6-year-old chimpanzee, told reporters by pressing symbols on a specially designed keyboard. "Pipa scared. Old Bobo. We want back. Claiming they don't even know who the chimpanzee is anymore, researchers hypothesized that the constant ingestion of cocaine may have taken a physical toll on Bobo, who now staggers around on all fours, grunts nonsensically, and has been spotted trying to groom insects that aren't actually there. Martin acknowledged that Bobo's cognitive abilities have also suffered, saying that the restless primate no longer shows any interest in finishing his assigned tasks and often does little more than flip off the researchers. "We definitely didn't teach him to do that," Martin said. "That's totally the cocaine. As of press time, Bobo was reportedly sprawled out on the floor of the laboratory, begging for more cocaine and offering to give researchers hand jobs in exchange for some.

'Athletes Can Play Through Those Injuries,' Says Man Who Gets Sore From Sitting Too Long
NEW YORK — Despite his incessant complaints that resting his buttocks on a chair for prolonged periods of time causes him discomfort and pain, a man paid to provide sports analysis insisted Sunday that athletes should be able to play regardless of injuries attained through physical action. "The second they get nicked up they want to spend the game sitting on the bench drinking Gatorade," said the man, who "tweaked" his knee last week when he stood up for a moment during a commercial break. "It's pathetic how pampered and soft these athletes today are. Hold on, just adjusting my cushion here for a second." The man, who said during the broadcast that playing through pain is what separates the men from the boys, reportedly had a terrible night's sleep in his hotel suite because the silk pillowcase felt too smooth on his face.

ESPN Courts Female Viewers With 'World's Emotionally Strongest Man Competition'
BRISTOL, CT — Sports broadcasting giant ESPN, whose programming has long been a staple among male television viewers of all ages, made its first foray into women's sports programming with the introduction of the World's Emotionally Strongest Man Competition Monday. The hour-long weekly show, which will run opposite ABC's Monday Night Football, features an international cast of powerfully caring, emotionally resilient, deeply sensitive men pushing themselves and each other to the limit with astounding feats of inner strength in domestic settings around the country. During the show's premiere, a two-hour special titled "Manhattan Blowout," competitors put their bodies, minds, and spirits to the test in events ranging from the brutal grind of "Enduring Quietly As She Takes Her Hard Day At Work Out On You," to the agility-straining "Throwing A Last-Minute Surprise Party For A Despised Mother-In-Law," to the ultimate combination of strength and finesse, "Helping Her Over The Death Of The Cat That Always Hated You." "We've always been interested in expanding our brand to involve fans of every possible stripe," said ESPN president George Bodenheimer at the gala WESMC premiere party at the ESPN Zone restaurant in Times Square Monday. "When we looked at our viewers, it was immediately apparent that — figure skating, cheerleading, and gymnastics aside — women were the largest single group we were missing. This new show was designed from the ground up to give them the kind of deep, meaningful competitive experience they don't get from normal sports-entertainment shows. Over 13 million viewers tuned in for the premiere, which saw Manhattan photographer Barry Peters pull to a strong early lead in overall points with his artful, complaint-free performance in the "Synchronized Cooking And Consolation" event, during which Peters prepared a near-flawless zucchini-pepper ratatouille while effortlessly lifting the spirits of his partner, the challenging and highly unpredictable Christy Ericsson, by convincing her that she was in fact better off without that long-anticipated promotion. Other strong overall performances were turned in by Martin "There, There" Richards, a graphic designer who remembered to make his wife's beloved tapioca pudding on the anniversary — not of their marriage — but of their first date; Garth "The Embrace" Josephsen, who maintained some form of reassuring but undemanding physical contact with his fiancée for nine consecutive hours; and Ben "Soulmate" Siegel, who made his girlfriend laugh despite her belief that minor weight gain and childlessness were ruining her life. "It was perfect, honestly," said tear-prone football coach and WESMC host Dick Vermeil, who taped the show's 13 episodes earlier this summer so that he would be free to lead the Kansas City Chiefs without any heart-rending distractions. "We couldn't have asked for a better debut. Even the guys who didn't do as well as they wanted did their honest best, and we had no breakups or severely hurt feelings, despite some relatively large missteps. According to Vermeil, one competitor, Patrick "Gusher" Johnson, overcorrected a brief moment of thoughtlessness with a hasty and inappropriate marriage proposal, straining his trust almost to the breaking point. He also noted that "Magnanimous" Ver Magnusson, the lone Icelandic entrant, may have tripped himself up with his longtime companion Marta by compensating for his terse nature with an "almost creepy" overabundance of expensive gifts. Early reviews of the show have been overwhelmingly positive, with the target audience responding precisely as ESPN had hoped. "WESMC is exactly the kind of thing I've always wanted in a competitive event," said viewer Emma Michaels, who posted her approval on the show's web site. "The way these talented emotional athletes can be so strong for others, bearing up under the crushing weight of sadness, shouldering the burdens of a fully mature relationship, never taking the cop-out of 'letting a woman down easy,' and never cheating… This is the way these games are meant to be played.

New Pain-Inducing Advil Created For People Who Just Want To Feel Something, Anything
PHILADELPHIA — Wyeth Pharmaceuticals unveiled a new pain-causing line of Advil this week that will help millions of benumbed, hollow consumers to feel at least somewhat alive for up to four hours. "Advil Release delivers a soothing burst of pain when cold and listless Americans need it most," Wyeth CEO Bernard J. Poussot said during a press conference Monday. "Just two capsules can deliver all-day relief in the form of searing, life-affirming agony; the kind of agony Advil users trust when being a pale specter of humanity adrift in a meaningless and uncaring universe is just not an option anymore. According to Poussot, the new drug works by delivering a powerful stimulant straight to the brain's pain center, causing an intense stinging sensation all over the body. If taken regularly, the deadening futility of day-to-day life will be temporarily washed away in a flood of blessed and cleansing torment. "Two fast-acting, long-lasting Advil Release taken three times a day are recommended for anyone who is convinced he or she will never laugh or cry again," Poussot said. "Teenagers who see no difference between being dead or alive, nor why it makes a difference either way, may require twice the suggested dosage. Continued Poussot, "Those wishing to never again suffer through another numb, flat day devoid of even the basic components of humanness are advised to take an entire bottle of Advil Release along with a quart of gin. A nationwide advertising campaign for the new medication is slated to begin next week. In the first of two 30-second TV spots, a woman is shown walking outside on a winter's day and coming upon a puppy that has frozen to death. As she stares unblinkingly at the small, frail carcass, a disembodied announcer tells viewers: "Don't spend another day unable to shed a single tear for the eternal tragedy that is existence. Embrace the pain. Advil pain. It's the only thing that's real. Public reaction to the new medication has been generally positive. Millions of emotionally dulled people across the nation have scrambled for the opportunity, any opportunity, to temporarily escape from mechanically lurching through unfeeling day after unfeeling day after unfeeling day after unfeeling day. "This new Advil has really — oh, God, the sublime suffering," said 27-year-old copy center employee Nathan Tillson of Roanoke, VA, tears welling up in his eyes. "Sweet Jesus, I haven't closed off. I can still feel. "Gah," Tillson added before doubling over on the floor and openly sobbing for the first time in as long as he could remember. Other pharmaceutical companies have also begun marketing their own brands of over- the-counter medications that will help the emotionally anesthetized feel briefly alive. The makers of NyQuil are reportedly developing a new product they describe as "the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, aching, screaming, crying, writhing, so you can possibly — for the love of God — experience some sense of normalcy medicine," and Johnson & Johnson recently released a new line of Tylenol Maximum Suffering, the active ingredient of which is thumbtacks.

Nation's Slicked-Back-Hair Men Rally Against Negative Hollywood Portrayal
LOS ANGELES — Thousands of members of the slicked-back-hair community gathered in Hollywood Monday to protest the film industry's longtime trend of depicting men with slicked-back hair as untrustworthy, unlikeable antagonists. "There have been 4,192 films in the past 10 years in which male characters with sleek or slicked-back hairstyles have been portrayed in a negative light," said Ray Swartz, chairman of the National Organization of Men with Slicked-Back Hair. "Even though men with this hairstyle comprise just 3 percent of the U.S. populace, they make up nearly 80 percent of all film and TV villains, bad guys, and just plain assholes. As a result, thousands of men who enjoy wetting their hair and then combing it straight back face a silent but pervasive form of discrimination every single day. "I'm just a man with slicked-back hair," Swartz added. "Does that make me a sleazeball? According to statistics released by the organization, five out of every six characters with slicked-back hair are cast as the primary antagonist. Of this group, 29 percent are depicted as greedy and manipulative Wall Street sharks, 22 percent as cold, emotionless murderers, 19 percent as evil coaches or mentors, 12 percent as corrupt mafiosi, 8 percent as undead creatures who feast on human blood, and the remaining 10 percent fall into the general category of jerks/pricks/John Travolta. More alarming, Swartz said, is that certain subsets of slicked-back-hair Americans endure even worse prejudices. He cited men with slicked-back hair who also talk with cigarettes dangling out of their mouths, wear blue button-down shirts with white collars, or place toothpicks behind their right ears as the most victimized. "Just because I have heavily gelled, jet-black, slicked-back hair does not mean I can't lead a normal, productive life," Kettering, OH native Martin Sutulovich said. "I'm not consumed by an insatiable thirst for power, I know nothing about the high-pressure world of real-estate speculation, and I have a wife and kids whom I love very much. The last thing I want to do is murder them, cut them up into tiny pieces, bag them up, and put them out with the trash, but when strangers look at me, that's all they think. A recent study conducted by Swartz's group indicates that Americans who slick back their hair usually experience typical development, have life spans equal to those without slicked-back hair, and are no more likely to stoically torture people with medical instruments than the average dry-haired citizen. "You always see crooked lawyers and politicians with slicked-back hair in the movies, but when was the last time you saw a computer programmer with slicked-back hair, a farmer who built a magical baseball field in a cornfield with slicked-back hair, or a man who defused a bomb at the last possible second to save thousands of innocent lives with slicked-back hair? " Swartz said. "Never." "The closest thing we've ever gotten to a hero is Steven Seagal or that Spanish neighbor guy on Sanford And Son," he added. "And Seagal's hair is pulled back into a ponytail, so he doesn't even really count. Swartz also pointed out that even females who appear in films with slicked-back hair often end up transforming into aliens who have sex with people and then kill them. "I have naturally oily hair. If I leave it dry, it ends up messy by the end of the day, so I slick it back," Doug Roessner of Brockton, MA said. "I sell insurance for a living, so how am I supposed to get my clients to trust me when they all think I'm some money-hungry scumbag? And every time I tell my bosses that I'll 'take care of' a problem, they immediately assume I mean murdering someone. It's pathetic.

Half Of 26-Year-Old's Memories Nintendo-Related
BROOKLYN, NY — Nearly 50 percent of 26-year-old paralegal Philip Jenkins' encoded long-term memories involve button combinations, game-playing experiences, and spatial-cognitive maps of various levels and worlds from Nintendo's line of video-game consoles, a team of neuroscientists reported Tuesday. The memory-evaluation study, headed by Dr. Franklin McCarroll of New York University's School of Psychology, revealed that approximately 47 percent of Jenkins' hippocampus is dedicated to storing notable video-game victories and frustrating last-minute defeats, while 32 percent of his amygdala contains embedded neurological scripts pertaining to game strategies, character back stories, theme songs, and cheat codes. In addition, his entire dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is devoted to remembering the time he did a helicopter dunk from half-court with Shawn Kemp at the buzzer to beat the Charlotte Hornets 82-81 in NBA Jam: Tournament Edition. Although these percentages are only slightly above the average for males in Jenkins' age bracket, McCarroll said that the memories most closely associated with the interactive gaming systems can be accessed far more quickly than any of his memories involving school, work, or family. "It takes Mr. Jenkins 4.33 milliseconds to retrieve the memory of holding his newborn sister for the first time, but just 1.09 milliseconds to retrieve the memory of knocking Pikachu off the Sector Z platform with Donkey Kong's 'ground pound' maneuver in Super Smash Bros.," McCarroll said. "In fact, the only school-related memory he is able to review as vividly as the underwater-bomb-defusing level of Nintendo Entertainment System's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is his first day of college, which was spent playing multiplayer GoldenEye 007 with his roommates. According to an fMRI of Jenkins' brain regions during the process of memory recall, his parietal lobe registers the same amount of activity when he hears the word "mother" as it does when he hears the words "Banjo Kazooie." "Due to sheer repetition in his peak synaptic years for processing new information, every neural strand in Philip's basal ganglia is embedded with the Konami Code: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, select, start," McCarroll said. Nintendo-based memories are also among Jenkins' most frequently retrieved, researcher Dr. Francis Holbrook said. A series of recent tests suggest that when Jenkins accesses stored information in response to visual or mental cues, he is most likely to remember his family's trip to Disney World, followed by the time he beat the dreaded Stage 57 on Bubble Bobble without losing a life, the first time he rode a bike, the exact route he made Bo Jackson run to defeat his friend Jason Whitner at Tecmo Bowl, hiding underneath his covers while his parents fought noisily in the adjoining room, and the locations of the three warp whistles in Super Mario Bros. 3. "On Friday, we showed Mr. Jenkins a series of images meant to elicit memories of times of great pain and confusion in his life," Holbrook said. "The first two events that came to the fore of his psyche were an incident in late 2000 when the screen froze just as he was about to set a new 'best lap' record on Wave Race 64, and his great-grandmother's funeral. Holbrook also suggested that as much as 17 percent of Jenkins' cerebellum capacity may be filled with motor-coordination skills of the various Nintendo system controllers, including the Power Glove, the Power Pad mat, and the special joystick issued by Capcom for the Super NES edition of Street Fighter II. Some researchers have theorized that the amount of space Jenkins' brain allocates for Nintendo-based memories has resulted in damage to or the complete loss of his non-Nintendo-based memories. They note that although Jenkins cannot remember his father's cell phone number (415-547-6823) off the top of his head, he can recite without hesitation the password that allows you to view the credits in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! (106-113-0120). In a parallel study, a team of Columbia University behavioral psychologists suggested that Nintendo-related feats and accomplishments also account for approximately 75 percent of Jenkins' self-esteem. "Unsurprisingly, Mr. Jenkins' self-perception draws from the most important moments in his life, and is framed largely by the time he hit a game-winning grand slam with Saul in NES's Little League Baseball to help the New York team win the tournament," Dr. Gary Nordstrom said. "It is not uncommon for men his age to measure themselves by their greatest athletic achievements, and this is without a doubt Mr. Jenkins'." The findings also revealed that about 60 percent of Jenkins' repressed memories may involve Nintendo. In a Rorschach inkblot test administered to him, Jenkins compared a series of amorphous shapes to a bird eating its young, his mother brandishing a broadsword, and the entire cast of characters from Castlevania II: Simon's Quest.

Area Man Just Wants To Throw One Good Punch In His Life
SACRAMENTO, CA — Claiming that it is "something every man deserves to do once," local resident Carl Hilland, 32, told reporters Monday that, before he dies, he would like to throw a good, clean punch to somebody's face. "I want to make a guy's head snap back like in the movies," Hilland said. "All I want is the satisfaction of knowing that at one point in my life, I threw a straight right hand with complete balance and didn't look foolish doing it, and in a situation where my actions were completely justified. "Pow," he added, punching the air. "I honestly don't think that's too much to ask. Hilland, who is right-handed, characterized the ideal punch as "quick and clean," adding that he has no interest in throwing a "crazy" punch, such as an uppercut or a left hook. The husband and father of three also insisted that he is realistic in his expectations for the punch, and does not want to cause permanent damage or knock the victim out immediately. All he wants, Hillard said, is to throw the punch at an age when he will at least be able to "stun the guy a little. "This isn't about cowardice, hysteria, or blind rage," Hilland said. "It's about me, as a man, getting the chance to act like a man for once in my life. Hilland, who works as a group benefits consultant and characterizes himself as "pretty reserved," said that the approximately five punches he has thrown through the years don't count because of their nonviolent nature and social context. In each case, he was either hitting a friend in response to seeing a car with a burnt-out headlight or testing how much force he could generate with only a two-inch windup. "I did punch a wall once," said Hilland, who admitted that he took little satisfaction in it. "First off, I was just trying to make a scene, and everyone knew it. And secondly, a little scuff mark isn't the same as seeing blood stream out of a guy's nose, which is what I think will happen if I really get all my weight behind it. Added Hilland, attempting another air swing: "Boom." Hilland said the primary obstacle he faces is that he is seldom, if ever, in a position to punch anyone. He has not been in an angry physical altercation since the fourth grade, and even during those years was impeded by an unspoken "no-face" rule during fights. As a result, almost all schoolyard clashes consisted of one contestant wrestling the other to the ground while administering a headlock. "There was some whaling on people's backs, but it was all pretty sloppy," he said. "And besides, a punch isn't really a punch unless you hit a person, then immediately shake your hand because the impact was surprisingly painful. Right?" The best-case scenario, which Hilland outlined at length, would include throwing the defining blow while defending his wife when "lots of people are watching. " However, in order to carry the necessary psychological weight, the situation "has to happen organically," Hilland said. "I'm just going to go on with my day-to-day routine and be patient," Hilland added, though sources at his workplace noted that lately he seems to be escalating verbal disputes rather than defusing them. "I would even settle for hitting someone in the stomach, but it would have to be one of those body shots where they fall to the ground after gasping for air for a few seconds. "No, forget that," he continued. "It has to be to the face.

Man Gets Life In Order For 36 Minutes
JACKSONVILLE, FL — Briefly overcoming a near-continuous streak of disorganization, area man Terry Oberlin, 37, got his life together for exactly 36 minutes, sources confirmed Monday. According to family reports, Oberlin's bills for the month were paid, the living room was vacuumed, the dishes from dinner were all washed and put away, and the father of two was sitting in his favorite chair in the living room without a single thing in his life out of place. "It was nice to get some chores out of the way," Oberlin told reporters later, acknowledging that for more than half an hour he experienced no regrets, despair, or frustration of any kind. "Felt really good. The crucial worry-free period reportedly began at 7:50 p.m., when Oberlin took the garbage out to the curb and then returned to the house, where his back, which had been bothering him all day, finally cracked back into alignment. Upon entering his kitchen, he spotted a month-old magazine sitting on the counter where it didn't belong, and dropped it into the garbage. At that precise moment, sources said, Oberlin achieved a state of total order in his life. Witnesses indicated that upon entering into his relaxed state, Oberlin — who had no e-mails to respond to and was finally caught up with everything at the office — spent a full 90 seconds staring quietly at nothing in particular, and then approximately 8.5 minutes paging leisurely through the evening newspaper. During this period, he did not once concern himself with his finances, his in-laws, or his dental coverage. And as his mind began to wander freely, he neither relived painful humiliations from his past, nor felt any anxiety about his personal shortcomings. "He really seemed to be taking it easy," said wife Kay Oberlin, noting the pronounced absence of a deep furrow from her husband's brow. "He had his feet up on the ottoman. She added that on Sunday her husband seemed greatly pleased to have found the time to change the oil in his car and mow the lawn, and that during dinner Monday evening he appeared relieved upon hearing the news that the wine stain on his good white shirt had come out in the laundry. Oberlin spent the remainder of his temporary period of tranquility watching the first 26 minutes of House M.D. Monday's incident marks the first time the 37-year-old has had his life in order in more than six years. In 2003, he experienced a moment of complete inner peace that spanned a brief minute and 15 seconds, lasting from the time Oberlin finally got around to removing the training wheels from his son Tyler's bicycle to the time the boy rode it off a curb, requiring a trip to the hospital for a few stitches. "Luckily our insurance covered most of that," said Oberlin, recalling the accident and how it made him realize that, even though he had a decent health plan, his policy wasn't going to cover the cost of his children's orthodontic needs, and that if he wanted to send them to college he really needed to find a way to start contributing to their 529 funds while still keeping up with his mortgage. "And fixing the bike only took the better part of a Saturday." Household sources reported that Monday's 36 minutes of perfect order came to an end when the phone rang and Oberlin picked up the extension in his living room. It was his mother-in-law, calling to say their family vacation plans would have to be changed, since her best friend Gwyneth had just been hospitalized. "So then I had to deal with that," Oberlin said. "Which was fine, I'm not complaining. I expect I can catch the rest of that episode of House on a rerun sometime.

Guys' Night Out To Include Several Key Non-Guys
COLUMBUS, OH — Though buddies Jim Foglia, Chuck Harvestine, and Russell Vento insisted that Thursday will be a "guys night out," certain key non-guys are likely to be in attendance, sources reported Tuesday. "Honey, we're just going to be drinking beer and talking about the Reds — nothing you'd be interested in," Foglia told his wife Emily, withholding information regarding specific plans to begin the night buying drinks for college girls at the Varsity Club. "Maybe we'll stop for burgers afterward, I don't know. " Based on previous "guys' nights," the trio will more likely end the night in the company of non-male lap dancers at the Vroom Vroom Room.

Grandma Concerned About Dinner Roll Count
ROCKFORD, IL — Local grandmother Eileen Stafford, 78, expressed concern Monday over the number of dinner rolls she should have on hand for this year's Thanksgiving meal, appearing distressed when discussing the implications of there being either too many or possibly too few. On a recent trip to the supermarket, Stafford reportedly purchased a package of 12 enriched white dinner rolls that was on sale for $1.89, and has since remained torn over whether a second package is necessary. "They're a little small, and I don't want anyone to go hungry," said Stafford, carefully removing the rolls from the grocery bag to examine them more closely. "Of course, I can always give mine away if there's someone who doesn't get enough." Added Stafford, "I don't have to have any rolls." The elderly grandmother of four told reporters that, while she would hate for anything to go to waste, she would be equally upset if one of her guests reached into her wicker basket and found nothing but crumbs. "Bill usually has two, even though he really shouldn't," said Stafford, referring to her son-in-law, whose above-average appetite she must always take into consideration when planning family meals. "And [daughter] Sheila's on that diet where they don't eat any bread." Despite her insistence that she really doesn't want to bother anyone about anything, Stafford admitted that in the past week she has contacted several family members on multiple occasions to get an idea of how much company might be coming over. Pacing nervously in her kitchen, the small septuagenarian admitted that, even if she were to acquire an accurate estimate of those planning to attend, the number still could increase or decrease dramatically without any notice. "Sandy doesn't make it home for holidays much since the divorce, but you never know," Stafford said of her youngest son. "And [grandson] Dennis sometimes gets called into work at the last minute, because he is a very good doctor and people trust him and rely on him. Still, it would be a real shame if that happened five Thanksgivings in a row." As a precautionary measure, Stafford has made several trips to nearby grocery stores to ensure that suitable dinner rolls are still available should a need for them arise in the coming days. If an emergency leaves her with no time to purchase an additional package, Stafford said she is prepared to defrost the hot dog buns in her freezer, a surplus from her upsetting overestimate of the turnout for this year's Memorial Day picnic. According to a longtime friend who spoke with Stafford at church Sunday morning, the grandmother became flustered when discussing the possibility of someone bringing a girlfriend or boyfriend unannounced. Stafford, who lives alone in the house where she and her late husband raised their children, also said that she fears failure to serve her guests an appropriate amount of food might result in family members deciding to host next year's Thanksgiving festivities at one of their own homes instead. "Grandma gets so worked up about the littlest stuff," said Amy Joyner, Stafford's granddaughter. "She's been calling me a couple times a day to update me on her dinner preparations and ask if I know about a better sale on sweet potatoes near us." Joyner said since her grandfather Walter Stafford passed away in 2005, the holidays have made her grandmother uneasy because she worries that no one will be able to carve the turkey into "nice-sized" pieces the way Grandpa used to. "It's always, 'Oh, no, that's not how Walter used to carve it — you should really carve it thicker, like your father would,'" said eldest son Michael Stafford, who has taken over many of the patriarchal duties in recent years. "It's just a turkey, for Christ's sake, and Dad isn't the one carving it anymore. I am. I'm the one carving the damn turkey now." In addition to her roll-related anxieties, family sources reported that Stafford still has not decided whether to serve frozen or canned corn.

Deterioration Of Bauhaus T-Shirt Symbolizes End Of Era For Local Man
SOUTHFIELD, MI — Sadness, loss and the dull ache of acceptance were just some of the feelings experienced by 29-year-old suburban homeowner and father-to-be Jeff Struck Monday after unearthing a deteriorated Bauhaus T-shirt from his fondly remembered college days. "You can barely read the part on the back where it says 'Bela Lugosi's Dead' any more," said Struck, who came across the shirt in a box marked "Rags/Goodwill" while looking for something old to wear to paint the garage. "This is like the end of an era for me. "Sure did have a lot of good times in that shirt," said Struck, slowly turning the faded garment over in his hands. Struck, who attended the University of Michigan from 1987 to 1991, was introduced to Bauhaus in October 1987, when friend and roommate Scott "Scooter" Rothenberger rented the movie The Hunger, which featured a Bauhaus song over the opening credits. The following day, Struck purchased two of the British proto-Goth band's albums, Terror Couple Kill Colonel and Bauhaus 1979-1983, as well as the T-shirt. "Look, there's the rip on the sleeve Crazy Mike made that time we were carrying him home and he was so drunk he kept slipping on the sidewalk," said Struck, sitting in the breakfast nook of his new starter home. "And that rusty stain where I left it on Scooter's bike handlebars for a couple of days after going skinny-dipping in the river. Good times, man, good times. Among other fond memories dredged up by the shirt: the time he wore it for four days straight during an unplanned, last-minute trip to Mardi Gras; the time he wore it in 1988 when he and a co-worker stumbled across a free concert in the Michigan Union by "this incredible band that turned out to be Jane's Addiction"; and the time he wore it dancing, then got drunk, went home with a woman whose name he never learned, and had the best sex of his life. "I'm really glad I found the shirt," Struck said. "But I can't for the life of me remember what happened to my Bauhaus albums. I think we may have sold them at that garage sale we held to pay for the bedroom set. Oh, well. Deciding he didn't want to get paint on the T-shirt, Struck put it over his shoulder and returned to the basement, rummaging in the box for an alternate shirt. He eventually settled on a yellow Meyer's Rum Sharkbite! shirt he received for free while working as a bartender at The Gold Mine, a popular student night spot that is now a laundromat.

Area Man Just Wants Regular Haircut Without All The Frou-Frou
GLENDALE, AZ–Retired building contractor Bud Easler, 67, who ordinarily patronizes Vic's Barbershop, informed Studio Quest hairstylist Gina Nardo Sunday that he just wants "a regular haircut, without all the frou-frou." "The wife dragged me along on one of her all-day shopping expeditions, and right next to her shoe store was this hair place. I knew Mary would be looking at shoes for a long time, and I was due for a little trim, so I figured what the hey," Easler said. "Big mistake. "The second I walked in the door, I knew it was trying to be one of those frilly-dilly places," Easler said of Studio Quest, which bills itself as "a European-style salon and day spa with professional services at affordable prices. " "I sat down in the chair, and right off the bat, this Gina gal was all deep-cleansing-conditioner this, collagen-shampoo that. I just wanted my hair a few inches shorter, and that's it. The frou-frou started before Easler had even reached Nardo's chair. Upon telling receptionist Kirsten Mills that he wanted a haircut, Easler was asked if he would like a manicure or body treatment, as well. "I sure as heck don't look like no lady, so I don't know why she was asking me about a manicure," Easler said. "And as far as a 'body treatment' goes, I didn't know what on Earth that was, but it sure sounded funny, so I just said no without even asking what it was. Easler's refusal hardly streamlined the haircut process, however. "I usually just like to sit in a chair and maybe flip through a magazine while Vic or one of the other fellas cuts my hair," Easler said. "But this Gina gal, she had a question every step of the way. Did I want guava-essence shampoo or wildflower with extract? Would I like to see a list of microdermabrasion scalp exfoliators? Did I want vitamin E and a sea-algae moisturizing spritz? So I say to her, 'Look, if you want to maybe shave the back of my neck, that would be fine.' Before she began cutting, Nardo rubbed what Easler described as "some sort of fancy oil" into his scalp. She then put a towel over his head and left him for five minutes while the substance soaked in. "The gal just took off," Easler said. "So after a few minutes, I looked around the joint and said, 'Yoo-hoo! Where are you? I hope you didn't forget about me!' Then she came back. " When she returned, Nardo explained that she had applied a regenerative conditioning scalp treatment with warm mineral soak, which was included in the price of the haircut. She added that, from the looks of Easler's ends, he "really needed it. Throughout the session, Nardo recommended a number of skin procedures Easler should consider having done. According to the stylist, years of neglect had dried out Easler's pores, making him a prime candidate for a deep-pore cleansing facial, which includes a skin analysis, steam treatment, and enzyme masque. Easler declined the facial. Undeterred, Nardo began giving him a one-minute mini scalp massage, which "serves to reinvigorate tired follicles. " Easler quickly cut her off, insisting that he didn't have a lot of time, and that he just wanted "your basic trim. "I told her my follicles were fine and that I just needed a quick, regular, old-fashioned haircut," Easler said. "Even my wife can't shop forever.

GOP Promotes Carly Fiorina To Male Candidate After Strong Debate Showing
WASHINGTON — Saying she had proven herself to be a formidable contender worthy of respect, GOP leaders announced Thursday that Carly Fiorina had been officially promoted to a male candidate after her strong showing in last night's primary debate. "Given her steady rise in the polls and her consistent performance on the national stage, we have determined that Ms. Fiorina's skills as a speaker and compelling ideas about foreign and domestic policy merit her recognition as male," said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, adding that the former Hewlett-Packard CEO had impressed GOP officials with her breadth of knowledge, her confidence, and her ability to doggedly attack both Democrats and her primary opponents, and therefore deserved to have the label of "female" removed entirely. "We are pleased to be able to offer Ms. Fiorina the increased respect and media coverage that come with being a male candidate. Allow me to be the first to congratulate him and say that he has certainly earned it." Priebus added that the committee was still reviewing Marco Rubio's performance, but was strongly considering promoting him to white.

Al-Qaeda Claims Responsibility For Devastating Personal Attack On Illinois Man
WASHINGTON — In a statement posted this morning on several Islamist websites, the global terrorist network al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for last Thursday's devastating personal attack on Carbondale, IL resident Tim Harris. The highly coordinated strike, which targeted the unsuspecting 32-year-old as he exited a Huck's convenience store, and made light of his ample girth, lack of employment, and inability to meet single women, occurred at 9:32 a.m. At 9:35 a.m., a second wave of vicious insults was reportedly launched at Harris, obliterating what little remained of his self-esteem. "The foot soldiers of Islam have struck at this pathetic slob of a man with righteous force, and they have brought him down," read the statement, which praised as heroes the four al-Qaeda operatives who carried out the personal attack. "There is nothing left of him now. Tim Harris has been destroyed. "Praise be to Allah," the statement continued. "Allah is great. Department of Homeland Security officials told reporters that it could take months to determine the full extent of the damage from what they are calling the worst-ever ad hominem strike on American soil, even as crews worked around the clock to salvage whatever bits of Harris' self-respect they could from the wreckage. "Never before has our nation witnessed such brutal mockery," Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said. "It appears that al-Qaeda had been monitoring Mr. Harris long enough to become fully conversant in his insecurities, and was prepared to employ any means necessary, even pointing out his huge, Neanderthal-like underbite, to achieve its terrible goal. Indeed, there wasn't a single emotional sore spot — from his lack of sexual experience to the fact that most animals don't seem to like him — that they did not exploit. "It's unthinkable," Napolitano added. "They even reminded Tim about the time nobody showed up to his New Year's party. When asked by reporters why her department had failed to prevent the hurtful attack, Napolitano said it was impossible for the government to secure every potential target in a country so densely populated with losers. "At this time, we simply don't have the resources necessary for such an undertaking," Napolitano said. "As much as we would like to, we cannot guarantee the safety of every former telemarketer who sleeps on a futon and still has roommates despite being almost 35 years old. Critics, however, pointed to the fact that al-Qaeda had attempted a similar personal attack on Harris in 2003, one that might have succeeded had it not been for an uncharacteristic intelligence-gathering error on the terrorists' part. "We know that al-Qaeda will keep returning to a target until they get their desired result," CIA director Leon Panetta said. "Seven years ago, for whatever reason, they failed to take into account that Mr. Harris had been feeling pretty good about having done push-ups that morning and was optimistic about a job interview he'd just been on. That attack was unsuccessful, but we should have learned from it. "I mean, just look at the guy," Panetta added. "It's hard to imagine a more vulnerable target. While acknowledging that there is no foolproof way of protecting oneself against the cruelly incisive barbs of al-Qaeda, DHS released today a list of basic self-maintenance measures that Americans, particularly the most defenseless sad sacks, should employ to minimize their risk. Chief among these is cultivating an awareness of one's personal appearance. According to Napolitano, small, relatively easy improvements in wardrobe and hygiene can deprive al-Qaeda of obvious defects upon which to capitalize. "All Americans must be vigilant about combing their hair," Napolitano said. "Also, they should wear a shirt that fits them for once in their life, and if they choose to put on sweatpants, maybe avoid those with obvious mustard stains on them. "A personal attack can come at any time and when you least expect it, whether you're lounging around all weekend in your bathrobe or sitting in the waiting room of a hair-loss clinic," she added. Napolitano stressed that there was no immediate threat of a personal strike against any particular individual. However, she admitted that her department was closely monitoring a number of "soft targets," including recently divorced Chicago resident David Braumberg, chronically fatigued Wal-Mart cashier Bridget Carmichael, and Rich Parker, a 28-year-old Ohio native who divides his time between playing poker online and staring glassy-eyed at old high school yearbooks late at night. "I've personally monitored a few of these targets myself," Napolitano said. "Believe me, an attack from al-Qaeda is the last thing these losers need.

Universe Comes To Halt As Kid Flips Through First Shark Book
SPRINGDALE, AR — The dynamic processes by which matter and energy function in the physical world ground to a halt Thursday night as 7-year-old Troy Benton paged through his first fully illustrated book about sharks. "Whoa!" said Benton, who was staring wide-eyed at a photo of a great white shark when time came to a complete standstill, the planets stopped dead in their orbits, and a strange, unknowable force disrupted all of existence and caused a rift in the very fabric of reality. "Up to 20 rows of teeth?

Last Minute Of Man's Sexual Prime Expires During Routine Visit To Dry Cleaner
WICHITA, KS — At 8:42 p.m. Thursday, Wichita resident Cody Dixon, 29, reportedly spent the final seconds of his peak period of virility dropping off two dress shirts at Lambert's Dry Cleaners. "Can I get these by Thursday?" asked Dixon as the testosterone coursing through his veins reached a zenith he will never again know and his libido began its slow, lifelong decline. "Heavy starch would be good. Otherwise those collars won't stand up. " Though Dixon did not appear† to notice the wane of his sexual prime, he was momentarily aware of his entry into the peak back-hair-growing phase of his life.

Retro-Crazed German Youths Invade Poland
WARSAW, POLAND — In the largest nostalgia-driven military assault in history, 250,000 retro-crazed German teenagers and twentysomethings invaded Poland Monday. "The '30s were, like, the coolest decade," said 17-year-old Grete Wunsch of Dusseldorf, one of the 840 young hipsters in the 55th Panzer Division who seized control of the capital city of Warsaw and set up a provisional German government. "The clothes, the music, the rallies — that whole Third Reich thing was just the best. I was so born in the wrong decade. "Lebensraum is totally where it's at," said Günter Groff, 19, a high-ranking officer in the popular teen retro-club which calls itself "The S.S." "We're tired of the mainstream, corporate clothes and pop music of the '90s. We hunger for something more, something to call our own, and we understand that the Fatherland must gain more territory if the superior Aryan Race is to claim its rightful destiny as rulers of the Untermensch." Throughout Poland, the air is filled with the exuberant sounds of traditional Bavarian "oom-pah" bands, the synchronized stomp of marching jackboots, and rousing songs of patriotic fervor, as German retro-fever takes the nation by force. The trendy German youths are getting Polish citizens into the act, too, issuing them passes, demanding to see papers, and strictly enforcing curfews on pain of execution by firing squad. Despite the protests of the conquered Poles, who insist that the German retro craze is "played out," the trend shows no sign of waning any time soon. In fact, it seems to be gaining momentum, poised to sweep across all of Europe. "The '90s are so boring. There are never any world wars anymore. That's why this retro thing is so awesome–it's finally our chance to do some of that cool stuff we missed," said Birgid Schumacher, 16, of Berlin. "I am so psyched to annex Czechoslovakia." "Things go in cycles, ja? " said 17-year-old Otto Meine of Stuttgart, a German Youth Brigade junior officer stationed in Gdansk. "Last year, the big thing with all the kids at school was The Spice Girls, but this year it's the violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Next year, who knows? It could be the construction of massive, industrial deathcamps and the wholesale conversion of the native Jewry into soap. There's just so much great old stuff to bring back. Meine's exuberant attitude seems to be contagious. Across Germany, young people are jumping on the retro bandwagon, wearing vintage brownshirt uniforms and attending massive "old-school" military rallies that draw hundreds of thousands to city squares. The biggest event of the retro movement, observers say, will likely come this summer, when two million youths are expected to flock to the French border for a star-studded, three-day festival. Tentatively titled "The Claiming Of Alsace-Lorraine," the festival will feature rock bands, extreme-sports competitions, and the brutal occupation of the long-disputed French border region by Germany. Organizers are so confident the festival will be a success, plans are already underway for a follow-up event for next summer: London Blitzkrieg '99. Despite the sudden and extreme nature of the current wave of retro fever, its young devotees insist that their love of the '30s and '40s isn't just a pose. It is, they say, a way of life. "It's about finding real meaning, real truth, in your heritage, your nation and your race," said Berliner Klaus Hofbreit, 18. "This isn't just about the clothes I put on, or the music I listen to while marching across neighboring countries' borders. It's about finding strength in who you are and triumphing through sheer will. It's about my kultur, know what I'm saying? The totenkultur. Added Hofbreit: "Deutschland über alles, baby!

Man Who Enjoys Thing Informed He Is Wrong
LOS ANGELES — George Himmelsbaugh, 32, was informed Tuesday that he was incorrect in enjoying a thing he had been deriving pleasure from for many years. Authorities in the field informed Himmelsbaugh that, although he believes his appreciation of the thing to be a matter of subjective personal taste, any positive feelings or satisfaction taken from this are by definition erroneous. Furthermore, sources reported, Himmelsbaugh does not in fact enjoy the thing, but has merely been convinced that he does by the influence of others who also claim to enjoy the thing but who must be insane or developmentally disabled if they actually do. Himmelsbaugh has responded to the information by endeavoring to enjoy the correct things in the future.

Local Asshole Attains World-Class Status
MADISON, PA — Local asshole Skyler Berwin, 28, was granted world-class asshole status Saturday during a special ceremony held in recognition of detestable actions that were deemed beyond the pale even for a major-league asshole such as himself. "Due to Mr. Berwin's consistent refusal to pay for drinks, his tendency to loudly point the flaws of others, and his habit of turning up at your place unannounced to eat whatever's in the fridge and then crash for a couple days, the board votes unanimously in this matter," said National North American Asshole Council chairman Tucker Max, citing sworn affidavits testifying that Skyler had been "a career asshole as far back as college. " "I hereby declare Skyler Berwin to be a 24-karat, world-class asshole, with all the rights and responsibilities pertaining to that office. " Following his certification, Berwin refused to apologize for his actions, claiming that that was just the kind of asshole he is.

Autistic Child Ruins Marriage He Was Born To Save
HOUSTON — With the challenges accompanying his developmental disorder widening the already vast gulf between his parents, autistic child Evan Thomas, 3, continued this week to destroy the failing marriage he was brought into this world to save. Evan, who through the very act of being born was entrusted with the task of resolving lingering conflicts, soothing deep-seated contempt, and restoring intimacy to Mark and Sharon Thomas' long-strained relationship, has thus far utterly failed in his assigned duties, sources reported Monday. "It's so much work taking care of Evan, and Mark just refuses to help out as much as he should," said Sharon Thomas, who endured a long, agonizing childbirth to put an end to the couple's constant bitter arguments. "It's so frustrating. I don't get any time to myself because Evan needs attention like 24 hours a day. "I never asked for this," Sharon added According to sources, Mark Thomas, 32, had always wanted a healthy, happy, completely normal son to provide a quick and easy fix to all of his marital problems. However, rather than allaying their trust issues and instantly making everything all better, Evan has reportedly driven a deeper rift between his parents by prompting fights about who is to blame for his condition. "The doctors are constantly telling us that it's not anyone's fault, but if you'd ever met Sharon's brothers, you'd know that something's not quite right on that side of the family," Mark said. "We probably shouldn't yell in front of him as much as we do, but he doesn't really pay much attention and it honestly doesn't seem to bother him. "In fact, nothing seems to bother him," Mark continued. Although Evan was only diagnosed with autism six months ago, Mark said it was clear right after bringing him home from the hospital that something was wrong with their son, since their lives did not take a dramatic 180-degree turn for the better, lingering disputes did not just melt away, and years of underlying tension were only brought into sharper focus. The child, who according to his parents rarely smiles or acts cheerful, has left many in the household concerned that he's not committed to mending the broken relationship. Moreover, during the past three years, Evan has reportedly done almost nothing to curb Mark's controlling nature or Sharon's cruel emotional abuse. Evan has also failed to utter the words "mama" or "dada," thereby ruining any chance his parents might have had at forging an instantaneous, all-healing bond. "Nobody told me I'd be so exhausted and cranky all the time," said Mark, who had anticipated that a son would create the mutual respect that his marriage has always lacked as opposed to making him feel overwhelmed and trapped. "Now, I just get nagged about never dealing with Evan after I bust my ass at work all day. Mark and Sharon also complained that the highly structured schedule they're forced to keep to prevent Evan from "acting up" has severely strained their social life, causing them to miss a recent Super Bowl party at a neighbor's house that all of their friends without special-needs children were at. In 2006, before giving birth to Evan, the awful couple attempted to salvage their relationship by purchasing an American pit bull terrier puppy. But the dog, who was reportedly a real pain to take care of, lacked the discipline to put in any work on their miserable marriage and always demanded too much affection. Family members told reporters they weren't surprised Evan has not yet managed to transform the couple's dysfunctional marriage into a healthy and loving one. "Oh God, they should never have had a kid," Evan's grandmother Janet Harmon said. "She should have gotten her tubes tied like she threatened to do in the first place. Mark and Sharon said they were currently trying to get pregnant again in hopes that a new baby would take off some of the pressure of raising Evan all alone.

Man Gets Life In Order For 36 Minutes
JACKSONVILLE, FL — Briefly overcoming a near-continuous streak of disorganization, area man Terry Oberlin, 37, got his life together for exactly 36 minutes, sources confirmed Monday. According to family reports, Oberlin's bills for the month were paid, the living room was vacuumed, the dishes from dinner were all washed and put away, and the father of two was sitting in his favorite chair in the living room without a single thing in his life out of place. "It was nice to get some chores out of the way," Oberlin told reporters later, acknowledging that for more than half an hour he experienced no regrets, despair, or frustration of any kind. "Felt really good. The crucial worry-free period reportedly began at 7:50 p.m., when Oberlin took the garbage out to the curb and then returned to the house, where his back, which had been bothering him all day, finally cracked back into alignment. Upon entering his kitchen, he spotted a month-old magazine sitting on the counter where it didn't belong, and dropped it into the garbage. At that precise moment, sources said, Oberlin achieved a state of total order in his life. Witnesses indicated that upon entering into his relaxed state, Oberlin — who had no e-mails to respond to and was finally caught up with everything at the office — spent a full 90 seconds staring quietly at nothing in particular, and then approximately 8.5 minutes paging leisurely through the evening newspaper. During this period, he did not once concern himself with his finances, his in-laws, or his dental coverage. And as his mind began to wander freely, he neither relived painful humiliations from his past, nor felt any anxiety about his personal shortcomings. "He really seemed to be taking it easy," said wife Kay Oberlin, noting the pronounced absence of a deep furrow from her husband's brow. "He had his feet up on the ottoman. She added that on Sunday her husband seemed greatly pleased to have found the time to change the oil in his car and mow the lawn, and that during dinner Monday evening he appeared relieved upon hearing the news that the wine stain on his good white shirt had come out in the laundry. Oberlin spent the remainder of his temporary period of tranquility watching the first 26 minutes of House M.D. Monday's incident marks the first time the 37-year-old has had his life in order in more than six years. In 2003, he experienced a moment of complete inner peace that spanned a brief minute and 15 seconds, lasting from the time Oberlin finally got around to removing the training wheels from his son Tyler's bicycle to the time the boy rode it off a curb, requiring a trip to the hospital for a few stitches. "Luckily our insurance covered most of that," said Oberlin, recalling the accident and how it made him realize that, even though he had a decent health plan, his policy wasn't going to cover the cost of his children's orthodontic needs, and that if he wanted to send them to college he really needed to find a way to start contributing to their 529 funds while still keeping up with his mortgage. "And fixing the bike only took the better part of a Saturday." Household sources reported that Monday's 36 minutes of perfect order came to an end when the phone rang and Oberlin picked up the extension in his living room. It was his mother-in-law, calling to say their family vacation plans would have to be changed, since her best friend Gwyneth had just been hospitalized. "So then I had to deal with that," Oberlin said. "Which was fine, I'm not complaining. I expect I can catch the rest of that episode of House on a rerun sometime.

Cat Refuses To Die
SOMERVILLE, MA — Despite his advanced age, near-complete physical decay, and constant bouts of renal failure, area cat Socrates vehemently refuses to die, sources reported Tuesday. "He's a sweet old guy, and he's been through a lot," said Brian Pressman, 33, who received the cat as a birthday present during middle school. "But no matter how weak he seems or how many times he's diagnosed with something fatal, he just keeps bouncing back. Every single time. Added Pressman, with a sigh, "He sure is a persistent one. In the past week alone, Pressman has taken Socrates to visit the veterinarian three times, missing a half day of work on Monday to treat the stubborn cat for a nagging eye infection. Once there, however, the veterinarian discovered that Socrates had developed ulcers and would require special medication that will likely lengthen the 19-year-old feline's life for another unknown period of time. The seemingly indestructible Socrates is currently on five separate prescriptions at a monthly cost of $224. "We came to peace with the fact that Socrates might pass away when we found that tumor on his head last Christmas," said wife Emily Pressman, 31, whose 2-year-old son David has thus far been unable to kill the cat despite his playful but relentless physical abuse. "And then again in April when he fell off the table and hurt his leg. Frankly, I figured it would only be a matter of time after that, but he's still here. Still kicking. "We never could have imagined that he'd live this long," she added. "Not in a million years. Socrates, who apparently rejects the very concept of mortality, sleeps an estimated 20 hours a day and hasn't had a solid bowel movement in more than a year, Pressman told reporters. Moreover, the cat requires a twice-daily subcutaneous saline and electrolyte injection to manage the severe kidney problems that began three years ago. The couple takes turns completing this humiliating, time-consuming task, and must also perform the animal's morning feeding ritual — which requires a special food for older cats to be ground up and watered down so Socrates' feeble teeth and digestive tracts can better handle it. "Just like clockwork, Socrates and I are up bright and early every morning at six when he starts howling and howling," Emily Pressman said. "Sometimes it's more like 5:30 if he's having one of his vomiting spells. Of course, that's assuming he hasn't woken us up already with those deep, mournful moans. But once I force-feed him his hyperthyroid pills and clean up the mess, he's usually pretty quiet for the rest of the day. I tend to forget he's even around. Of all the occasions in the past few years when Socrates has somehow managed to escape death's cold embrace, none was more harrowing, the Pressmans said, than the summer of 2004, when a weak and anguished Socrates was rushed to the hospital with the deadly feline virus panleukopenia. "He was in such pain that we were hoping and praying that Socrates would go to a better place," Brian Pressman said. "That was over five years ago. Luckily, the doctors figured out a treatment that only cost $2,700, and here we are today. Alive and well. Five years later. It's a miracle, all right. "I honestly don't know what I'd do without him," Pressman added. "Besides not have a cat anymore.

Spatial Skills Abandon Area Man During Search For Correct Tupperware Lid
WATERVILLE, ME — The ability to judge different sizes and shapes was inexplicably lost on Waterville resident John Wyatt on Tuesday as he struggled to find the correct lid for a plastic container of chicken salad. According to witnesses, the seemingly rational man cycled through 17 separate lids in his desperate search to find a corresponding match, rotating each incorrect cover multiple times in hopes that it would somehow fit. "Why won't this work? " asked Wyatt, who is reportedly an intelligent and astute individual most of the time. "Just close already, goddammit. " At press time, Wyatt was attempting to secure a square lid onto a round container with several sheets of plastic wrap.

Man Who Enjoys Popular Rock Songs Discovers Perfect Radio Station
ROCHESTER, NY — Sean Ridgeway, a 36-year-old carpenter who is fond of popular rock 'n' roll music from the late 1960s to the present, told reporters Monday that he has somehow discovered a radio station with a format that matches his tastes exactly. "I'm telling you, [93.2 FM] the Beast has it all," said Ridgeway, who was also amazed that much of the station's advertising seemed custom-tailored to him due to its abundant information on local establishments serving both beer and chicken wings. "The Stones, the Who, Pearl Jam, Green Day, you name it. And get this, every day at five o'clock the Z-Man plays three songs in a row by Led Zeppelin. It's called 'Get the Led Out.' I love Led Zeppelin." Though Ridgeway said that he is satisfied with the Beast's programming, he is reportedly investigating enticing claims of more rock and less talk made by a competing radio station.

Man At Bar Has Incredibly Complicated Reason For Why He Enjoys Rolling Rock
IDAHO FALLS, ID — Misinterpreting a bartender's raised eyebrow as an unspoken question, Kenny's Bar patron Neil Plottman delivered a long, convoluted explanation Wednesday as to why he ordered a Rolling Rock beer. "Well, when I was in college in Philly, me and my friend used to drink this all the time," Plottman said. "Plus there's the whole supporting-local-businesses thing, and the cool '33' on the label there, which not a lot of people know is a Masonic thing. Not a bad beer, once you get used to it. " Plottman then ruined a game of darts by explaining to the uninterested players what he would drink if Rolling Rock wasn't available and why he had to drink beer out of a mug instead of a pilsner glass.

Man At Bar Clinging To Muted 'King Of Queens' Episode Like Life Preserver
DENVER, CO — Like a desperate shipwreck survivor clutching at flotsam in the North Atlantic, area bar patron Kyle Whaley kept his eyes glued to a muted episode of the sitcom King Of Queens Monday, attempting to look as if he had some reason to be at Snooker's Bar and Grill despite not knowing anyone there. "Last I hear Bob was back at his landscaping job," a nearby bar patron said in a conversation Whaley had no hope of joining. Watching without sound or subtitles, Whaley shifted nervously on his barstool and locked his gaze on the program like a man cornered by an angry bear. As of press time, there was only one segment left after the upcoming commercial break, and Whaley's options were quickly running out.

Man Abuses Child Quietly Out Of Respect For Other Diners
FORT SMITH, AR — Hoping to avoid rudely interrupting the meals of nearly two dozen other patrons, James Larson lowered his voice while quietly scarring his 7-year-old son emotionally, sources at the Dodson Diner reported Thursday. "You shut your damn mouth," hissed Larson in the small boy's ear, while being careful not to upset those in the restaurant's dining area. "Just wait till we get you home. I swear I'll slap that stupid smirk right off your face. " Worried that he may have overstepped his bounds, Larson then repeatedly apologized to his waitress and politely excused himself and his whimpering son so that he could administer a proper chastising.

New Boyfriend Charming Pants Off Baskin-Robbins Staff
OAKWOOD, GA — After claiming he's so full from lunch he couldn't possibly eat more than a couple of sprinkles, Kevin Warner, who is on his fifth date with Stephanie Hilten, appears to be delighting the hell out of the Baskin-Robbins employees currently serving the two 17-year-olds. Warner reportedly won over the cashiers within moments of entering the store, jokingly asking whether they had any different flavors in the back, and making flattering, slightly flirtatious comments about Hilten. "Oh my God, everybody just loves him," said Hilten, who has remained arm-in-arm with her boyfriend during the entire endearing transaction. "Oh my God. I love him. " Sources close to the couple said a guy like Warner is exactly what Hilten needs, especially after what her last boyfriend did to her at Applebee's.

Man Dies After Secret 4-Year Battle With Gorilla
ROANOKE, VA — Local claims adjuster David Seaborne, a devoted husband and father of three, died Tuesday at the age of 37 following a long and painful personal battle with a 512-pound eastern lowland gorilla. According to his wife, Christine — one of the few people who was aware of his courageous struggle — Seaborne chose to fight the muscular, quarter-ton primate in private night after night in hopes of maintaining as normal a life as was possible for his family. "In some ways, I'm relieved that it's finally over and David can be at peace," said a tearful Mrs. Seaborne, clutching at a recent photograph of her husband, most of his hair missing after being ripped from his scalp by the rampaging jungle beast. "To watch him seclude himself in that basement every night and know that he was about to be in an unimaginable amount of pain — it just became too much to bear." "He fought that terrible gorilla with every last ounce of strength he had, but in the end, David's body just couldn't handle it anymore," Mrs. Seaborne added. "Every morning, he'd look at me with tired eyes and deep scratches across his face, and he'd say, 'Honey, I'm going to beat this thing.' God, he was brave." Mrs. Seaborne said she's used most of her husband's life insurance payout to start the David Seaborne Foundation, an organization dedicated to raising awareness of those battling gorillas or other great apes. According to the foundation's website, the growing problem affects one in every 29 million Americans, and one in every 80 Congolese. Although Seaborne never let on to friends or coworkers that he was desperately fighting for his life with a violent primate, many suspected that something was wrong. "I noticed that David had lost a lot of weight over the past couple of months, especially when he came in with his arm torn off," fellow claims adjuster Kevin Delano said. "He also left work early a lot for doctor's appointments, or when he was just too weak to make it through the day. Still, with all he was going through, David never complained." The few people who knew of his hardship said that, even toward the end of his ordeal, when Seaborne was often completely covered in feces, the gorilla never managed to rob him of his dignity. Dr. Earl Patterson, the physician who treated Seaborne throughout his life-or-death battle, initially gave Seaborne just six months to live. Though the prognosis was grim, Patterson said that, with the help of powerful tranquilizers, Seaborne was able to beat back the gorilla several times, and his situation started to look more promising. The gorilla, however, eventually stopped responding to the drugs and returned with a vengeance. "If we had caught this thing earlier, before its growth got completely out of control, David would have had a much better chance of survival," Patterson said. "But after it reached the silverback stage, it was only a matter of time." "I tried to make David as comfortable as possible, and even gave him a helmet, but at that point the most we could do was pray," Patterson added. Patterson said that he has strongly urged Seaborne's wife to take preventative measures to protect the couple's three sons, aged 9, 12, and 15, from suffering the same fate as their father. "Because these things tend to run in the family, Jonathan, Patrick, and David Jr. are in a very high risk group," Patterson said. "Realistically, though, there just isn't a whole lot that can be done. After all, that gorilla is still in their basement."

Man Running After Bus Delights Bus Occupants
CLEVELAND — Passengers aboard a northbound number 67 bus were reportedly filled with delight and joy Monday as they watched a fellow resident run helplessly after the rapidly departing vehicle. The endlessly uplifting and entertaining chase, which took place between 8:23 a.m. and 8:25 a.m., began shortly after the Cleveland-area bus pulled away from its Sixth Avenue stop. According to passengers, it was then that they first noticed a large unidentified man in a business suit running in complete desperation to catch up with the bus. "He was actually moving pretty fast," said Donald Schoemeyer, one of roughly a dozen passengers whose spirits were lifted by the hulking, heavily sweating man. "Even when it was clear that there was no way he was going to make it, he still kept running after us. "I guess he really needed to get on that bus," added Schoemeyer, a faint smile forming on his lips. Reports indicate that a number of factors contributed to the overall feeling of joy among those lucky enough to witness the spectacle. Among them, the fact that the man was not in very good physical shape, an indication that the act of running was in all likelihood his last recourse; the black briefcase the man was carrying at the time of his amusing chase, which not only added weight to his already cumbersome frame, but also suggested he was trying to be on time for some important business meeting; and lastly, the growing improbability that the man was ever going to reach the speeding bus. "His face was getting all sorts of red," said Cleveland resident Roberta Washington, who sat inches away from one of 15 stop-request buttons and watched the whole frantic pursuit from her seat. "You could tell he was yelling something from the way his mouth kept on moving, and the way he was waving that one arm all around. "Heh," Washington continued. "He was waving that arm pretty good. According to public transportation sources, the morning commute aboard the number 67 bus is generally unremarkable and monotonous, with commuters sitting in silence and dreading another long, hard day of work. The appearance of the running, wildly gesticulating man, however, instantly altered the mood aboard the bus, bringing with it a kind of levity and cheerfulness not experienced in weeks. "At first, I thought I was the only one who saw him, but then I turned around and there were like six other people also grinning to themselves," said Michael Schwarz, who takes the 67 every morning. "It was just this really nice moment we all got to share together. Those on the bus weren't the only ones warmed upon sight of the increasingly exhausted man. Pedestrians and motorists along Sixth Avenue were also afforded a brief moment of joy after seeing the panting man momentarily trip, spill his coffee on the sidewalk, and then look up in despair as the bus sped further and further away from him. Roughly one minute into the chase, when it appeared that the now-kneeling man had finally given up, and that no additional pleasure would be brought to the enthralled passengers, a serendipitous event took place. Witnesses at the corner of Howard Road and Davies Avenue reported that a red traffic light finally brought the speeding bus to a stop, allowing the delightful man one last opportunity to catch up. "Believe it or not, that poor bastard actually got to his feet again and started running our way," said city worker Jerome Turner, who claimed that he had been rooting for the man the entire time. "He almost made it, too. But then the light turned green and, you know how it is, I just had to keep driving.

Rude Guy Unfortunately Says Something Funny
LOWELL, MA — Coworkers having a drink Friday at the Blue Shamrock Pub reported feeling disgusted with themselves for laughing — and in some cases even cracking up — at a remark made by an obnoxious member of the group whose behavior up to that point had been worthy of scorn and dismay. "Why did that jerk have to go and say something so goddamn hilarious? " said a crestfallen Dennis Gladstone, who shook his head as he acknowledged that the comment had caused him to chuckle audibly, thereby validating the total prick. "Now that we've all laughed it up with that asshole, he'll probably want to come out drinking with us all the time. " According to reporters, Gladstone then paused, giggled to himself, and said, "Fuck me!

Area Couple Not Sure If Sex Was Tantric
SCARSDALE, NY — Following two hours of stilted, uncomfortable intercourse in which the couple started and stopped at various times, Jeff and Kara DiMarco speculated Saturday as to whether they had just engaged in tantric sex. "I'm pretty sure it was tantric," said Jeff DiMarco, adding that he and his wife skimmed an Esquire article about tantra last month, and that what they did Saturday was "like that, sort of. " "We were definitely breathing together, and I know I didn't climax, even though I came close a few times. And I think we transmitted energy. Honey, we transmitted energy, right? " Wife Kara later told reporters that she was pretty sure her chakra had been stimulated at some point Saturday, but she couldn't say for sure.

Police: iPhone Left In Hot Car For Three Hours
WINNETKA, IL — This normally peaceful suburban town is still reeling following the news Monday that a local resident, whose name is being withheld by police pending a full investigation, left an iPhone unattended for more than three hours in a car parked in the hot sun. "Responding to calls from concerned passersby, who observed the iPhone sitting in a vehicle in the parking lot of the Westfield Shopping Center, police arrived on the scene at approximately 4 p.m. and immediately intervened to save the device," said Winnetka police chief Douglas Blaine. "Security cameras have shown that the iPhone had been in the car — with the doors locked and the windows rolled up — since 1 p.m. Due to the tragic and highly emotional nature of this case, we cannot say any more at this time. According to official police records, two officers forcibly broke into the car at 4:07 p.m. and found the iPhone lying face down on the dashboard. The iPhone at first showed no signs of life, but after a tense few seconds, officers were able to wake it and get it to respond to a series of simple touch commands. Police said that if the iPhone were left in the extreme heat for any longer, it could have died. The iPhone was rushed by ambulance to a nearby Apple facility for careful examination. Miraculously, no damage to its memory, screen, or wireless capabilities was reported. Upper-middle-class suburbanites from all over the North Shore area have reacted to the near-tragedy with an unprecedented outpouring of concern. Hundreds of cards and letters have come streaming in, and local talk radio shows have been flooded with calls demanding that the iPhone's owner be prosecuted. Many have come forward offering to take the iPhone into their custody, and still more have donated free downloads, ringtones, and MP3s to the victimized object. Although the device was unharmed, Winnetka residents expressed shock and dismay that something like this could occur in their normally materially conscious community. "What kind of a human being is capable of such callous disregard for a precious, precious thing? " said one concerned Winnetka resident, tax lawyer Ben Klein. "Having an iPhone is a 24-hour-a-day responsibility. "This iPhone was less than a year old," said Janelle Mankewiecz, another outraged citizen. "If someone is blessed with an iPhone, especially one of the newer models like this one, they should never take their eyes off it for even one second. "On a hot day, the temperatures inside a parked car can reach 150 degrees in just 40 minutes," she added, looking up the information on her own iPhone. Witnesses said that when the iPhone's owner eventually arrived at her car and realized what she had done, she began sobbing hysterically, calling out in vain for her iPhone, and rocking back and forth on the parking lot pavement while repeatedly shouting "No" and "This can't be happening. " The owner is currently being held by authorities and will likely be charged with criminal neglect. If found guilty, she will be subject to severe punitive action, including fines and possible jail time, and the iPhone will be placed under foster care. The iPhone's owner issued a statement through her attorney. "My client deeply regrets the incident, and wishes to express a sincere apology to the police, the community, and the fine manufacturers at Apple," said lawyer Henry Durst, who was retained by the suspect following her arrest. "My client is remorseful and clearly emotionally distraught. This is her first iPhone." Nonetheless, local government officials remain disturbed by what they are calling "inhuman" treatment of the iPhone. "My husband and I have been trying for months, but so far, we've been unable to have an iPhone," town assemblywoman Janet Nuetreer said. "But if we did, we would understand that there is nothing more important. Every iPhone is a gift from God." "Sadly, this sort of mistreatment of iPhones is more widespread than people think," said Dr. Jordan Heimlich, director of Winnetka Community Services, who is currently supervising the iPhone's care. "People leave their iPhones precariously perched on the edges of counters, they forget to charge them, they even fail to provide them with basic necessities like a decorative carrying case. I've even heard cases of iPhones being dropped. "But I've never seen anything like this happen here in Winnetka before," he added. "It's sad to see how out of line so many people's basic priorities are. Authorities added that it was "just sheer luck" that the toddler who was also left in the car was unconscious at the time, as otherwise he could have potentially damaged the iPhone.

Goofy Guy Named Gary Enlivens Otherwise Intolerable Wedding Reception
MINOT, ND — At the outdoor wedding reception of Kevin Thomas and Elaine Schroeder on Saturday, a party guest identified only as "Gary" alleviated tensions and endeared himself to guests with his unpredictable and irreverent actions, turning the miserable event into one of marginal tolerability, sources reported Monday. "I'm not sure who he is, but that Gary guy was the best thing about the wedding," said Warren Thomas, Kevin's father. "My wife must have invited him, because he sure couldn't have been a friend of sticks-in-the-mud like the Schroeders." According to other guests, Gary, estimated to be in his late 50s, seemed to have attended the event alone. Although he made his biggest impression at the reception, witnesses said he was present at St. Paul's Catholic Church during the ceremony. "The first time I noticed [Gary] was in the church," best man Joseph Farrel said. "The flower girl kept giggling during the vows. It took me a while to realize [Gary] was making faces at her. It was pretty funny, I guess. Then after the ceremony, I ran into [Gary] in the bathroom. He came up to the urinal next to mine and said, 'This must be where all the dicks hang out.' Normally, I'd punch out any guy who tried to talk to me in the john, but the joke was a relief after listening to those awful self-written vows. According to guests at the reception, relations between the Thomases and the Schroeders have been strained since January, when Elaine announced that she was not taking Thomas as a last name. Additional tensions arose when the Schroeders learned that Kevin was not Catholic and did not want a church wedding. Guests said these factors, among others, lent the event an air of discord from the start. At the reception, however, Gary reportedly lightened the mood by telling jokes, singing, and repeatedly clinking his glass to make the bride and groom kiss. "There was this funny-looking guy [Gary] at the table next to mine," said Jeanie Schroeder, Elaine's cousin. "He was cracking people up by making a tie out of one of the streamers hanging from the ceiling. Meanwhile, at my table, everyone was just gossiping about how Kevin made so much less money than Elaine's first fiancé. I kept thinking, 'I wish I was sitting at the goofy guy's table.' After dinner, guests milled about the tent, making uncomfortable small talk about relatives and complaining about the middling quality of the buffet food and the cost of drinks at the cash bar. As the evening wore on, the children and more adventurous guests gravitated toward Gary, who told corny jokes, pretended to steal items from the gift table, and did impersonations of celebrities. "That Gary was doing this impersonation of Father Spencer performing the service with a thick lisp," said Gilbert Szigmond, a friend from the Schroeders' parish. "I usually wouldn't stand for someone showing disrespect for a man of the cloth, but the levity was welcome relief after that hostile toast by Kevin's mother. It was the only thing that kept me from ducking out before the cake was served. An informal poll of the wedding guests and hosts revealed that no one was certain who invited Gary, but all were relieved that he was present. "Everyone lined up for the cha-cha slide, and it was like 'Oh, boy, here we go,'" said groomsman Jeff Canzanovia. "I had to dance with [bridesmaid and Elaine's sister] Erica Schroeder, who I can't stand, but we were all going through the motions to make Kevin and Elaine happy. Then this guy [Gary] comes onto the dance floor and acts like he can't dance, pretending to trip and fall. I usually hate ridiculous behavior like that, but I have to admit his antics were pretty much the only thing that made the night halfway bearable. The level of barely suppressed tension turned into outright hostility when the groom's brother, David Thomas, got into a fight with the DJ. "By the time we had to catch the bouquet, we were all pretty much fed up," bridesmaid Helen Perry said. "The fight really freaked everyone out — Elaine's family is pretty strict, and that's putting it nice. No one was mingling, and everyone was just sort of sitting quietly at their tables and waiting until they could slip out unnoticed. But when the DJ announced that all the single women should line up, that guy [Gary] ran over, jumping and clapping and pretending to be really excited to catch the bouquet. Elaine's dad gave him a look, but Gary didn't seem to care. By the end of the reception, the room was nearly empty, except for a handful of stragglers and Gary, who wished the newlyweds well. "Ordinarily, a guy like Gary would annoy the shit out of me," the bride said. "But between the fights and my little sister getting plastered and Grandma not showing up because Kevin's not Catholic, that Gary was the one thing stopping me from screaming at everyone to get out and let me start my new life with my husband. Added Kevin: "Yeah, where did that Gary dude come from?

New York Marathon Winner Tests Positive For Performance-Enhancing Horse
NEW YORK — Officials from New York Road Runners stripped American Meb Keflezighi of his 2009 ING New York City Marathon victory Wednesday after a blood sample taken from his fetlock was found to contain high levels of performance-enhancing horse. "Meb's fellow competitors voiced their doubts about him immediately after the event," NYRR president Mary Wittenberg said. "In addition to his remarkable speed, unusual race-day height, and distinctive 'clip-clop' gait, Keflezighi's frequent nickering caused the other runners to speculate that he may have been using a horse in some fashion. Added Wittenberg, "Also, just before the start, he lifted up his tail and loudly deposited a 9-inch-high pile of steaming fecal matter on the pavement, an unusual occurrence even in the world of long-distance running. Keflezighi finished the race in 48 minutes and 12 seconds, easily setting a new world record and defeating his nearest competitor by one hour and 20 minutes. Course workers, spectators, and event sponsors have all presented damaging evidence pointing toward Keflezighi's use of equine enhancements. Volunteers working refreshment tables during the race said Keflezighi took water only twice — at miles nine and 17 — consuming roughly 10 gallons each time, and was the only professional runner in the men's event to request an oat, carrot, and sugar lump station. In addition, a spokesman for Nike told reporters the company provided Keflezighi with six shoes for the marathon, four of which required special construction before being nailed onto his feet. Hundreds of people who watched the race have also come forward with photographs showing Keflezighi mounted atop what experts now believe to be a 2-to-4-year-old chestnut-brown thoroughbred. "Come to think of it, he was moving at a pace that didn't seem human," spectator Mark Rolland said. "And when the marathon was over, the American flag they tried to drape around him didn't even come close to fitting around his body. "Last year he was just this small guy, but when he showed up to the starting line this year, his neck and head were noticeably thicker," said David Willey, editor in chief of Runner's World magazine. "He looked like he had put on at least a half ton of muscle. The NYRR's Wittenberg said during a postrace press conference that if the evidence proves conclusively that Keflezighi used a horse to improve his speed and endurance, it would not only have a severe impact on his career, but could cast doubt on the whole culture of long-distance running. "It may seem hard to believe this could happen, especially at this level," said Dr. Raymond Prentiss, a medical adviser for USA Track & Field. "But people are so eager to believe in man's ability to push the boundaries of achievement that they blind themselves to a competitor who looks a little too strong, runs a mile a few minutes faster, and stands a few hands taller than the competition. "In Keflezighi's case, we ignored what his rapidly improving times, flowing mane, and shapely withers were trying to tell us until it was too late," Prentiss added. "The fact that he was spending an hour after each event currycombing should have been a major tip-off." As of press time, Keflezighi is cooperating with the sanctioning bodies and has returned the $170,000 he was awarded for the victory. He has also surrendered his racing singlet and shorts, saddle, saddle blanket, and bridle for further inspection and testing by technical personnel. Officials with the World Marathon Majors series said that Keflezighi will likely be banned from future races, including Boston, Chicago, the 2010 Belmont Stakes, and Berlin. In light of the discovery, marathon officials are taking a closer look at many of the entrants in this year's race, including British runner Paula Radcliffe, a former winner who placed a tearful fourth in the women's event after fracturing her cannon bone and had to be put down mere minutes after finishing.

Boss' Going-Away Party A Little Too Jubilant
AMES, IA — The Oct. 22 office going-away party for Karl Roberts, manager for the past five years at Ames Farm Products Wholesalers, Inc., was "a little too jubilant," the 38-year-old former boss reported Monday. "This staff has been working directly under me for a long time, so it's only natural that they'd want to show their appreciation by throwing a little shindig on my last day," said Roberts, who recently accepted a job as regional director of Quad-State Shipping in Rockford, IL. "And it's only natural that the employees would want to blow off a little steam at the end of the week. Even so, I really wasn't expecting much more than cake, punch, a couple of warm wishes, and maybe a card. Frankly, I was surprised when I found out they'd hired a band. Known for his "by the book" management style, Roberts said he worked much more closely with Ames Farm Products' 23 staff members than their previous manager. While he said he was aware that he had a reputation for being "something of a hard-ass" in his first months on the job, he had always assumed that the staff appreciated his contributions to increased productivity and professionalism in the workplace. "After the party, though, I'm not sure what to think," Roberts said. "It was nice of them to sign a card for me. I'm not sure why it had to be a three-foot-tall card emblazoned with a huge smiley face and the message 'Good Luck, Boss! Don't Let The Door Hit Your Ass On The Way Out!'" "I know they were only joking about wanting me to go," Roberts added. "But everyone sure was getting into the joke. The party, which was announced with photocopied flyers taped to nearly every wall in the office, was scheduled to last from "5:30 p.m. til ???" "When our old receptionist Janice left last year, we had a party that lasted maybe an hour," Roberts said. "There were maybe 10 people left by the end. You'd figure that on a Friday, people would want to go home and get a head start on their weekend. I didn't leave my party until 10:30, and it was still going strong. If anything, it seemed to be picking up speed. "I had to go," Roberts added. "I'd already heard that 'Na Na Na, Hey Hey Hey' song about 30 times. On the way out to his car, Roberts said he was surprised to meet two former Ames Farm Products sales representatives making their way to the party with a keg of beer. "I was surprised to see Jim and Travis, both of whom quit last May. They said some of the other employees called them and told them I was finally leaving and so they came back to see me off," Roberts said. "I thought that 'finally' was a little strange, since I only announced I was leaving two weeks ago. According to employees who attended it, the going-away party was a smashing success. "Everyone was in a great mood," inventory clerk Jim Fulton said. "I can't remember everything that happened, because I was pretty drunk by the end of the night, but I do recall leading the conga line through Karl's empty office. Fulton's coworker Sheila Wuronski, Roberts' former assistant, agreed that the party was a hit. "Wow, what a super night! " Wuronski said. "I'd say it was the single best day Ames Farm Products has had in five years. Roberts said he would have preferred a cordial and sincere send-off to the raucous one that he received. "I guess people were too busy enjoying themselves to get sentimental," Roberts said. "I wasn't expecting sobs, but I don't think anyone even got misty. People gave me goodbye hugs, but they weren't 'we'll miss you'-type hugs. Twice, I was lifted off the ground and swung around in circles. It was nice to see such a strong outpouring of emotion, I guess, but I wasn't expecting so much whooping and hollering. "I heard they eventually got a call from the retirement center across the street because of all the noise," Roberts added. In spite of his uneasy feelings about the office-wide blowout, Roberts said he is looking forward to continuing his career at Quad-State Shipping. "I'm excited by the challenges facing me at Quad-State," Roberts said. "They need a new dress code and lunch policy. Somebody has to crack down on the time-clock violations. And sick days and personal days seem to be overlapping in an unacceptable way. But, with a little discipline and attention to detail, I'll whip the place into shape. "Ames was great," Roberts added. "But I admit that I'm looking forward to a change. The new environment will provide a chance to not only move on in my career, but also make new friends.

McDonald's Drops 'Hammurderer' Character From Advertising
OAK BROOK, IL — Bowing to outcry from consumers and parents groups, the McDonald's Corporation announced Monday that it is discontinuing its new advertising mascot, "The Hammurderer," a mischievous, homicidal imp who kills McDonaldland characters and takes their sandwiches. Developed by Chicago advertising agency DDB Needham, the Hammurderer made his debut two months ago and has since appeared in a series of Saturday-morning television commercials, as well as on Happy Meal bags and activity placemats. All appearances by and references to the violent, ill-tempered prison escapee will be dropped. "Over the years, McDonald's has successfully introduced a number of new characters whose defining characteristic is a certain measure of comical, criminal intent," said Andrew Perlich, McDonald's vice-president of promotions. "Such shady characters as The Hamburglar, The Goblins, and the bloodthirsty pirate Captain Crook have all fit nicely into the McDonald's advertising universe. We had every reason to believe that the Hammurderer, with his long rap sheet of burger-related crimes and his signature cry of 'Stabble Stabble Stabble,' would take his place in this proud lineage of McDonaldland mischief-makers." The Hammurderer's Jan. 11 debut ad — in which he seizes and devours the McDonald's Happy Meal Guys, oblivious to their frantic screams — earned poor marks from parents and child-development experts, who feared the spot might send the message to children that killing is acceptable. Several weeks later, more controversy erupted over the promotional coloring book "Shivved In The McRibs," in which the Hammurderer decapitates Mayor McCheese and eats his head. Responding to widespread public outrage, McDonald's executives defended the coloring book as "not nearly as violent or socially irresponsible as it has been made out to be, given that the Mayor's head is, in fact, a giant and conceivably edible cheeseburger." But the uproar over the latest commercial, in which Birdie The Early Bird is garroted by the Hammurderer and her body tossed in a Dumpster, was vociferous enough to prompt the fast-food giant to pull the plug. "We are sensitive to the concerns of parents and will immediately begin phasing out this character," Perlich said. "Whether we will remove him from commercials without explanation or write him out of the spots with a bloody police standoff, we have yet to decide. But we're confident the Hammurderer will be off the national radar by April." Hammurderer toys and promotional items, which include dolls, T-shirts, ski masks, and spiked bats, have been recalled and are expected to become prized collectibles. This is not the first time a McDonald's character has stirred controversy for its violent nature. In 1982, the company introduced "Shakes McJunkie," an emaciated addict who robbed characters of their possessions, which he then sold to buy McDonald's shakes. He was later reworked as "The Machead," a homeless, wild-eyed Big Mac addict who turned to panhandling and gay prostitution as a means of supporting his severe burger habit. The Hammurderer is quickly becoming regarded as the worst-received advertising mascot since Kool-Aid's 1989 discontinuation of "The Grapist," a huge purple monster who sodomizes thirsty children.

Six-Year-Old's Birthday Party Hampered By 85,000 Gallons of Combustible Fuel Oil
ERIE, PA — There was nothing left below the knees of three party-goers yesterday, as 85,000 gallons of combustible fuel oil gushed through the living room of 6-year-old Kenny Dodds, scorching everything in its path. "Kenny had a wonderful time," said his mother, Diane Dodds, speaking from her bed in the intensive care burn ward at Erie County Medical Center. "Nevertheless, I don't think he can help feeling that the party could have been better. He's very sensitive that way. The birthday party, which included "pin the tail on the donkey," prizes for all of Kenny's guests, and a surprise appearance by Bilbo the Funtime Clown, was going smoothly, showing no signs of interruption by a massive flow of highly flammable petrochemicals until just before cake was to be served. "I smelled a chemical, burning smell," said Jeanette Frederickson, a neighbor who attended the party with her daughter Ashley. "Then this tidal wave of burning, toxic liquid just burst through the front door, pouring through the windows, literally vaporizing everything within a couple feet of the ground. I don't want to say it ruined the party, but, well, things just weren't really the same after that. Midtown Clowns, from whom the Doddses contracted Bilbo for the party, said it has seen a lot during its 30 years of party clown-providing, but combustible fuel oil was never more than an inconvenience. "Sure, we've had our problems with fuel oil," said Maury Friedman, senior dispatcher at Midtown Clowns. "It's terrible stuff. If it doesn't catch fire, it will still ruin your upholstery. And ingesting it, well, that's a whole other story. The precise volume of the spill is believed to be 85,550 gallons, making it the largest ever to occur at a birthday party, surpassing the 1972 Melissa Tilly Eighth Birthday mishap by some 3,000 gallons. "It'll be nice to get out of the hospital," said Diane Dodds, "but I'm not looking forward to cleaning up that mess. I've got Yvonne and Karen coming over for coffee Sunday, and Yvonne is such a snoop I just know she'll be asking all kinds of questions about the missing walls, my missing legs and the unmarked semi-tanker in my rose bushes. When asked to comment on what happened at his birthday party, Kenny burst into tears and jumped up and down on the spot where his bed once stood, screaming, "I wanted a pony! I wanted a pony!

'Six Flags Killer' Still At Large, Say Souvenir-Bedecked Police
GURNEE, IL — Local authorities continue to search Gurnee's Great America theme park for a criminal dubbed "The Six Flags Killer," souvenir-laden police reported Monday. "If you have any information that might lead to the capture of this vicious killer, please contact us immediately," a button-covered Gurnee Police Captain Jack Moynihan said at a press conference held in Carousel Plaza. "We have officers standing by on the Whizzer." "Oh," Moynihan added. "And if you know where to get one of those blinking hats we've been seeing around, let us know. Police began their search on Aug. 26, when ride operator Zack Lipton, 16, found a decapitated body behind the Fiddler's Fling control booth. Two days later, the remains of Six Flags employee Cory Reader were found in the bushes at the perimeter of the Yukon Territory, still inside his Wile E. Coyote suit. Park-goers reported sightings of a blood-covered man in the vicinity of the crimes, leading police to believe that both murders were committed by the same 35- to 45-year-old Caucasian male. Police have been combing the attraction for clues, thoroughly investigating every ride, game, snack bar, gift shop, and photo-sticker booth. "We started our search in Yukon Territory and fanned out to Yankee Harbor and Orleans Place," Moynihan said. "We've got a whole squad on the Sky Trek Tower. If anything suspicious happens, we'll be sure to see it from our vantage point on the bridge by Splash Water Falls." "I urge the public to cooperate with any officers forced to butt in line," Moynihan added, as he shifted his grip on a three-foot-tall, plush Bugs Bunny. "It's a lot of ground to cover in one day, as you all know. Moynihan said his first priority is to ensure the safety of Great America employees and visitors. To that end, he has stationed an officer in the front car of every ride in the park. "I have men working in shifts on rides, from 10 a.m. until the park closes at 8 p.m.," Moynihan said. "Officers from neighboring departments have volunteered to cover some of the more popular attractions, such as the American Eagle and Superman: Ultimate Flight." Moynihan had to develop a unique system to oversee the patrol of a park as big and fun as Great America. "We gather by the double-decker Columbia Carousel twice a day to compare notes, discuss leads, and eat funnel cakes," Moynihan said. "We also keep in constant radio contact with one another. Instead of the usual 'all clear,' we've been using an updated, site-specific check-in." When pressed, Moynihan said, "The check-in signal is 'Wheeeeee!'" Looking for a killer in a theme park has created its share of problems, Moynihan admitted. "The crowds, the noise, and the overall jovial atmosphere have been distracting," Moynihan said. "We've limited our searches to weekdays, because on weekends, the lines here are nutso. Cost has also hindered the daily patrols. The city of Gurnee bought season passes for 50 police officers, but the admission fee is far from the only expense the department incurs. "We've been trying to stay within a budget," Moynihan said. "You'd think that once you paid admission, you'd be covered. But then there's parking, souvenirs, and game tickets. And food here is outrageous. Ten dollars for a burger and a Coke? If we didn't have to keep a constant presence in the park, our officers never knowing when or where the killer might strike next, we'd probably bring a cooler full of sandwiches and eat in the parking lot. Moynihan said he hopes for a break in the case before the end of the season, but is willing to personally supervise the investigation through the Six Flags' Fright Fest, which begins Oct. 11. "As adventure-filled as this investigation has been, we can't focus all of our man power on Great America," Moynihan said. "By now, the killer could be as far away as Magic Mountain." Moynihan ended the press conference with an ultimatum, which was later broadcast over the park's public-address system. "You will not get away with this," said Moynihan, shaking a fistful of cotton candy at the still-at-large assailant. "We will find you if we have to fingerprint every Skee-Lo game in the park.

Stephen Hawking Builds Robotic Exoskeleton
CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND — Nobel Prize-winning physicist Stephen Hawking stunned the international scientific community Monday with his latest breakthrough, a remarkably advanced cybernetic exoskeleton designed to replace his wheelchair. Hawking, paralyzed since early adulthood with the degenerative nerve disease ALS, unveiled the new creation at a press conference at Cambridge University. "I am faster, stronger… better than before," Hawking told reporters via his suit's built-in voice synthesizer. The hulking, hydraulically powered titanium-alloy exoskeleton is expected to assist the famed Brief History Of Time author tremendously in his ongoing theoretical physics research. "With the new exoskeleton, Stephen will be able to safely handle radioactive isotopes in the high-radiation area of the new supercollider particle accelerator. And his new robo-arms are capable of ripping open enemy tanks like they were nutshells," said Cambridge physics chair Sir Geoffrey Neville Shropshire-Kent. The exoskeleton is also equipped with special infra-vision goggles, which will allow Hawking to observe sub-atomic phenomena firsthand. "Wait a minute," said Hawking, testing out the high-tech infra-vision goggles for the first time. "I see now that the curvature of space-time follows previously unmeasured vectors that I will need to recalibrate in my equations. Also, there appears to be some sort of trouble on the moon. Among the suit's other features: laser terminals; oxygen pressure-tanks for deep-sea and outer-space research; jet boots; and the most advanced crime-lab database in the world. Constructed in Hawking's secret underground headquarters over the last two years by the famed scientist and his orphaned teenage sidekick and research assistant Hawk-Lad, the exoskeleton has already proven invaluable, not only in increasing the paralyzed Hawking's mobility, but in rounding up the notorious international gang of diamond thieves known as "The Fearsome Four." The $55 million exoskeleton, which Hawking operates through slight movements of his left wrist, is powered by a pair of bio-morphogenetic servo-motors, and boasts the most advanced cyber-robotic technology anywhere, freeing Hawking of the wheelchair in which he has been confined for much of his adult life and giving him greater freedom of movement when engaged in battle. "Beware, would-be evildoers," Hawking said. "My crimefighting powers are as infinite and unknowable as the very universe itself. As for the future, Hawking said he plans to continue teaching and hopes to take a sabbatical in Italy with his wife and nurse. But primarily, he will focus on preparing for his greatest mission yet: a descent into a black hole in mid-1998. "Only by penetrating the event horizon itself will I be able to observe the effects of singularity on neutrino decay and complete my research," Hawking said. "It should also prove invaluable in the construction of my new Anti-Gravity Gun. It may be our only hope for stopping Monstro, The Living Behemoth." Hawking has already received the International Science League award for his invention, as well as a prestigious chair at the Helsinki Cybernetics Institute. He is also widely regarded as the favorite to win this year's Nobel Prize For Physics, and he recently received an honorary key to New York from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani after saving the city from the Galactons.

Bronx Zoo Unveils New Loitering-Teens Exhibit
BRONX, NY — After months of public anticipation, the Bronx Zoo finally opened its new loitering-teens exhibit Saturday. The state-of-the-art exhibit, constructed over the past 10 months at a cost of $4.5 million, drew record crowds to the zoo this weekend. Loitering teens are indigenous to many urban and suburban areas across the U.S., but this is the first time they have been captured for display in a public zoo. "They are fascinating," said Raymond Fehr, 51, a member of the Bronx Zoo board of directors and the man who oversaw the development of the exhibit. "The public will enjoy watching them hang out and smoke in an attractive natural setting. The loitering-teens exhibit faithfully recreates the species' natural habitat, boasting a city-street facade that features a full-scale replica video arcade, piercing parlor and Taco Bell. A special "concrete park" area, suitable for skateboarding, has also been included to give the teens exercise. According to Bronx Zoo director of exhibits John Gilkey, the zoo's 15 loitering-teen specimens appear to enjoy their new home and are responding well to their three daily feedings of Meximelts and Mountain Dew. "They're really adjusting nicely," Gilkey said. "They've already started to spit, and I think that, within a couple of weeks, they'll be just about ready to start asking for spare change. Despite the relatively smooth adjustment, one lesson zoo officials learned quickly was not to introduce older humans into the loitering teens' pen. When this happened, Gilkey said, the teens became enraged and ran around the cage screaming, "You just don't understand me, mom! Also of concern to zoo officials are the mating rituals of the teens, who appear to be awkward and ill-at-ease around members of the opposite sex. "We're hoping to get them to mate," Gilkey said. "But, thus far, all they seem interested in doing is shoplifting magazines and hiding from someone they call 'Johnny Law.'" The Bronx Zoo's newest arrivals are a hit with the public. Plastic-toy replicas of the loitering teens are a best-seller at the zoo gift shop, and there is talk of opening a petting area so humans can interact with them on a limited basis. "I like the one in the Charlotte Hornets jacket," said zoo visitor Jenny Thaler, 9. "He's got funny red dots all over his face. If last weekend's visitor numbers continue, the loitering-teens exhibit has a chance at surpassing "Women In Our Midst" as the biggest draw in zoo history.

Suspect Wins Over Detectives With 'Rockford Files' Reference
PASCO, WA — Having just arrested him on suspicion of aggravated assault and robbery, Pasco police officials dropped all charges against Carl Bradley, 46, after the man made multiple amusing references to The Rockford Files, a 1970s detective series starring James Garner. Just moments after Bradley asked whether the interrogating officer was working for "$200 a day, plus expenses," a roomful of officers began joyously exchanging plotlines and quotes from their favorite episodes. "It's just nice to meet a guy who appreciates The Files like we do," officer Brad Nuter said. "How could anyone who can recite every single answering-machine gag possibly have beaten two newlyweds with the butt of his gun over $30? This man has a code, just like Jimbo Rockford." Following Bradley's release, investigators detained a vagrant who was overheard misquoting the radio banter from the opening credit sequence of Adam-12.

Chinese Takeout Restaurant Thought It Had Seen Man At His Worst
BROOKLYN, NY — Despite thinking that they had witnessed 28-year-old Dean Rumergant at his absolute lowest Monday, employees of the Jade Kitchen 2 restaurant realized their error Tuesday afternoon, when the weary freelance designer entered the Chinese eatery wearing a single shoe and a clump of dried duck sauce in his three-day-old beard. "Oh my God," said cashier Lin Zhou, who added that she initially thought Rumergant was a patient from the nearby methadone clinic. "He wouldn't look at me or say anything. He just pointed to menu on the wall and walked away. " According to employees, Rumergant waited for his order by slumping down in the corner and resting his head on a collapsed stack of menus.

ANN ARBOR, MI — Although there is a slim chance the darn things might have rolled under the stove, Michigan resident Irene Sullivan, 50, stated conclusively Sunday that buttons, like the nice red ones on her favorite sweater, cannot simply vanish without a trace. "I know they don't just sprout legs and walk away, that's for sure," Sullivan told reporters from her position on all fours below the kitchen table. "Oh, for crying out loud, is that a baby carrot under the fridge? " The mother of two could not provide any further information as to why these things always happen right before church, but did refer back to an earlier declaration that if it's not one thing, it's another.

Richard Branson's Global-Warming Donation Nearly As Much As Cost Of Failed Balloon Trips
LONDON — Analysts are predicting that the $3 billion Sir Richard Branson has pledged for developing energy sources to combat global warming could come close to matching the amount the entrepreneur, adventurer, and Virgin CEO has already spent on elaborate balloon-based excursions. "This unprecedented and extremely generous investment rivals the amounts Branson spent on his many, many failed attempts to circumnavigate the Earth in a balloon," Wall Street stock analyst Madeleine Brauner said. "He's setting a wonderful example for ultrarich environmentalists everywhere. Branson also reportedly plans to invest billions more on a time machine that would enable him to prevent the creation of Virgin Airways, reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by some four percent worldwide.

Area Girlfriend, Boyfriend Achieve Perfect Mother-Son Relationship
PORTLAND, OR — After dating for nearly three years, area couple Peter Mazursky and Janet Hyams have finally achieved the perfect semblance of a mother-son relationship, sources close to the pair revealed Monday. "My little pumpkin would practically be helpless without me," said Hyams, 28, whose role in the adult relationship has slowly transformed from romantic lover to maternal caregiver over time. "I have to supervise almost everything he does, from making sure he gets up in the morning, to reminding him about his doctors' appointments. I even have to pick out his clothes for him when we go shopping together. Added Hyams, "I don't know how Pete would survive if I weren't around. The couple — who met in 2005 and have been living together since Mazursky was evicted from his apartment — have not always had it so easy. In the beginning, their interpersonal style still contained many troubling elements of a mature relationship, including periodic moments of independence, mutual equality, and even occasional sexual contact. Luckily for the pair, this early period of instability quickly began to break down as arguments over Mazursky's irresponsibility and Hyams' controlling personality gave way to the codependent harmony they now share. "She takes care of me," said Mazursky, 26, unconsciously looking to Hyams for approval. "With Janet, I never have to worry about stuff like picking up after myself, or remembering to brush my teeth before I go to bed. Plus, she always makes all of the big decisions for both of us, which is nice. Since falling into preprogrammed roles from early childhood, the couple have seen their relationship undergo a number of significant changes. Sexual intercourse, once a favorite and frequent pastime, has steadily dropped off in regularity, ceasing altogether earlier this month. "We don't have to be having sex all the time to be happy," said Mazursky, who by this point has entirely sublimated his libido under the weight of his projected need for a maternal protector. "Right now we are focusing on other things, like losing weight. We have a system worked out where I can only eat cookies with Janet's say-so, and if she catches me eating one without permission, she gets to 'ground' me from snacks for a week. It's so great to be able to share that level of intimacy with another person. "My old girlfriend Jessica used to let me eat all the cookies I wanted," he added. "We just didn't have the same kind of bond that Janet and I now share. Hyams' maternal duties include always paying the rent for Mazursky and then hounding him to get a job, performing basic household chores to make herself feel useful and needed, and monitoring Mazursky to make sure he doesn't exceed his allotted three hours of video games per day. In return, Mazursky's duties include playing touch football with his friends, giving Hyams someone to subconsciously feel superior to, making the bed after being yelled at to do so, and allowing Hyams to lick her finger and wipe smudges off his face before they go outside. "When we first met, I knew there was something special about Pete — he was like a big teddy bear you just wanted to tuck into bed," Hyams explained. "That's not to say we don't still have our problems. Sometimes he throws a tantrum when he doesn't want to do the dishes, and I have to discipline him. But when he falls asleep with his head in my lap, it's all worth it. Mazursky agrees. "I'm really happy with Janet," he said. "Not every guy's got a girlfriend who calls him from work to make sure he's had lunch. I guess I'm just one lucky kid. "I really love Mom — I mean, Janet," Mazursky added.

'Old Milwaukee Book Of World Records' Confirms Title For Most Punches To Shoulder
MILWAUKEE — In a ceremony held Tuesday at Milwaukee City Hall, local resident Phillip Schneider, 27, was officially recognized by the Old Milwaukee Book Of World Records for being punched in the shoulder the most times in one hour. "We are proud to bestow this honor on Mr. Schneider after he withstood 29 strikes to the upper arm from his friend Mike, who is a pretty big guy," OMBWR committee chief Gerald Foster said of Schneider's feat, which beat the previous record by four punches. "Congratulations. Please accept this six-pack and a $15 gift certificate to Shopko." Schneider's achievement completes a busy week for the record compendium during which Laura Penipeno of Winnebago, WI was given the title of "World's Tallest Cashier" and Dave Pinski from New Berlin, WI was honored for having the world's coolest idea for a stunt.

Study: 74% Of Children Tenting Out In Yard Don't Make It Through The Night
WASHINGTON — According to a new report released this week by the Department of Health and Human Services, 74 percent of all American children camping out in their backyards never, ever make it through the night. The study, which surveyed hundreds of innocent children between the ages of 7 and 12, found that, in almost all cases, sleeping outdoors in a tent with a flashlight and comic books and who knows what else lurking around in the dark ended in horrible tragedy. "We now have definitive proof that most children who camp out in their yards will die a horrific death," said Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services. "Whether it's a sudden wolf attack, an escaped mental patient, or just Old Man Greenly, who lost his hand in a gruesome mill accident and now seeks his bloody revenge, young boys and girls rarely live to see their parents or friends again. Conducted over the course of two months, the study documented nearly 18,345 ways in which children, who never suspected a thing until it was far too late, met their grisly demise. In 29 percent of all recorded cases, young campers were chopped up into tiny pieces by fugitive axe murderers. While a shocking 32 percent of kids, snacking on potato chips and candy bars, awakened the ghost of a little baby boy named Jeremy. According to the study, 100 percent of all children tried to scream and yell for help, but nothing came out. "Though a terrifying scenario, kids should not worry too much about the prospect of being attacked by killer ghosts," said Dr. Howard Fredericks, the study's chief researcher and a professor of forensic biology at Columbia University. "Especially since our data suggests they're three times more likely to be kidnapped by the Very Lonely Woman Who Lives in the Woods." "She's this horrible-looking woman with scabs all over her face who had her children taken away by the state," Fredericks continued. "She now roams across the suburbs at night, crying and wailing, and mistaking young kids playing inside their tents for her own. Although Fredericks claimed that the odds of an unsuspecting child surviving until morning were slim, he did issue a list of warning signs to watch for. The sound of a nearby twig snapping, Fredericks said, almost always indicates that a half-man, half-lizard swamp creature, who feeds on the organs of schoolchildren while they're still alive, is on the prowl. In addition, the study found that turning off one's flashlight or closing one's eyes for "even a second" is an open invitation to all disfigured hitchhikers in the area to suddenly attack. "Children should know, however, that if they hear scratching on the side of their tent, it's probably just their older brother trying to scare them," Fredericks said. "And if the scratching suddenly stops, it's most likely because their parents have gone insane and crept up from behind with this really demonic look in their eyes and slit his throat. As dire as these findings may appear, Fredericks claimed there was one way for children camping outdoors to escape their fate. "If they are able to avoid being bitten by poisonous spiders crawling around inside their sleeping bag, can keep all their fingers and toes crossed long enough to ward off Sister Mary, and manage to run back home without the inbred family of cannibal people seeing them first, they may actually stand a chance," said Fredericks, an eerie smile forming on his lips. "But even if they do, there's no telling what they'll find once they get inside. "And I should know," he added, pulling out a gleaming butcher knife from behind his back. "I'm in there now.

Hercules Still Struggling To Complete 13th Labor
GREENSBORO, NC — Stating that he had not yet fulfilled the labors set forth by Eurystheus to the satisfaction of the Mycenaean king, mythic hero Hercules announced Monday that for the 35th time in 3,000 years he will run for Greensboro City Council. While many are familiar with the 12 labors of Hercules, it is not as widely known that the Greek demigod failed to successfully complete his sixth task, killing the man-eating, bronze-winged birds of Stymphalus. Though his arrows slew many of the feathered beasts, several escaped, and as a result, Hercules was given a 13th labor to complete before he could know peace. "I must pay penance for the murder of my wife and children," Hercules said. "So spoke the Oracle at Delphi. And to do so, King Eurystheus, servant of Hera and my most loathed cousin, has decreed that I must be justly elected to the City Council of Greensboro, District 2, currently held by Goldie Wells." To complete his new task, Hercules first had to wait several millennia for the New World to be discovered and colonized, for democratic ideals to flourish during the Age of Enlightenment, and for the United States be founded and win its independence. He then had to move to North Carolina, become a naturalized citizen, and wait until the town of Greensboro was incorporated in 1829. When this was done, he established residency in the fledgling town and waited an additional 100 years for the second district to take form, at which point he began his numerous campaigns. Past elections have met with little success for the son of Zeus and Alcmena. His Pantheon Party does not have the support to qualify for matching funds, and several past opponents have run negative ads against him, citing Hercules' insolence in believing he is an equal to the gods, his proclivity to run off for a year at a time to chase bulls, and his dalliances with male companion Iolaus. "I remember well the election of 1988," Hercules said. "It was the closest one to date. But the night before the polls opened, my opponent disclosed that I had killed Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, and I completely lost the middle-aged female vote. Alas, I am not cut out for politics. Why can I not just clean out the Augean stables again? As a native speaker of an extinct ancient Theban dialect, Hercules has always fared poorly during debates. His frustration with the language barrier reached a breaking point in 2003, when he angrily ripped off the head of his translator and threw it into the sky mid-debate, creating the "Bloody Head" constellation. Due to the exacting guidelines Eurystheus has laid down for the 13th labor, Hercules must run every part of the campaign himself. Consequently, he mans the phone banks and stuffs envelopes all day, breaking only for public appearances at supermarket grand openings and fun runs. "By Zeus, I would rather shoulder the burden of Atlas again than go door-to-door collecting the signatures required to get my name on the ballot," Hercules said. "People are always sitting down to sup, and they do not wish to speak to one endowed with the strength of 10 men, clad in the skin of a mighty lion. Do they not know I choked the life from a Nemean beast to obtain this majestic pelt? With the election months away, anything is possible, but early polls show Hercules trailing the incumbent Wells by a substantial margin. According to local sources, despite his many previous campaigns, the ancient candidate is still met with suspicion by the electorate. "I like where this guy stands on tightening business zoning ordinances and making Fourth Avenue a two-way street to reduce speeding in the residential areas," Greensboro voter Doug Marlon said. "But I take issue with his stance on sacking nearby cities and looting their valuables to bridge our budget shortfall. "Besides, Hercules?" he added. "That name doesn't even sound American."

17-Year-Old Thinks She's Getting Into Photography
EUGENE, OR — After wasting an afternoon taking pictures of a broken tricycle, moss on trees, and the shadow of a wrought-iron fence, Churchill Alternative High School senior Jessica Ivers falsely informed family and friends Saturday that she was getting into photography. "I love the way real film looks," said Ivers, who has owned the old single-lens reflex 35 millimeter camera for exactly one week, and named as her favorite photographers "probably Diane Arbus" and the French guy who took the picture of the boy with the wine bottle. "I'm really fascinated by textures, and I think I'll be able to get some good shots of my grandma's hands this weekend. " Sources close to Ivers expect the camera to join her clarinet and yoga mat under her bed once she pays $14.85 to develop the roll of clumsy, overexposed images.

Area Man First In His Family To Coast Through College
MINNEAPOLIS — At first glance, Daniel Peterson seems no different than any other student: Wearing a ball cap, he's spent most of the evening browsing YouTube. Soon his buddies will stop by with a six-pack, and they'll pass the time recounting exploits from their recent spring break on South Padre Island. Though his peers might take nights like this for granted, Peterson can never forget those who came before him and paved the way for his educational neglect. That's because this month the University of Minnesota senior will become the first member of his family to graduate from college without ever having to work hard, apply himself, or expend more than a bare minimum of effort. "My grandpa wasn't able to afford school until he came back from the war and got help with his tuition through the G.I. Bill," says Peterson, reclining on a futon. "He studied hard and took a job at night so he could support my grandma and dad while he finished his degree. "Listening to his stories, I promised myself that, no matter what, I would do everything in my power to take it real easy through college," Peterson adds. His father a successful engineer, his mother a dedicated social worker, this Rochester, MN native grew up dreaming of an education more painless than the one his parents had known. At 17, he received a letter of acceptance from UMN, and at that moment committed himself to five years of sleeping late, drinking often, and sneaking by with a 2.7 GPA. After scuttling plans to major in video game design, Peterson enrolled in the school's American studies program, vowing never to sign up for any class that met before 11 a.m. or required him to write a term paper over five pages. Generations of sweat, toil, and fingers worked to the bone were finally beginning to pay off. "That first semester was a challenge," Peterson admits. "As a full-time student, I had to take four classes, and I wasn't sure I'd be able to kick back and just fuck around all the time. But when I'd think about all the sacrifices my family made, I knew I had to do it. I had to do it for them. Thanks to his parents' foresight, frugal habits, and careful financial planning, Peterson has never had to worry about tuition or consider working to cover living expenses. He shows his gratitude often, stopping by his parents' house twice a month to enjoy a home-cooked meal and relax in front of the TV watching sports. "My dad worked full-time as a security guard to put himself through college, so I know how lucky I am," Peterson says. "It was his dedication and hard work that made it possible for me to spend last night playing Gears Of War with Chad instead of studying for my cinema history exam. Still, it's not all playtime for Daniel. When he's not barhopping with friends in Stadium Village, he can often be found in the back of a classroom, doodling in the margins of his notebook and attempting to display a token interest in his studies. "My father, my father's father, and all those before them — they struggled and gave it their all so I wouldn't have to," Peterson says. "Sure, I could do what everyone else my age does, studying really hard because my parents spent 20 years carefully setting aside money for my education. But I won't do that to my mom and dad. Not when I can blow off class and do just enough cramming at the end of the semester to pull a B-minus." When he's finished with school, the 23-year-old plans to continue honoring the Peterson name by living off his graduation money for a few months and then maybe temping for a while until he figures out what he wants to do next. His attitude hasn't gone unnoticed by his parents. "I don't think Daniel is taking his studies seriously," Peterson's father says. "When he comes home, I never see him crack a book. He's always out with his friends or on the Xbox. And now he's talking about maybe going to grad school. "This is everything a father could want for his son," he adds. "I am so proud.

180 Trillion Leisure Hours Lost To Work Last Year
BOSTON — According to a report released Monday by Boston University's School of Lifestyle Management, more than 180 trillion leisure hours were lost to work in 2004. "The majority of American adults find work cutting into the middle of their days — exactly when leisure is most effective," said Adam Bernhardt, the Boston University sociology professor who headed the study. "The hours between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. are ideally suited to browsing stores, dozing in front of the television, and finishing the morning paper. Daytime hours are also the warmest and sunniest of the day, making them perfect for outdoor activities. Unfortunately, most Americans can't enjoy leisure during this time, for the simple reason that they're 'at work.' In addition to surveying 12,000 citizens nationwide, researchers studied data from seven different government agencies. Deborah Kletter, an expert in the field of rest and relaxation, emphasized the pervasive nature of the problem, which she said affects 96 percent of employable Americans year-round. "Week after week of potential relaxation time is squandered to jobs, with millions of would-be leisurers prohibited from sleeping in, working on hobbies, or taking trips," said Kletter, executive director of the Five-To-Nine Foundation. "An average employed person's ability to stroll aimlessly around his town and 'do whatever' is basically nonexistent 49 weeks out of the year. Kletter said there is a vast disparity between the U.S. and Europe, where a strong leisure ethic is taught during youth. "Americans simply can't keep up with the European leisure force," Kletter said. "In such fields as suntanning, skiing, and cooking elaborate meals that can be eaten over the course of an entire evening, Europe has us beat. The report's internals reveal that full-time workers are hit hardest, with part-time workers coming in a close second, and freelancers marking a distant third. "Ironically, the unemployed fared the best in this report," Kletter said. "One of the questions that remains unanswered, unfortunately, is how jobless citizens' high number of available leisure hours somehow fails to translate into overall happiness. Bernhardt and Kletter found that employed persons do find one small but regular opportunity for leisure. "In general, Saturdays and Sundays were unaffected by work," Kletter said. "Unfortunately, this fact does little more than underscore the fact that a serious problem exists five out of seven days of the week. The loss of leisure-related revenue is another factor to consider, Kletter said. "Leisure-time reduction is costing America billions of dollars in weekday concert-ticket revenue, airfare, and violin lessons," Kletter said. "I don't understand why the government hasn't already stepped in. Kletter said that, "on the bright side," many Americans have learned to reclaim leisure time through aggressive multi-tasking. "Americans have an impressive ability to do several things at once," said Kletter, who compiled the at-office leisure figures. "Enterprising workers managed to shop online, have long-distance telephone conversations with friends, and stare at their cubicle walls for hours. Those findings are very encouraging. Bernhardt and Kletter acknowledged that their report was responsible for the loss of nearly 2,000 leisure hours.

Zip-Lining Day Trip To Somehow Save Marriage
CONCORD, NH — According to sources, the deteriorating 10-year-old marriage of Dale and Gina Byer will somehow be magically restored this weekend by a zip-lining excursion to the mountains of northern New Hampshire. The couple, trapped and suffocated by an increasingly hopeless, angst-ridden relationship, presumably booked the short getaway on the expectation that spending four hours gliding along a wire between 60-foot-tall maple trees will fully patch up the manifold emotional, sexual, and financial issues that have long been pulling them apart. "It's going to be great just the two of us out there in the woods, zipping around like a bunch of kids," Dale Byer said of the childless couple's ploy to remind themselves of whatever it was they saw in each other when they first met. "We've always talked about doing something crazy like this, and now it's finally going to happen. "I've heard it feels like you're flying," Gina added. First conceived after a vicious, 15-minute-long fight over who would walk their dog — a golden retriever purchased by the Byers in 2008 as a desperate attempt to fill the void between them — the Saturday trip will begin with a leisurely drive up I-93, two hours on the open road that will reportedly erase in one fell swoop the deepening communication gap that has plagued their relationship for years. Including gas, meals, and admission fees, the zip-lining trip will cost the couple $500 they had put aside for much-needed repairs to their home, and take up time during which Gina had hoped to work on her resumé so she can eventually leave the dead-end job that has become the second-most miserable thing in her life. "There's one section where you start on the edge of a cliff and it's 150 feet to the other side — can you believe that? " Dale said as if expecting a half-minute, high-altitude rush to suppress his almost unbearable desire to sabotage his marriage by having an affair. "And the deal they've got is fantastic, considering your ticket gets you a full day of zip-lining plus unlimited access to their rope bridges. The couple's overwhelming trust issues, disagreement over whether to have children, tendency to criticize each other's appearance, and opposing views on whether Gina's ailing parents should move in with them or reside in a nursing home will reportedly be erased by a mechanism consisting of nothing more than a cable, a slope, and a pulley. In addition, their fundamentally opposed attitudes on religion are expected to be rectified on the way home during a dinner-stop at the Applebee's off the Tilton-Northfield exit. "Apparently we have to sign in when we get to the zip-lining center, then there's a safety briefing, and then they put you on a scale to calibrate the harnesses," said Gina, ignoring the miracle that would be required for the initial weigh-in not to reignite the body-image issues that have prevented her from enjoying sexual intercourse her entire adult life. "But after you take care of all the boring stuff, that's when the real fun begins. "I can't wait to get out there," she added. Brandishing a brochure given to him by a coworker who went on the same trip years ago with her husband and is now in the final stages of legal separation, Dale pointed out that the facility has alternative activities — including an off-road safari, a tree-house tour, and an observation platform — in the event they want to take a break from zip-lining. "We'll probably be worn out by all that physical activity, so it's nice to know they have other things to do," said Dale, unconsciously acknowledging that he and his wife will inevitably blow up at each other, make a scene, and have to be removed from the course by ladder. "Who cares, though, as long as we're spending quality time together?

Area Eccentric Reads Entire Book
GREENWOOD, IN — Sitting in a quiet downtown diner, local hospital administrator Philip Meyer looks as normal and well-adjusted as can be. Yet, there's more to this 27-year-old than first meets the eye: Meyer has recently finished reading a book. Yes, the whole thing. "It was great," said the peculiar Indiana native, who, despite owning a television set and having an active social life, read every single page of To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. "Especially the way things came together for Scout in the end. Very good. Meyer, who never once jumped ahead to see what would happen and avoided skimming large passages of text in search of pictures, first began his oddball feat a week ago. Three days later, the eccentric Midwesterner was still at it, completing chapter after chapter, seemingly of his own free will. "The whole thing was really engrossing," said Meyer, referring not to a movie, video game, or competitive sports match, but rather a full-length, 288-page novel filled entirely with words. "There were days when I had a hard time putting it down. Even more bizarre, Meyer is believed to have done most of his reading during his spare time — time when the outwardly healthy and stable resident could have literally been doing anything else, be it aimlessly surfing the Internet, taking a nap, or simply just staring at his bedroom wall. "It'd be nice to read it again at some point," Meyer continued, as if that were a perfectly natural thing to say. While it's difficult to imagine what compelled Meyer to read more than just the back cover of To Kill a Mockingbird, friends and family members claim the strange behavior goes all the way back to his childhood. "I remember when Phil was a little kid, instead of picking up a book, getting bored, and then throwing it at his sister, he'd actually sit down and read the whole thing," said mother Susan Meyer, who declared she has long given up trying to explain her son's unusual hobby. "At the time, we thought it was just a phase he was going through. I guess we were wrong. Over the years, Meyer has read dozens of books from beginning to end, regardless of whether he was forced to do so by a professor in school or whether a film version of the reading material already existed. According to girlfriend Jessica Kohler, he even uses a special cardboard marking device so that he can keep track of where he has stopped reading and later return to that exact same place. "I used to find Phil's reading kind of charming because I had never really met anyone who read outside of a waiting room," Kohler said. "But more and more, it just feels odd, you know? He can't even go to the beach without bringing one of his books along. According to behavioral psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Schulz, Meyer's reading of entire books is abnormal and may be indicative of a more serious obsession with reading. "Instead of just zoning out during a bus ride or spending hour after hour watching YouTube videos at night, Mr. Meyer, unlike most healthy males, looks to books for gratification," Schulz said. "Really, it's a classic case of deviant behavior. "At least, that's what it seems like from what little I've skimmed on the topic," she added. As bizarre as it may seem, Meyer isn't alone. Once a month, he and several other Greenwood residents reportedly gather at night not only to read books all the way through, but also to discuss them at length. "I don't know, it's like this weird 'book club' they're all a part of," said Brian Cummings, a longtime coworker and friend of Meyer's. "Seriously, what a bunch of freaks.

Area Man Down To Final Week Of Heyday
CHICAGO — Following a nearly four-year period in which he was, by all accounts, living at the very peak of his existence, 26-year-old Brian Koning unknowingly entered the final 168 hours of his heyday Monday. Koning began his current halcyon days on June 23, 2005, when he moved into a loft apartment in Chicago with three old friends from high school. Since then, the Ohio University alum's daily routine has been a series of generally satisfying social interactions and life experiences that — beginning Monday at approximately 10:35 a.m. — he will forever look back upon with a pained sense of nostalgia. "I'm having a blast," Koning recently said to a friend, oblivious to the next three decades of work stress and financial responsibilities that will one day lead him to resent ever having been this happy. "Work's great, life's great, I'm going out every night — I can't imagine things being better than this. Although Koning claimed that he had a "super-tight" group of friends who would be part of his life "forever," sources reported that his two closest buddies will soon respectively enroll in a masters program at Berkeley and accept a computer programming job in Denver, causing their bonds of friendship to slowly dissolve over the next five years. According to a number of erroneous statements Koning has made in the dwindling weeks of his prime, his romantic situation also appears promising. "I really think Tracy and I might have a future together," Koning said of 27-year-old Tracy Krupman, whom he will soon marry on an emotional whim, and toward whom he will become incresingly embittered and even hateful over the next decade. "We have a real connection, and I think our best times are yet to come. "And I'm really starting to settle into Chicago," continued Koning, who in three months will be forced to move to Tacoma, WA in order to care for Krupman's ailing father. "I can totally see myself becoming one of those 'Chicago guys' who lives here for the rest of his life. I love it out here. While evidence suggests that Koning could conceivably prolong his life's pinnacle for another one or two years by leaving Krupman and following his dream of opening a trading cards and collectibles shop, the likelihood of this ever occurring is thought to be incredibly small. Koning, who currently fills his weekends with volunteer work, regular exercise, and recreational travel, will reportedly soon be granted a minor promotion that will demand all of his free time without providing any additional satisfaction. He is then expected to begin a gradual slide into unfulfilling 60-hour work weeks highlighted by the occasional halfway decent nap. "Things are finally looking up for me," Koning said in a poignantly inaccurate statement to his mother during a recent phone conversation. "All the hard stuff is behind me, and I feel like it's time to kick back and just enjoy myself. You know, really start living. While social scientists believe heydays can last anywhere from one month to several decades — and may in some cases occur intermittently — Koning's personal apex is believed to be a fluke event that has no chance of recurring. "The period of time that will come to be known as Mr. Koning's 'glory days' has actually exceeded the national average by more than six months," said Dr. Thomas Washam of the Brown University Department of Human Behavior. "Taking into account a number of variables, including the current financial markets and his father's hairline, I believe this young man should feel very lucky to have had his good run last as long as it did. Instead, he will most likely live out the rest of his life in a state of slowly mounting sadness and regret. Koning, who is currently training for an upcoming triathlon, has remained blissfully unaware of the fact that he will soon injure his left knee, leading to persistent, lifelong pain that will make it difficult for him to play with his children, who will all grow up to despise him.

Foreman Whips Up Special Batch Of Concrete For Favorite Customer
OMAHA, NE — Schultz Concrete Company foreman Al Grayson, 42, mixed up a home-made vat of his finest concrete blend Tuesday for Brenner Construction employee Charles Jacobin, after inviting his favorite customer to "follow [him] 'round back for the good stuff. " "Charlie's been coming to me for years, and I know exactly how he likes it," said Grayson, adding that his special batch isn't the kind that lasts just long enough to satisfy the inspectors but then falls apart. "This is concrete the way my grandfather made it, with just a touch of gypsum. There was only one bag left, so I tucked it away for my main man Charlie." While Grayson refused to divulge his secret recipe, he did claim to use only organic cement, artesian well water, and "enough quartzite to make any sidewalk sparkle.

Chipotle Employee Just Gave Guy In Front Of You More Rice
CHIPOTLE — In a lunchtime incident significant enough to warrant you pause, an employee at the fast food Mexican restaurant Chipotle has just dispensed to you a smaller serving of rice than the customer ahead of you. Though it appears likely the less-generous helping of rice was a simple oversight on the part of the employee, and was in no way a personal slight against you, you reportedly cannot help but think that you deserve just as much rice in your burrito as any other paying customer. Since noticing the rice disparity moments ago, you have considered a number of tactics to rectify the situation, including hesitating slightly before advancing to the beans and meat in order to convey your concern; staring intently at the other burrito in hopes of drawing attention to its incongruent size; and simply asking the Chipotle employee for a little more rice. Witnesses at the scene are currently waiting for you to move down the line. "Black beans or pinto? " the employee has just now asked you, seemingly unaware of the heaping amount of rice spilling forth from the tortilla only 18 inches to the left of yours. "Sir?" Adding to your frustration are new reports that the customer behind you has received the same amount of rice as the customer ahead of you, thereby confirming your suspicion of wrongdoing. However, if an earlier incident at the coffee shop or yesterday's conversation with your landlord are any indication, you are expected to take this lying down, like you always do. Your meek body language and resigned facial expression also suggest a high probability of inaction on your part, possibly owing to your fear of "causing a scene" in front of a bunch of strangers whom you will never see again and who would undoubtedly side with you had they seen the uneven rice distribution. A mental catalog of past Chipotle experiences currently racing through your head — including that time the woman gave you spicy salsa when you specifically asked for mild — likewise supports the belief that you are going to get screwed yet again. "Peppers and onions? " the employee has asked, your burrito moving irrevocably further from the rice station. As the opportunities for additional rice become bleaker, you have resorted to communicating your displeasure in a number of passive-aggressive ways. These include glaring at the employee when he looks away and providing somewhat curt burrito-filling instructions, such as "Chicken" and "Yes, pinto beans," in an apparent hope that your cold tone of voice will make him realize that a terrible mistake has been committed. So far, however, none of these tactics has caused the Chipotle employee to look down at the burrito next to yours, notice the startling imbalance in rice, apologize profusely, and fill your burrito accordingly. More shockingly, birth records indicate that you are a full-grown adult presumably capable of communicating your thoughts and desires to an unthreatening 19-year-old burrito-assembler. Yet you reportedly continue to avoid even the most minor confrontation, despite the ramifications it may have on your upcoming sour cream and cheese allocation. If consulted, the Chipotle employee manual would surely verify that this is a clear breach of company policy, which dictates that a scoop and a half of rice be provided to every customer regardless of age, race, or inexcusable cowardice. Therefore, all sources confirm that you should stop acting like a little bitch who allows the entire world to walk all over him and just say something already. "How's the rice today, good? " you ask in a pathetic attempt at sarcasm that draws only a slight nod from the employee and does nothing whatsoever to achieve rice equity. "Mild salsa please. No, mil — yes, that's fine. As of press time the opportunity to demand more rice is long past, and the flour tortilla has been handed off to the employee responsible for adding the final garnishes of corn, tomatoes, and — holy shit, look how much guacamole that fucking woman is getting.

Guidance Counselor Reminds Self-Mutilating Drug User About SAT Deadlines
CHICAGO — Concerned about Derek Hodge's future and his ability to ultimately succeed in life, Taft High School guidance counselor Janice Wexler warned the self-mutilating, drug-addicted student about the importance of registering for his SATs. "This is a risky game you're playing, Derek — it may not seem like a big deal now, but forgetting to sign up for the SATs could really hurt you," Wexler told the 10th-grader, who just 20 minutes earlier had hidden in the school bathroom, snorted two lines of cocaine, and cut his forearms with a razor blade in an effort to gain a sense of control. "I can't tell you the number of students I've watched go down this tragic road before. Trust me, nothing good can come out of missing the SATs." After Hodge, in a moment of candor, confessed to Wexler that he needed help, she told him not to worry and handed him a dozen informational pamphlets on "choosing the school that's right for you.

Area Man Saddened To Realize Short Jewish Women With An Interest In Theater His Type
CHICAGO — While reminiscing about his romantic past Monday, area resident David Simms was shocked and a little saddened to realize that short women belonging to the Jewish faith and possessing an active interest in the world of theater have always been, and will always be, his type. "God, how did I never notice it before? " said Simms, taken aback by his unexpected discovery. "Rachel, Sarah, Devorah — Miss Katzenberg, the weekend director at the Israeli Arts Center — it's all so obvious now. "Squat, theatergoing Jews," added Simms, shaking his head in confused wonder. "I'm totally into squat, theatergoing Jews." Simms, a 27-year-old teaching assistant and self-described "lover of all women," said he couldn't believe he hadn't made the connection sooner. Though he initially tried to dismiss it as nothing more than mere coincidence, Simms was unable to think of a single woman he had previously dated who was of above-average height or despised the works of Noël Coward. "I always just thought I liked brunettes, or was, you know, a 'breasts' man," Simms said. "It definitely explains why that thing with the Asian chemist never worked out, or why when I was in high school I had a huge crush on Rhea Perlman." "Wow, I'm going to end up marrying a tiny, artsy Jew, and that's all there is to it, huh? " Simms continued. "I'm going to fall madly in love and raise a beautiful family with a short, curly-haired theater buff. Unable to deny his physical attraction to them any longer, Simms said that all a woman needed to turn him on was to be a member of God's chosen people and struggle to reach her kitchen cupboards. In addition, Simms said that women capable of discussing Death Of A Salesman in a thick Brooklyn accent always made him lose his mind. "I can't explain it, but there's just something about a certain type of woman that really gets my juices flowing," Simms said. "Damn you, undersized ladies of the Jewish persuasion with an affinity for the theater! You drive me wild. Simms, who has dated three nasally ushers in the past nine months and once made out with a stocky divorcée at a kosher deli, said that despite his recent realization, he would still be open to giving a whole spectrum of different women a chance. As long as his date is at least half-Jewish, appreciates some form of live performance, and can be picked up off the ground with relative ease, Simms said, he would be willing to see where things go. Friends and family members said that the 27-year-old's romantic predisposition has been obvious for quite some time. Simms' father recalled how his son expressed a desire to marry the shorter, less desirable sister in Fiddler On The Roof when he was 9 years old, while longtime friend Ben Meltzer said Simms was often known to ask his peers if they ever wondered what Jackie Mason's wife looks like. "I remember a cheerleader once tried to ask David out in high school, but he turned her down cold," Meltzer said. "I'd love to tell you that I always knew that diminutive Jews were his cup of tea, but to tell you the truth, between all the play openings and musical premieres, I was convinced David was gay. Where his attraction comes from, many are still unsure. However, Simms said that the girls he has brought home have always been met with approval from his parents — especially his mother, a 4-foot, 11-inch-tall former Broadway actress who fought in Israel's war for independence.

Man Succumbs To 7-Year Battle With Health Insurance
DENVER — After years of battling crippling premiums and agonizing deductibles, local resident Michael Haige finally succumbed this week to the health insurance policy that had ravaged his adult life. Haige, who had suffered from limited medical coverage for nearly a decade, passed away early Monday morning. According to sources, the 46-year-old was laid to rest at Fairplains cemetery, surrounded by friends, family members, and more than $300,000 of mounting debt. "I miss Michael every single day, but at least he can finally rest now," said Sheila Haige, who watched as insurance rates ate away at her husband over time. "What Michael went through, the humiliating forms, the invasive background checks, the complete loss of dignity and hope — I wouldn't wish that kind of torture on anyone. Once a healthy and happy father of two, Haige saw his life forever change seven years ago when health insurance professionals diagnosed him with a preexisting condition. As months passed and his line of credit continued to deteriorate, the former high school football coach would experience excruciating headaches and bouts of nausea every time another hospital bill arrived. "My dad always seemed invincible, like there was nothing in the world that could hurt him," son Ryan Haige said. "But then, one night, I found him bent over a stack of UB-92 and HCFA forms, and he was crying. I'd never seen my father look so scared in all my life. Added Ryan, "Making those payments each month — it was killing him. While family members refused to look at Haige's insurance plan as a death sentence, it soon became clear that their loved one was facing the biggest fight of his life. Countless visits to doctors, claims adjusters, and loan officers proved futile, with Haige being told at every turn that his case was hopeless. "They said there was nothing they could do for him, that modern medicine was powerless against this monster," Sheila Haige said. "Still, Michael never gave up. He kept saying that he was going to beat the odds, that he was going to find some way to get coverage. According to an independent study released last month by the Mayo Clinic, health insurance is the nation's No. 2 cause of death, claiming the lives of some 400,000 Americans each year. A silent killer, health insurance often strikes without warning, its harmful and profit-based policies avoiding detection until it is far too late. Although the cruel bureaucratic disorder does not discriminate, statistics have shown that senior citizens, young dependents, and those woefully underemployed are most at risk. "I can't tell you the number of patients I've had to deliver the bad news to over the years," said Haige's longtime family physician, Dr. Howard Silverman. "It's never easy to look someone in the eye and tell them it's going to have to be out-of-pocket. For most of these poor people, prayer is the only hope. Toward the end of Haige's seven-year ordeal, family members said, the once loving husband and father had become an empty husk of his former self. "I remember the last thing he ever said to me," said eldest son Mark Haige, holding a small picture of his father during happier times, before the endless battery of co-pays began. "He took my hand in his, and he said, 'Son, promise me you'll never sign up for a high-deductible, network-model HMO.'" While still angry and in shock over Michael's premature passing, Sheila and her two children say the whole experience has taught them the importance of family. "If Dad were still with us, I know he would want us to be here, at home, supporting Mom," Mark Haige said. "She really hasn't been doing so well ever since Bankers Life and Casualty denied her life insurance claim.

Action Figure Fights On Despite Loss Of Dragon Sword
SETH'S BEDROOM — With the dreaded skeleton people closing in on him and the carpet suddenly turning into red-hot lava before his very eyes, local action figure Huntarr the Warrior vowed to fight on Thursday despite the loss of his cherished dragon sword. "I won't surrender! " shouted the 8-inch plastic toy, before bobbing across the bedroom floor, stopping to perform the splits for no discernable reason, and continuing on toward a nearby chair. "I'm Huntarr! You skeleton people will never make a slave out of me! "Swoosh-swoosh-swoosh," the action figure added while carrying out nearly 20 consecutive back flips. Huntarr — known for his superhuman strength, his unrelenting courage in battle, and his ability to fly and then become invisible and then turn into like a ball so that nobody can see him — has faced similar challenges in the past. Earlier this week, the action figure was confronted by an estimated 10 million sea serpents from outer space, while on Sunday, Huntarr was forced to square off against the evil mad scientist Dr. Robert Scientist. To date, the fearless warrior's greatest trial remains the time he was nearly sold at a local garage sale. That is, until the loss of his dragon sword today. "I don't have my sword, but I still have my karate," announced Huntarr, who hails from the deepest tracts of the Amazon jungle, yet is somehow versed in Eastern martial arts. "You can't stop me! I am more powerful than the most powerful man on earth, who is me. "And Seth's dad," continued the action figure, referring to certified tax accountant Howard Silverman. "He's pretty strong, too. According to sources, Huntarr battled the skeleton people for nearly 25 minutes, using a variety of kicks, violent head butts, punches that sounded very close in pitch to futuristic ray guns, a wooden spoon, and, during one covert operation fought at the kitchen table, the multiplication table for the number three. The assault is reportedly Huntarr's most vicious since he attacked a Dream Van full of defenseless Barbie dolls, some of them nude at the time. "Give up now, skeleton people, or I'll make you do your chores," the chiseled jungle warrior threatened while continuously leaping from one foot to the other to emphasize his point. "And you'll be mad because you're tired and you don't like cleaning up! Responding to the threat of having to make the bed, the leader of the skeleton people finally admitted defeat Thursday. "Please stop — I think you broke my head," cried the skeleton leader, slowly raising both arms, the left arm with some difficulty, in a show of surrender. "Let's be friends! I want to be friends! After a few seconds of deliberation, Huntarr reportedly agreed to a pact with his longtime foe, though he stated that by becoming friends, the leader of the skeleton people had to pick him first at dodgeball from now on, and couldn't tease him anymore about the time he threw up during recess. Also, Huntarr said, the leader of the skeleton people had to let the brazen warrior play with his toys when he brought them to school. "I saved the earth! " cried the victorious action figure. "Let's eat cheese pizza now! As of press time, Huntarr had once again won out over the forces of evil, and after collecting a handsome reward of $5, rested facedown on the ground, where many speculate he will remain until early tomorrow morning.

Mattress King Selects Wife From Small Wisconsin Village
OSHKOSH, WI — Joyous tidings were trumpeted throughout the hamlets of central Wisconsin this week after 43-year-old Mattress King James Koepke III, Lord and Master of a vast bed and box-spring empire, selected Beth Lowery, a buxom, flaxen-haired maiden from the small village of Waukau, to be his bride. The 36-year-old queen-to-be, red of cheek and unmarred by pocks or the great widening of the hindquarters endemic to females of the region, reportedly accepted the king's matrimonial offer without hesitation. The new queen will reign alongside the noble bedroom furnishings monarch, and together they shall rule the mattress kingdom, which spreads across four convenient locations in the Fox River Valley. Following the royal proclamation, the Mattress King and his retinue reportedly celebrated with great relish amongst the citizenry at Tinker's Pub, where Wild Turkey and Miller High Life did freely flow until the early morning hours. "I'm real happy for [King] Jimmy," said James' most trusted consul since high school, Sir Louis of Wilkinson. "This new one seems like a great gal. All's I gotta say is, it's about time! James III — the territory's unchallenged sovereign of discount prices on Sealy, Serta, King Koil, and Tempur-Pedic mattresses since his father, James II, became too enfeebled to run the empire in 1999 — has been in search of a suitable queen ever since his last bride, Linda, the Great Bitch of Pewaukee, absconded in the night with a lowborn scoundrel from whom she was taking skiing lessons. Though she was banished from James' sprawling split-level Oshkosh palace in 2002, the former queen was able to empty his vast coffers by half, leaving the Mattress King much embittered by romantic conquest for many years. Sources close to the king said that he remained most dubious about his prospects of ever again finding true love until he was instantly smitten by the fair and reasonably chaste Beth of Waukau, a common serving wench at a local Applebee's. In his great languishing for his beloved, the Mattress King reportedly could not rest his mighty head in slumber for nigh a fortnight, and supped at the simple chain tavern every day for a month, walking amongst his subjects as one of their own. At last, no longer able to contain his desire, His Highness summoned the courage to request that he be permitted to court her in the customary manner with an evening of bowling. Though he cared for her deeply, King James at first did hide his noble birthright from Lowery, afraid that his lady love was indeed one of a roving pack of money grubbing whores that had befallen the area. "I think Jimmy didn't tell her who he was because he got burned so many times in the past," said Kyle Osterberg, trusted ward of the king's fiefdom in Appleton's Fox River Mall. "He wanted Beth to love him for who he is as a person. According to sources, the dirty-flaxen-haired Lowery finally discovered the king's true identity after seeing him in all his regal dress on a printed edict on the back of the Oshkosh Northwestern newspaper. In the full-color announcement, His Majesty declared himself insane due to the unheard-of discounts he was offering on all Simmons mattresses throughout his kingdom. Soon after, the Mattress King asked for her hand, paying a handsome tribute to her parents in the form of a 25-percent lifetime discount at any of the franchises under his purview. "Jimmy is such a great guy, and so much better than the other jerks Beth was always dragging home," said Melinda Lowery, the future Mattress Queen's mother, clearly still in awe of her daughter's unimaginable providence. "And [the queen's father] Clark [Lowery] and I just love our new mattress set. Though the benefits of mattress royalty will be many, the new queen will not be without her sacred duties. From the day their union is formed, Lowery will be at her husband's side in the back office of the North Main Street location, where her most important charge will be balancing the royal checkbook, because, according to the king's decree, "she's got a great head for numbers. The Mattress King and his betrothed will reportedly be wed this May, with a lavish reception for the local peasantry to be held at the Delmar Party House. Sources said that no expense will be spared for the wedding feast, where local delicacies will abound, including innumerable hot wings from Purcell's Bar & Grille. The queen is expected to produce an heir to the throne in six and a half months.

Area Man Committed To Being Spicy Food Guy
NEWTON, KS — Auto salesman Royce Flankingston — known to frequently question waitstaff as to whether or not food is "actually" spicy, always ordering the spiciest dish on any menu, and then complaining that it is not spicy enough — recently renewed his commitment to being the spicy food aficionado in his group of friends. "Jalapeños, habañeros, those are some weak-sauce peppers, man — you got anything spicy in that salsa? " Flankingston asked his fellow Chrysler dealership employees at a company picnic last weekend, to which he brought his own sampler selection of hot sauces and dared everyone present to try them. "The famous asbestos Flankingston tongue doesn't notice anything under 10,000 Scoville units, so spare me that Heinz ketchup stuff, okay, buds? " Those close to Flankingston said that, while obnoxious, his latest obsession isn't half as bad as when he attempted to be the small-batch bourbon guy.

Area Man Thought He Had More Forks Than This
CHARLOTTE, NC — Rummaging through his silverware tray Thursday morning, database administrator Ben Pagano, 30, was shocked to discover that he owned far fewer forks than previously assumed. "What the hell? I thought I had a bunch of them," Pagano said after double-checking the tray's knife compartment and his bedroom nightstand for any wayward forks. "Didn't I have, like, six when I moved in here? I wonder if Bill took some when he moved out. " At press time, 11 of Pagano's forks and his missing wristwatch were still in the apartment's broken dishwasher, which none of the roommates had opened since April.

Kidnapped Boy Found Safe, Imagines Kidnapped Boy
MENA, AR — After an extensive three-month-long search, the Polk County Sheriff's Department located missing 9-year-old Joshua Meyers in an abandoned home, rescued the child from his captors, and returned him to his loving parents, the still bound and gagged boy imagined Tuesday. According to the kidnapped child's imagination, Meyers was liberated from his abductors when 30 law enforcement agents swooped down from helicopters, crashed through the windows of the basement where he was being kept, and carried the desperate third-grader away to safety. Blocking out the sight and stench of his surroundings, the boy's imagination went on to report that Meyers was led by authorities into the arms of his overjoyed parents — a complete fantasy the 9-year-old was somehow able to conjure up despite the fact that he was lying face down on a filthy concrete floor, his arms and legs restrained by rope. "I'm so happy to be free," said a delirious Meyers, the sound of his voice muffled by the sock stuffed deep inside his mouth. "I knew my Mom and Dad would never stop looking for me. I knew they would find me." "They said everything is going to be all better now," continued Meyers, disregarding strict orders from his captors to quiet down and stop moaning. "And that nothing like what happened back there will ever happen to me again." In his weak and weary mind, Meyers was then swaddled in a warm blanket, placed in the front seat of the sheriff's car, and served hot chocolate with both marshmallows and whipped cream. Emergency medical technicians, envisioned by the shivering, emaciated child, reportedly examined Meyers' injuries and determined that they were not life threatening and would not leave any physical or emotional scars. "It's over!" the kidnapped child said, his sudden exclamation sending several large rats scurrying from between his feet. Following his fictitious rescue, the 9-year-old boy was driven to the Supreme Court, where he pointed out his abductors, sentenced them to a million years in jail, and was rewarded with a brand new bike for all he had been through. According to Meyers' vivid imagination, he also received a formal apology from his captors, who admitted that they should never have dragged the boy away from his mother, blindfolded him in the trunk of their car, or told him that they were going to kill his dog if he didn't cooperate. "We are bad men and we know that what we did was wrong, but we were afraid Joshua would beat us up if we untied him," said Ed Jackson, a mental composite of the three men currently keeping watch over the severely dehydrated and hallucinating child. "Sorry, Josh. Maybe you'd feel better if we gave you the gazillion dollars we took from your parents." "And the little pinkie finger you miss so much," he added. Meyers' imagination, once used to play with his G.I. Joe action figures, then conjured up one last fleeting daydream, in which the boy, seated at the dinner table, was surrounded by his mother and father, his little brother Henry, and a warm viscous fluid that kept running out of his mouth.

Dog Finds Absolutely Perfect Place To Shit
PORTLAND, OR — After carefully examining every inch of sidewalk within a four block radius of his home Tuesday, local dog Sigmund, 4, finally found the absolutely perfect place to squat down on his hind legs and void his bowels. The Labrador retriever mix — who bypassed a series of nearly perfect spots to deposit his feces — scanned the ground for a full seven minutes before eventually locating the 4-by-5-inch region that exhibited an ideal synthesis of ground texture, smell, and plant-life proximity. Sigmund then carefully strained out two and one quarter lengths of excrement onto the ideal site, approximately 11 inches from the curb and 4 inches from a street sign soaked in another dog's urine. This marked Sigmund's most successful location hunt today, surpassing an earlier incident in which the dog found a pretty okay place to vomit.

I'm Not One Of Those 'Love Thy Neighbor' Christians
Everybody has this image of "crazy Christians" based on what they hear in the media, but it's just not true. Most Christians are normal, decent folks. We don't all blindly follow a bunch of outdated biblical tenets or go all fanatical about every bit of dogma. What I'm trying to say is, don't let the actions of a vocal few color your perceptions about what the majority of us are like. Like me. I may be a Christian, but it's not like I'm one of those wacko "love your neighbor as yourself " types. God forbid! I'm here to tell you there are lots of Christians who aren't anything like the preconceived notions you may have. We're not all into "turning the other cheek. " We don't spend our days committing random acts of kindness for no credit. And although we believe that the moral precepts in the Book of Leviticus are the infallible word of God, it doesn't mean we're all obsessed with extremist notions like "righteousness" and "justice." My faith in the Lord is about the pure, simple values: raising children right, saying grace at the table, strictly forbidding those who are Methodists or Presbyterians from receiving communion because their beliefs are heresies, and curing homosexuals. That's all. Just the core beliefs. You won't see me going on some frothy-mouthed tirade about being a comfort to the downtrodden. I'm a normal Midwestern housewife. I believe in the basic teachings of the Bible and the church. Divorce is forbidden. A woman is to be an obedient subordinate to the male head of the household. If a man lieth down with another man, they shall be taken out and killed. Things everybody can agree on, like the miracle of glossolalia that occurred during Pentecost, when the Apostles were visited by the Holy Spirit, who took the form of cloven tongues of fire hovering just above their heads. You know, basic common sense stuff. But that doesn't mean I think people should, like, forgive the sins of those who trespass against them or anything weird like that. We're not all "Jesus Freaks" who run around screaming about how everyone should "Judge not lest ye be judged," whine "Blessed are the meek" all the time, or drone on and on about how we're all equal in the eyes of God! Some of us are just trying to be good, honest folks who believe the unbaptized will roam the Earth for ages without the comfort of God's love when Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior returns on Judgment Day to whisk the righteous off to heaven. Now, granted, there are some Christians on the lunatic fringe who take their beliefs a little too far. Take my coworker Karen, for example. She's way off the deep end when it comes to religion: going down to the homeless shelter to volunteer once a month, donating money to the poor, visiting elderly shut-ins with the Meals on Wheels program — you name it! But believe me, we're not all that way. The people in my church, for the most part, are perfectly ordinary Americans like you and me. They believe in the simple old-fashioned traditions — Christmas, Easter, the slow and deliberate takeover of more and more county school boards to get the political power necessary to ban evolution from textbooks statewide. That sort of thing. We oppose gay marriage as an abomination against the laws of God and America, we're against gun control, and we fervently and unwaveringly believe that the Jews, Muslims, and all on earth who are not born-again Pentecostalists are possessed by Satan and should be treated as such. When it comes down to it, all we want is to see every single member of the human race convert to our religion or else be condemned by a jealous and wrathful God to suffer an eternity of agony and torture in the Lake of Fire! I hope I've helped set the record straight, and I wish you all a very nice day! God bless you! Janet Cosgrove

Hero Woman Changes In Front Of Open Window
NEW YORK — Local heroine Emily, the smokin' hot neighbor lady from across the street, reportedly went above and beyond the call of duty Monday by selflessly changing her clothes within full view of her bedroom window. Sources said the humble woman — whose last name remains a mystery as no one has yet summoned the courage to speak to her — did not accept any praise for her heroic act, nor did she mention her altruistic stripping to anyone afterward. But her sacrifice that evening will not soon be forgotten, as her fearless nakedness inspired dozens of passersby and saved the neighborhood from a debilitating drought of T&A; sightings. "I never thought I'd see this day," said Juan Ramirez, 23, one of countless local residents who said they owed the gallant Emily more than they could ever repay. "You could see everything. Everything. Thank God she happened to be there, naked. Displaying what eyewitnesses described as "enormous" bravery, an incredible rack, blond pubic hair, and a stalwart willingness to put others' needs before her own, the amazing woman reportedly pulled off a very tight sweater, paused to brush her long, flowing hair, and then reached with both hands behind her back to unfasten her bra. In an impressive act of charity and goodwill, she then proceeded to remove her pants and underwear — slowly, and with great care — before changing into a different outfit, thereby gaining status as a true hero to anyone within 150 feet of her window. The heroic woman's nude form was reportedly visible for 35 to 40 heart-stopping seconds, and, according to sources, she never once wavered in the completion of her valiant act despite the chilly February air. Although she did not reappear at the window for the remainder of the evening, nearby residents said Emily had already done far more for them than anyone could have expected, momentarily uniting the entire neighborhood in an unprecedented outpouring of private appreciation for her gracious nipple exposure. "She is a true example of just how generous a human being can be," said Jim Petersen, 32, who lives two houses down from his new idol. "I think I speak for everyone huddled here tonight when I say I'll never forget what that benevolent woman did for us. According to local sources, this one topless sacrifice has saved the entire block from the Emily's-naked-body deprivation that has haunted the area since she first moved in June 2007. After more than 18 excruciating months of drawn curtains, fears had begun to mount that the hypnotic curves of her glorious body might never be glimpsed by anyone in the vicinity. "When I first saw her moving into the building, bending over to pick up cardboard box after cardboard box, I knew it was going to get bad," said neighbor Tommy Riordan, 35. "She had this tank top on, and cutoff — I don't even want to go into it. But it was clear that the whole block would be facing a major crisis from that moment on. With no relief in sight, tension reportedly reached a breaking point last Saturday, when Emily answered the buzzer of her building and signed for a package wearing a terry-cloth robe. However, just when all seemed lost, sources said, she surprised everyone by removing not only her clothing, but also the neighborhood's heavy burden of half-formed naked-Emily fantasies. "I didn't think we'd ever see all that pain and suffering alleviated, but God bless her, she did it," said Riordan, closing his eyes to remember the triumphant moment all over again. "She did it! " he added with a cheer. Though those most affected by her altruism said her fortitude and mettle deserves a showering of praise, the self-effacing Emily was too modest to take credit for her daring act. "I just got home, changed out of my work clothes, and then went to the deli," the humble hero said. "I don't understand why everyone's treating me like some kind of saint. "Who are you people? " she added. "Stop looking at me like that.

Area Teen Accidentally Enters Teen Center
SANDUSKY, OH — In a moment of confusion, area teenager Eric Dooley briefly walked into a local teen outreach center Tuesday, a place that neither he nor any of his teenaged friends would ever knowingly enter. "Oh, geez. I'm sorry," the 15-year-old said as he quickly assessed the four battered foosball tables, outdated PlayStation console, overly friendly counselor, and garish orange and purple paint scheme — all intended to appeal to him — before exiting the facility in less than six seconds. "This isn't where I'm supposed to be. Sorry. Sorry." Dooley reportedly joined a gang later that afternoon.

Grissett also confirmed that he can move it like this, and like this, but when he tries to move it like this, ah fuck. He added, "This happened once last August, the same thing. It's probably nothing. " At press time, it has swelled up to the size of a cantaloupe.

Co-Op Casino Robbed Again
ANN ARBOR, MI — The member-owned-and-operated casino known as the Sunshine & Sharing Gaming Cooperative was robbed Tuesday for the fourth time this month, with more than $250,000 reportedly being stolen from the democratically run gambling house's main vault. Although police are currently going down the list of the casino's members, all of whom have access to the safe for one weekend each month, in hopes of catching a break in the case, it is still unknown who was on cash-pile-guarding duty at the time of the robbery. "They even took the wicker basket we keep the money in," said a casino member and 1/360th-part owner known as "Stuef." "This is not my fault, okay, guys? I switched guard shifts with Petula two weeks ago. I even drew arrows on the sign-up calendar and everything. " Thus far, no firings have been made or even suggested, but the casino's members have agreed to beef up oversight measures by replacing the position of casino pit boss with a 15-person pit coordinating committee.

Closing Of Homeless Shelter Leaves College-Application-Padding Students With Nowhere To Turn
NEW YORK — After years of providing hope and assistance to resume-padding volunteers, the Second District Homeless Shelter closed its doors this week, leaving hundreds of desperate students without anything to write under "Other Interests." The shelter, long a place of refuge for those in need of extracurricular credit, was shut down Monday due to statewide budget cutbacks and a drop-off in private donations. According to sources, the news has devastated countless high school seniors who had come to depend on the outreach center in order to impress prospective colleges. "Where am I supposed to go now? " said 17-year-old Jeremy Krassner, one of many B-plus students left to wonder about his future. "Princeton only takes the very best candidates, and even schools like Columbia check for community-service experience. Added Krassner, "I'll never make it. Krassner is not alone. Over the years, the temporary housing facility has turned a number of academic lives around and provided many young men and women with a second chance at graduating with honors. In addition, the homeless shelter has reportedly supplied college applicants with a safe, inviting place to improve their transcripts, allowing them to escape the dangers of having to clean up inner-city neighborhoods or commit to other risky volunteer activities. Since the shelter's closing, however, students from all walks of life have found it difficult to carry on. "With the shelter, I never had to worry about where my next scholastic achievement was going to come from," Townsend High School student body president Jessica Glustein said. "Now that it's gone, what chance does someone like me have of composing an admissions essay that touts my active involvement in community-based projects? While some down-and-out volunteers have managed to find temporary salvation at an understaffed food bank one town over, others haven't been so lucky. Michael King, a sophomore at Rye Country Day School, said that unless things change for the better, he might soon find himself in the hospital — as he recently heard they have openings for candy stripers in the geriatric wing. But as desperation grows, a number of students have taken more drastic measures, with some resorting to begging for signatures on the streets in hopes of securing even the smallest $6,000 annually renewable scholarship. "I just stand on the corner here, and whenever someone walks by, I ask if they have a couple of minutes to help save the environment," said Rebbeca Hodge, who signed up to volunteer with Greenpeace on Tuesday. "Most people just ignore me or pretend like I don't exist. It's degrading. Nobody should have to go through this. "I've managed to get by okay thanks to a Habitat for Humanity home I've been helping to build," Joshua Penderman, 16, said. "But what happens to me and my dreams of going to Dartmouth when the winter comes? What will I do when it gets too cold to participate in charity car washes or plant trees at the nursing home? Statistics culled from five major metropolitan areas over the last 10 years suggest this trend shows no signs of stopping. In 2005, a free health clinic, which had for years allowed Chicago-area students to strengthen their applications to med school, was shut down without warning. And just last year the closing of an assisted-living residence in Baltimore left dozens of volunteers without the academic support they so desperately required. According to social worker Elizabeth Schulz, the shuttering of the Second District Homeless Shelter has done more than just jeopardize the scholastic lives of its student volunteers. "Yes, this will hurt young men and women looking to improve their school transcripts, but we're avoiding the real issue here," Schulz said. "What about people, like me, who need outreach programs in order to build up their roster of private, government-subsidized clients? How are we supposed to eat?

Class Of '88 Reunion Attendees Once Again Trick Sue Thorpe Into Thinking Jeff Urban Likes Her
ABERDEEN, ID — While attending her 20-year high school reunion Monday, 38-year-old claims adjuster Sue Thorpe was once again tricked into believing that used-car salesman and former homecoming king Jeff Urban had a crush on her, a replay of a cruel prank first played on Thorpe during her senior prom in 1988. "Becky [Linden] told me that Jeff was real lonely after his divorce, and that he had thought about me a lot over the years," Thorpe said tearfully after being humiliated in front of her entire class when the now 252-pound Urban refused to dance with her. "And Bella [Cortland] said that because Jeff's a notary public now, it's illegal for him to lie, so he had to be telling the truth when she asked Jeff if he liked me and he said yes. Why do they keep doing this to me? " Later that evening, a dejected Thorpe repeated another dark chapter from her past when she got drunk and was impregnated by Louis O'Keefe in a soccer goal.

T.G.I. Friday's Executive Chef Recommends Booze-On-Meat-With-Cheese Thing
SCHAUMBURG, IL — The executive chef of the Tremont Road T.G.I. Friday's strongly recommended that a table of VIP guests try the evening's special: a "tender, juicy, and heavily seasoned" booze-on-meat-with-cheese thing. "Tonight's special is a succulent 8-ounce meat, infused with imported cheese and drizzled with a creamy reduction of booze," said chef Tom Pinelli, adding that the entrée is served on a bed of cheese and meat, and is best paired with a glass of booze. "However, if you're in the mood for something a little lighter, we do have a refreshing selection of sauce-on-fish-on-stick stuff, as well as some healthier cheese-filled-meat-under-bacon options. " For vegetarian diners, Pinelli recommended the 56-ounce fried mushroom.

Area Grandmother Tries Indian Food
BLOOMINGTON, MN — Characterizing the experience as "different," local grandmother Eileen Rutherford, 78, ate Indian food for the first time Saturday. Although Rutherford was initially reluctant to try the cuisine, she was persuaded by her visiting grandchildren Melissa, Brandon, and Allison, who told the septuagenarian she needed to "expand her horizons. "I couldn't believe that she had lived through three wars and the Great Depression and never even tasted Indian food once," said Rutherford's eldest grandchild Melissa, 22. "I was like, 'Grandma, you've got to try it. It's so good.' Brandon, 19, made further entreaties, convincing a skeptical Rutherford that Indian food "has lots of sauces, sort of like spaghetti sauce" and repeatedly assuring her that she would like the bread. After Rutherford's offer to instead make cold-cut sandwiches for everyone was rebuffed, she relented and accompanied her grandchildren to the nearby Bombay Delights restaurant. "She only lives two blocks from the place, but she never went in there," Allison, 20, said. "That's just sad. According to Melissa, upon entering Bombay Delights, Rutherford seemed apprehensive about the restaurant's Hindu-themed décor, sitar music, and Indian people. Rutherford did, however, offer a positive comment on the table's elegantly arranged red linen napkins, saying, "These napkins are very nice. Rutherford's attempt to order food was mired by several setbacks, including a struggle to locate her reading glasses and an assertion that she did not know what anything on the menu meant. Despite Allison's best efforts to explain that the entrée selections were clearly divided into sections by types of meats, seafood, and vegetables, Rutherford encouraged her grandchildren to "go ahead and order" for her. Witnesses reported that Rutherford seemed overwhelmed by the unusual aromas upon receiving her first course. She appeared delighted, however, after she cut into the deep-fried pastry shell of a samosa and a recognizable pea rolled out. Rutherford went on to talk about peas for 15 minutes, including an anecdote about how she enjoyed shelling peas from their pods when she was a little girl. "It's cool that we were able to get Grandma to experience a whole new set of flavors and textures," said Brandon, adding that it was gratifying to see his grandmother sample coconut chutney and dum aloo vindaloo. "Now that she's tasted Indian food, I wouldn't be surprised if she starts coming here all the time. "And the look of awe on her face when they brought out the fluffy poori bread was so cute," he added. "When we deflated it with a fork, she just smiled. Rutherford's grandchildren said the highlight of the evening was watching in giddy anticipation as Rutherford took her first bite of the main course, an authentic goat curry dish. According to Brandon, Rutherford raised her eyebrows slightly, silently nodded several times, then took a sip of water. For the remainder of the meal, Rutherford, who had never consumed goat meat before, ate primarily rice and plain naan. In a statement given after the meal, Rutherford described the entrée as "just a little too flavorful. "They put an awful lot of spices in there," said Rutherford, adding that she liked the sweetened "little ball things" they had for dessert. "It was very unusual. Following the completion of the meal, the Bombay Delights waiter asked Rutherford how her food was, to which she responded that it was "nice to spend time with [her] grandchildren. After leaving the restaurant, Rutherford returned home, made herself comfortable in her favorite chair, covered herself with a blanket, and ate tuna straight from the can.

Dinner Theater Play Reworked To Push Chicken Special
AKRON, OH — The Footlight Dinner Theater's weekend production of Death Of A Salesman featured partially rewritten dialogue apparently intended to highlight the restaurant's $11.99 chicken dinner special, sources reported Wednesday. "He's liked, but he's not well liked. Unlike that delicious rosemary chicken with fresh green peas and mashed potatoes, which everyone loves," the actor portraying Biff Loman said as part of the revised play. The last time the Footlight altered a legendary theatrical work to advertise a food item was in October 2006, when manager Harold Childress rewrote the lyrics to a song from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and changed its title to "What's The Use Of Wond'rin'? (Just Get The Lasagna)."

Phantom Diner Appears Only To Those In Their Drunkest Hour
ROCHESTER, NY — Reported sightings of Rochester's legendary "phantom diner," a mysterious restaurant that purportedly appears only to those in the most inebriated state of their lives, are often met with skepticism and incredulity. But for Leo Kline, 24, who claims he visited the diner this past weekend, the apparitional eatery is all too real. "I had all but given up hope that I would get to eat pancakes and sausage that night," said Kline, who was separated from his group of friends early Sunday morning after leaving the Steel Toe Bar's nickel-beer night to urinate in an alleyway. "Then all of a sudden, there it was in front of me, bathed in this unnatural neon light. I don't remember much after that, but when I woke up the next day in the back of [Rick] Loomis' pickup truck, there was syrup in my hair. "That's when I knew the whole thing wasn't just a dream," Kline added. These strange encounters with the enigmatic restaurant — described by hundreds of inebriated witnesses since 1990 — generally occur between the hours of midnight and 4 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday mornings, as well as on Mondays during three-day weekends. The majority of hungover witnesses mention aimlessly wandering the streets and feeling insatiable hunger and extreme disorientation before catching a glimpse of the mysterious restaurant and being drawn irresistibly toward it. The memory loss associated with eating at the phantasmic diner, however, has left a dearth of concrete descriptions. Most, including bicycle-shop manager Corey Richmond, 27, could not even recall the general area in which the eatery had appeared to them. "I thought maybe it was on Lyle Avenue, but I've been to that part of town dozens of times before," Richmond said. "The neighborhood is barren and completely run-down. There's nothing over there except for boarded-up buildings, that shitty Greek joint, and check-cashing places. Vague accounts of the diner's interior have offered little insight into the mystery. Some mention an ancient, spectral waitstaff and indescribable bathroom conditions, and a few recall being forcibly ejected by a furious, massive blur that told them in a deep voice to "stay the fuck out. Even those who have allegedly visited the elusive restaurant disagree as to what state a person must be in to see the diner. Many say it appears after the consumption of 12 beers, while others insist 13 are required, which must be imbibed through a funnel. A smaller contingency adamantly contends that one must combine Jägermeister and white wine at a Valentine's Day mixer in order to summon the fantastical eatery. All agree, however, that the restaurant uncannily appears after no fewer than nine incantations of "Dude, I am so fucking wasted. Rochester's phantom diner is not the only case of a mysterious food establishment appearing exclusively to the exceedingly drunk. According to Dr. Thomas Paup, a leading expert on alcohol-contingent restaurant apparitions, there have been many similar phenomena across the country. "The most famous example, of course, is the Normandy Avenue fish-taco truck in Los Angeles," Paup said. "But there have been many others, including a Middle Eastern restaurant in Denver and a churro stand in Austin, TX. In fact, you would be hard-pressed to find an area with a centralized bar scene where these types of reports haven't surfaced. "The factor that seems to tie all of these cases together is that each subject has been drunker than at any point in his or her entire life and in dire need of greasy, disgusting food," Paup continued. Though many doubt the veracity of the confusing, fragmented stories that stem from so-called "crypto-eateries," those who say the phantom diner has appeared to them remain convinced of the partially remembered events that took place there. "I'm pretty sure I left my cell phone there when I was throwing up in the bathroom, and when I went there the next day, it was gone," said 26-year-old temp worker Rebecca Porter. "How do you explain that?

Closing Of Homeless Shelter Leaves College-Application-Padding Students With Nowhere To Turn
NEW YORK — After years of providing hope and assistance to resume-padding volunteers, the Second District Homeless Shelter closed its doors this week, leaving hundreds of desperate students without anything to write under "Other Interests." The shelter, long a place of refuge for those in need of extracurricular credit, was shut down Monday due to statewide budget cutbacks and a drop-off in private donations. According to sources, the news has devastated countless high school seniors who had come to depend on the outreach center in order to impress prospective colleges. "Where am I supposed to go now? " said 17-year-old Jeremy Krassner, one of many B-plus students left to wonder about his future. "Princeton only takes the very best candidates, and even schools like Columbia check for community-service experience. Added Krassner, "I'll never make it. Krassner is not alone. Over the years, the temporary housing facility has turned a number of academic lives around and provided many young men and women with a second chance at graduating with honors. In addition, the homeless shelter has reportedly supplied college applicants with a safe, inviting place to improve their transcripts, allowing them to escape the dangers of having to clean up inner-city neighborhoods or commit to other risky volunteer activities. Since the shelter's closing, however, students from all walks of life have found it difficult to carry on. "With the shelter, I never had to worry about where my next scholastic achievement was going to come from," Townsend High School student body president Jessica Glustein said. "Now that it's gone, what chance does someone like me have of composing an admissions essay that touts my active involvement in community-based projects? While some down-and-out volunteers have managed to find temporary salvation at an understaffed food bank one town over, others haven't been so lucky. Michael King, a sophomore at Rye Country Day School, said that unless things change for the better, he might soon find himself in the hospital — as he recently heard they have openings for candy stripers in the geriatric wing. But as desperation grows, a number of students have taken more drastic measures, with some resorting to begging for signatures on the streets in hopes of securing even the smallest $6,000 annually renewable scholarship. "I just stand on the corner here, and whenever someone walks by, I ask if they have a couple of minutes to help save the environment," said Rebbeca Hodge, who signed up to volunteer with Greenpeace on Tuesday. "Most people just ignore me or pretend like I don't exist. It's degrading. Nobody should have to go through this. "I've managed to get by okay thanks to a Habitat for Humanity home I've been helping to build," Joshua Penderman, 16, said. "But what happens to me and my dreams of going to Dartmouth when the winter comes? What will I do when it gets too cold to participate in charity car washes or plant trees at the nursing home? Statistics culled from five major metropolitan areas over the last 10 years suggest this trend shows no signs of stopping. In 2005, a free health clinic, which had for years allowed Chicago-area students to strengthen their applications to med school, was shut down without warning. And just last year the closing of an assisted-living residence in Baltimore left dozens of volunteers without the academic support they so desperately required. According to social worker Elizabeth Schulz, the shuttering of the Second District Homeless Shelter has done more than just jeopardize the scholastic lives of its student volunteers. "Yes, this will hurt young men and women looking to improve their school transcripts, but we're avoiding the real issue here," Schulz said. "What about people, like me, who need outreach programs in order to build up their roster of private, government-subsidized clients? How are we supposed to eat?

Queen Elizabeth II Announces She's Pregnant Again
LONDON — Citizens from Northumberland to Hampshire are buzzing with excitement as Queen Elizabeth II, 82, formally announced that she is expecting the arrival of another baby, just 532 months after giving birth to Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The British monarch and her consort, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, 87, confirmed rumors Tuesday that the queen recently entered her second trimester, and that a little Baron or Baroness of Renfrew is on the way. England's royal couple, who were married in 1947, said they were "absolutely delighted" to be having their first child in more than four decades. "I'm so thrilled to be pregnant again," said Queen Elizabeth II, who gave birth to her first son shortly after Great Britain granted India its independence. "Prince Philip and I have wanted this for many, many years. The entire United Kingdom has been blessed by this tiny little miracle." The queen, modeling her maternity robe of state and pulling it tightly around her waist to show off the slight bulge of the fetus growing inside her, claimed that she initially wore loose- fitting ceremonial gowns to hide her expanding belly and swollen breasts from the public. This past weekend, Queen Elizabeth invited her four middle-aged children to Windsor Castle to privately inform them that they were going to have a younger brother or sister. The glowing octogenarian, whose eyes sparkled through her cataracts, said she repeatedly assured her 59-year-old son, Prince Charles, that he was still special and that the baby would not replace him as the heir apparent to the crown. Her Majesty then met with her eight grandchildren and explained that she would need them to be extra-helpful around the palace when their little aunt or uncle was born. "The looks on their faces when I told them I could feel the baby kicking were simply priceless," said the radiant queen, who reportedly invited her grandchildren to feel her stomach. All politely declined. In preparation for the new addition to the royal family, Queen Elizabeth has instructed her staff to convert the State Room of Buckingham Palace into a nursery, retrieved her old breast pump from the basement of Windsor Castle, and assembled a baby throne. The queen also located an old journal containing a list of her favorite baby names, which she wrote down just six weeks before Britain entered World War II. "I believe if I have a girl, I shall give her a pretty name such as Amberjill, Erline, or Cleva," Queen Elizabeth said. "However, if it is a boy, he will be both child of and father to all Britons and therefore will need a dignified name such as Blaxton, Dalbert, Arkwright, or Egerton." Although nearly half a century has passed since the queen gave birth to her youngest son, she has insisted that she will raise her new baby using traditional child-rearing methods, including breastfeeding and administering a daily decoction of sarsaparilla for whooping cough. Immediately after birth, the newborn will be expected to oversee the counties of Cornwall and Wiltshire, as well as appoint the next Archbishop of Canterbury. Many British elite, including Margaret Thatcher and Prime Minister Gordon Brown, offered their congratulations to the queen, saying they were "extremely happy" and "somewhat surprised" to hear the news. Some citizens could barely put their excitement into words. "Oh my God," Manchester native Dominick Martin said. "When did this happen?" While no announcements have been made regarding a baby shower, the queen will travel to each of her realms outside the United Kingdom over the next two months to allow her subjects a chance to celebrate her unborn child with colorful floats and processions. Upon returning home, Queen Elizabeth is scheduled to tour the English countryside, host a concert in which guitarist Brian May plays "Rock-A-Bye Baby" on the roof of Buckingham Palace, and suffer a massive stroke. In other royal news, recently hired Windsor Castle gardener Diego Marquez, 24, was unexpectedly elevated to Duke of Leinster during a private ceremony Monday.

Miracle Of Birth Occurs For 83 Billionth Time
HOPE SPRINGS, AR — The holy and sacrosanct miracle of birth, long revered by human civilization as the most mysterious and magical of all phenomena, took place for what experts are estimating "must be at least the 83 billionth time" Tuesday with the successful delivery of eight-pound, four-ounce baby boy Darryl Brandon Severson at Holy Mary Mother Of God Hospital. The milestone was achieved by Carla Severson, 32, an unemployed cosmetology-school graduate and homemaker, and her husband of 14 years, Dwayne Severson, also 32, a former screen-door factory worker and freelance lawncare contractor. Experts say the miracle most likely was the result of the pair engaging in an otherwise routine act of sexual intercourse at some point during late May 1998. The miraculous birth is the couple's fifth. "This truly is a miracle," said OB-GYN floor nurse Sandra Meese, placing Darryl Brandon in the New Births Room of the hospital's maternity ward, where he joined 32 other equally miraculous babies. "Looking down into this precious child's red, screaming face, so barely distinguishable from all the other wailing children surrounding him on all sides, one is reminded of just how special and unique the gift of life really is. News of the landmark 83 billionth birth sparked an outpouring of good tidings from around the globe, with millions of well-wishers sending cards and letters offering blessings to the media-dubbed "miracle baby. " Dozens of world leaders have phoned to express their congratulations, including Chinese Premier Li Peng, who called Darryl "a living miracle" and "a joy to all mankind. " Warring factions in Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Turkey have called week-long cease-fires in honor of the miraculous birth. In a special message from St. Peter's Basilica, Pope John Paul II spoke of the miracle child. "In our all-too-cynical modern age, the birth of Darryl Severson is proof that miracles do indeed exist," the pope said. "In this special time, it is fitting that we should offer thanks and praise to our Father in Heaven for this, the most precious of His blessings: the blessing of life. The pope went on to commend Carla Severson for her abstention from birth control, a sin which, had it been committed, would have prevented her pregnancy and delayed humankind's reaching the 83 billion mark by as much as 1/64th of a second. The pope also noted that, with a total of five certifiable miracles to her credit, Mrs. Severson may qualify for canonization as a saint after her death. Narrowly missing the chance to be the record-breaking 83 billionth baby were Manoj Ranaghat, born 1/16th of a second earlier to starving peasants in the drought-stricken village of Bijapur, India; Phillippe Duclos, born 1/32nd of a second earlier in Lyon, France; and Baby X, delivered just 1/64th of a second earlier than Darryl in a Bronx housing project, but unfortunately born dead. "I'm overjoyed for the Seversons. They are truly blessed," said Marcia Ott, a neighbor of the family, reacting to the sudden crush of media attention focused on their small Arkansas town. "I've heard about miracles before, but you never think something like this is going to happen to someone you know. The miraculous birth will likely have a major impact on Dwayne and Carla Severson, as they are expected to devote a majority of their waking hours tending to the baby's many miraculous needs. When not getting miraculously waken at 3 a.m., the couple will be miraculously occupied feeding Darryl and changing his miraculous diapers whenever he miraculously defecates. But for all the attention, the couple remain humble about their achievement. "It wasn't exactly like we planned it, to be honest," Dwayne said. "In fact, when Carla told me she was pregnant again, I was kinda worried, on account of me losing my job at the screen-door factory and all. Money's real tight right now, and I wasn't sure we could make ends meet. But still, us having to sell the trailer and temporarily move back into Carla's parents' place isn't so bad, if you think about it, since it's a such a miracle, I guess. "I love my baby so much," Carla said. "He's the most precious little angel that ever flew down from heaven. Though the 83 billion figure is the one generally agreed upon, experts concede that the precise number is somewhat more nebulous. "It all depends on how you tabulate the miracles," Cornell University biology professor Dr. Isaac Gregson said. "Eighty-three billion includes not only all the humans who have ever been born, but also all the Cro-Magnons, Neanderthals, Australopithecines and other proto-hominids going all the way back to the first mammals. Of course, if you were to include the rest of the vertebrates in the animal kingdom, it would be even higher. And if you were to also include plankton, unicellular microorganisms and all plant life, the actual number would be closer to, say, umpteen gadzillion. But why quibble about numbers at a time like this? Darryl's birth is a one-of-a-kind special moment that has deeply inspired the world, reminding us all of just what it is that life is all about. Noted essayist and biologist Stephen Jay Gould agreed, calling the latest addition to the Severson household "a miracle beyond compare. "It's an amazing turn of events, no doubt about it," Gould said. "Just think: A spermatozoa from a male mammal fertilized the ovum of a female mammal, causing a fetus to develop and, in time, come to term and pass through the female's birth canal as a new being. It just goes to show that there are some mysteries even science cannot explain.

Breakup Hints Misinterpreted As Marriage-Proposal Hints
KNOXVILLE, TN — Amanda Gentry, 25, has misinterpreted longtime boyfriend Wilson Crandall's recent break-up hints — including erratic behavior and strange, cryptic remarks about their future — as marriage-proposal hints. "I can tell Wilson is getting ready to pop the question," Gentry said. "The last few weeks, he's been acting so weird. He keeps saying he needs to 'take stock of his life' and 'face some important decisions he's been putting off.' I hear wedding bells! Though Crandall, 26, a University of Tennessee law student, rarely articulates his feelings about the state of the couple's three-year relationship, Gentry said his occasional remarks "speak volumes. "A couple weeks ago, right after sex, Wilson got really odd and quiet, like he wanted to say something but couldn't get it out," Gentry said. "Finally, he told me, 'I think you're a great girl, and I just want you always to be happy.' Isn't that so sweet? The post-coital exchange went no further, Gentry said, with Crandall telling her only that he needed to talk to her about their future at some point. Two weeks later, the talk has yet to occur. "He's studying for the bar, but when he's done, he wants to sit down with me," Gentry said. "He says he has something important to say and that I should brace myself. Isn't it obvious? He's finishing law school this May and thinking about settling down. Goin' to the cha-pel…" Gentry said she hopes Crandall will take her someplace romantic to propose. "Wilson recently said something about getting away and going somewhere for a week in March," Gentry said. "A few days later, I caught him looking for plane tickets on the Internet. It's weird that he was pricing tickets for around the time of the NCAA Final Four tournament, since I wouldn't think he'd want to miss that. But, obviously, making a commitment to a life partner is so much more important. Recently, Crandall has been asking Gentry about her career goals, a line of questioning she misread as a sign that he is mapping out their life together. "He never asked me about social work before, but he's really been encouraging me to invest more of myself into my job," Gentry said. "He thinks fulfillment at work should be a bigger component of my life. Don't worry, Wilson, I have no plans to give up my career to have babies. Yet." Gentry said Crandall even let slip that he was thinking about moving away from Knoxville after graduating. "Wilson's been dropping little hints that he might try to get a job back in Chicago, where his parents and sister are," Gentry said. "He's definitely the type of guy who'd want to be close to his family if he was thinking about the long term. Crandall has not explicitly invited Gentry to accompany him in the event of a move — an omission Gentry attributes to his fears that she may not want to go. "Whenever we talk about Chicago, he goes on and on about how I'd hate the cold weather and the fast pace," Gentry said. "He's such a doll to be concerned about my feelings, but doesn't he know I'd follow him anywhere? Gentry has also misinterpreted Crandall's recent frugality as an effort to save up money for the future. "It's so cute how he's trying to cut back on expenses," Gentry said. "We never go out to dinner anymore, or the movies, or even the bars. He must be working on one doozy of a rock. "Wilson's birthday is coming up soon, March 4," Gentry continued. "Maybe he's planning to pop the question then. I can just see him getting down on one knee and saying that I'm what he wants most for his birthday. Added Gentry: "God, the next few weeks are going to be unforgettable.

Woman Begins To Regret Dating Someone Spontaneous
AUBURN, CA — After four months of romantic involvement, Wells Fargo mortgage lending assistant Heidi Bird, 27, said Monday that she is beginning to regret getting into a relationship with the carefree Jason Maddox. "Jason was everything I wanted in a boyfriend as recently as three months ago," Bird said. "I used to dream of meeting someone who knew how to have fun and didn't let himself get weighed down by formalities and obligations. But my dreams never had the part where that person doesn't call for a week, then drops by at 3 a.m. with a broken mannequin torso under his arm. Bird said she was swept off her feet by the handsome 30-year-old in August, when she met him at a local park. A part-time bicycle-shop employee and occasional street musician, Maddox "was straight out of a romantic Hollywood movie," according to Bird. "I was walking my dog Shadow when I heard someone call out to me from above," Bird said. "I looked up and saw Jason sitting on a tree branch. He told me he once had a dog like Shadow. Then he asked me to come on up and see the view. I don't usually do stuff like that, but he was so cute and intriguing that I tied Shadow to a bench and joined him up on the branch. We sat up there for two hours eating golden raisins and reading jokes from this kids' joke book he fished from the trash. It seemed magical — at the time. Although she gave him her phone number, Bird didn't hear from Maddox until two weeks later, when he showed up at her office, thrust a bouquet of daisies into her hands, and began to serenade her on his ukulele. "Jason showed up right in the middle of my busiest day of the week, and all of my coworkers were staring at him like he was nuts," Bird said. "But no one had ever done something like that for me before, and I just melted. It was such a wonderful resolution to the anxiety I'd been feeling because he hadn't called. When she showed Maddox out of her building, the two kissed during the elevator ride to the lobby, commencing what Bird described as "a whirlwind love affair, complete with romance, laughter, and amazing sex. In spite of the good times she has shared with him, Bird said Maddox's self-centered approach to romance has "gotten a little old. "Last week, Jason showed up at my office, called me out of a staff meeting, and said we were going roller-skating," Bird said. "When I told him I couldn't, he was like, 'Well, what am I supposed to do with these roller skates I bought you for our 13-week anniversary?' "He lacks a sense of timing — or time, really," Bird added. "When I got mad at him last month for not calling me for six days, he said he was sorry and explained that he'd been 'totally getting into Russia,' whatever that means. Bird said that, during the initial weeks of her relationship with Maddox, she had hoped to one day accompany him on one of his spur-of-the-moment car trips. After getting lost on the way to Mono Lake with Maddox in November, however, Bird said she resolved "never to travel with Jason again. "It was sweet that he wanted to sit by the lake holding me in his arms," Bird said. "But he could've had some idea of how to get there. Maybe he didn't mind sleeping in the car at a rest stop, but my shoulder blade still aches from where the seat spring dug into it all night. Although Maddox frequently demonstrates his affection for Bird, she said his gestures no longer move her. "Oh, yeah, Jason gave me that," said Bird, waving toward a 6-foot-tall plush bunny in the corner of her office. "There was a time I would've been really into it, but now I'm just wondering how much it cost and if I'll need to buy us both dinner next Tuesday." Bird added: "I should really get that thing out of here before my supervisor sees it. Therapist and author Sue Merrill said people often don't foresee the pitfalls of dating a spontaneous person. "In order to have a viable relationship, you must either match his erratic behavior point-for-point, or maintain an almost bulletproof independence," Merrill said. "Vulnerability is fatal. Ask yourself this, 'Do I have the stamina to water my plants one moment, float in a hot-air balloon an hour later, spend eight days alone, then stand in line at a bail-bonds office until 1 a.m. on a Tuesday?'" While Bird has no immediate plans to break up with Maddox, she said she"sometimes fantasize[s] about what it would be like to date someone less whimsical. "I still like Jason a lot," Bird said. "But I swear: The next time he starts to juggle, it's over. Bird's ex-boyfriend Steve Dandridge, whom she left last May after telling him he was "too boring," said his mellow, undemanding personality might offer Bird a refreshing change. "I hear that guy she's going out with is running her ragged," Dandridge said. "I guess I could feel happy that I got my revenge, but the truth is, I still miss her. Heidi, if you want me back in your life, gimme a call. I usually go get dinner at 6:45 or 7:00, but I'm always back before CSI starts at 8:00." Maddox was unavailable for comment, as he was assembling a Cupid costume out of a bed sheet and applying to film school in Poland.

Boyfriend Ready To Take Relationship To Previous Level
COLUMBIA, SC - Following a romantic three-day getaway to South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, 32-year-old Matthew Sullivan said he is now "more ready than ever" to take his 10-month relationship with girlfriend Carol Moag to the previous level. "After spending every waking moment with Carol for 72 hours, I know in my heart that I'm prepared to see her face twice, maybe even once a week," said Sullivan, who met Moag, 34, at a friend's New Year's party in January. Sullivan claimed he has been considering "taking the big leap backward" since Moag suggested last month that the two get a cat. The weekend of uninterrupted intimacy served to erase whatever reservations Sullivan may still have held about the move. "I know this is a big decision, but I'm ready for it," said Sullivan as he picked up a few DVDs and books he had left at Moag's apartment before she returned home from work. "I've given this a lot of thought, and whenever I imagine giving Carol the keys to her place back, it just feels right. "I'm so excited about this," he added. Though Sullivan admitted being initially nervous about Moag's reaction to the sudden announcement, he said he was confident that she will, if not right away, eventually see that his instincts are correct. "I'm not sure she'll be ready to take the plunge like this," Sullivan said. "But if I give her plenty of space and lots and lots of time by herself to think it through, she'll realize that we're meant to be together a lot less. Sullivan said he hoped the couple's new lowered level of commitment will provide them an opportunity to grow as individuals and really make the relationship work for Sullivan. "It isn't going to be easy, but no one wants this more than I do," said Sullivan, who believes that his clarity at this important juncture is a direct sign of his advanced maturity. "As you get older, you recognize what's really important to you," Sullivan said. "When I made the decision to get a lot less serious with Carol, I just felt this sense of peace. I can tell by the look in her eyes — that loving, longing gaze — that I must act now before I miss my chance. Sullivan said that he is continually surprised by how "time just flies by" in his relationship with Moag. The 32-year-old said he has a gut sense that if he does not make her aware of his feelings soon, it will be too late. "What happens now will determine the rest of our future together," said Sullivan, who claimed that he did not want to repeat the mistakes he made in previous long-term relationships. "The last woman I was with [ex-wife Maria Heller], I let this moment pass me by, and I'll always regret it. "I ended up living with her for two and half years," Sullivan added.

Sorta-Attractive Girl Half-Heartedly Hit On
COOL SPRINGS, TN — During a weekend house party characterized as "okay," paint-store employee Peter Elsing, 24, mustered up just enough interest to hit on Theresa Scobel, a sort of good-looking Vanderbilt graduate student, Elsing said Monday. "Theresa was…cute," Elsing said. "She could've been in better shape. Not saying I couldn't either, of course. She definitely had a cute face. I've seen worse. The party, held Saturday night at the apartment of Elsing's longtime friend Warren Croft, was subdued, with fewer than 20 attendees. Elsing said boredom and a shortage of eligible female guests inspired him to speak to the tall, curly-haired Scobel. According to Elsing, of the seven women present, five came with dates. The only two unattached females were Scobel and her friend, whom Elsing identified as "Kate or Kim or something. "I guess the Kim girl had worked with Warren once, but she didn't know anyone else at the party, so she talked Theresa into coming with her," Elsing said. "To be honest, I would've been just as likely to hit on Kim, but she kept going outside to smoke or plug the meter or something. Added Elsing: "Look, it was either talk to Theresa or hang out on the sofa and eat Baked Tostitos with Warren's weird friend Phillip [Barger]." Elsing said his conversation with Scobel was "civil," but also punctuated by awkward silences and nervous laughter. "Halfway through my conversation with Theresa, my urge to hit on her ebbed a little," Elsing said. "But I went on anyway. Force of habit, I guess. During their conversation, Elsing learned that Scobel earned her undergraduate major in Latin American studies at the University of Delaware, can speak fluent Spanish and Portuguese, recently returned from a three-week Mayan art and culture study-seminar in the Yucatan Peninsula, and has nothing whatsoever in common with him. "I asked her why she was interested in Latin American stuff," Elsing said. "I can't exactly remember what she said — something about being part Latin. She seemed really smart. I would've been totally intimidated by her, if she'd been gorgeous. About 20 minutes into the halting exchange, Elsing embarked on a tentative flirt, and told Scobel that the gray top she was wearing was "nice." "She thanked me and told me that my eyes were very intense," Elsing said. "That was kind of cool. But I was also like, whoa, that was a pretty big leap she made — from clothes to body parts. It's not like I pointed out a physical feature of hers. Hopefully, I haven't released the floodgates here. In spite of the pair's lack of chemistry, Elsing requested Scobel's phone number and suggested that they meet for coffee some time in the coming weeks. "I thought about inviting her to go to Club 505 after the party, but I figured that would be too forward, like I was trying to liquor her up," Elsing said. "Besides, I was getting tired. Really, I just wanted to get home. Elsing said he gave Scobel credit for inspiring him to remain at the party longer than he would have otherwise. "I still can't decide whether I'll call her," Elsing said. "Maybe I should give her a chance. She seemed all right. Not overtly weird. She was nice, I guess. I don't know. We'll see. It might be fun. Or not. Maybe." Party host Croft said he saw Elsing and Scobel talking. "I noticed Peter hanging out with Kaitlin's friend Theresa at the party," Croft said. "It sorta looked like maybe they were getting along. That'd be cool if they hooked up. She wasn't really my type — a little too plain. But she seemed cool enough, I guess. As for Scobel, she said she is ambivalent about receiving a phone call from Elsing. "Peter was nice, but I wish I hadn't given him my number," she said. "I just did it because…I don't know. I honestly didn't mean to send him mixed signals. I just made that remark about his eyes to get him to relax a little.

Date Disastrously Bypasses Physical Intimacy, Goes Straight To Emotional Intimacy
CHAPEL HILL, NC — An initially promising date between University of North Carolina seniors Mike Rafelson and Jill Zehme veered disastrously off course Monday night, when the two skipped directly to intense emotional bonding, tragically bypassing the physical intimacy that usually precedes it. "It's not what you think — unfortunately," Rafelson told his roommates Tuesday morning after they watched him send Zehme off with a long, tight goodbye hug and an affectionate kiss on the forehead. "The date was going great — I could feel us getting closer and closer all night. I was totally psyched when she came home with me. But somehow I screwed up, and we ended up sharing our most personal thoughts and feelings without even making out first. Rafelson said he and Zehme met two weeks ago at Raleigh's Schoolkids Records, where they spent 20 minutes wandering past each other while pretending to look at vintage LPs, self-consciously brushing bangs back from their foreheads, and stealing glances at each other over the display racks. Rafelson said he "finally made a move" and asked Zehme about the album she was holding, Talking Heads: 77. In the 20-minute discussion that followed, Zehme not only told Rafelson how important the album had been to her during a troubling time in her adolescence, but that she worked at a local coffeehouse. "She went out of her way to describe the location of the Buzz Café and the hours she usually works," Rafelson said. "I was, like, 'Yeah! This is it, man — she totally likes me and I'm gonna get some action.' Unfortunately, I was only half right — and it was the wrong half. After he "happened to swing by" Buzz Café, Rafelson asked Zehme if she would like to see his friend's band, Chat!, thus launching the pair's ill-fated journey to non-physical intimacy. "When I picked her up, she looked really hot," Rafelson said. "After the show, we went to get some pizza, and our feet were touching under the table the whole time we ate. We talked for a long time about the trouble she was having finishing up her major, and I could totally relate. Everything seemed to be progressing so nicely. Well, I didn't know it at the time, but the feet thing was the closest physical contact we were going to share. At 12:30 a.m., as the couple walked to Rafelson's place, their conversation grew more personal. Rafelson talked about his last girlfriend, and Zehme discussed her financial problems. At his door, Rafelson said his roommates would not be home until later, and to his delight, Zehme agreed to come inside. Rafelson opened a bottle of wine, and the two sat talking and drinking in the living room for an hour before relocating to the bedroom. The bedroom, Zehme later told friends, is where she and Rafelson "started to open up about just everything. "From the moment I laid eyes on Mike, he seemed like the kind of guy I could really get close to," Zehme said. "He had such a sincere way about him — a face I could totally trust. Rafelson said it seemed that, given the circumstances, some form of sexual bonding was assured. As he and Zehme continued to talk, they spoke more passionately, their faces got closer together, and they began to stare intently into each other's eyes. "The intimacy in the room had worked its way to a fever pitch," Rafelson said. "But before I realized what was happening, disaster struck. Instead of stroking her date's thigh or taking off her shirt, Zehme began to tell Rafelson things she'd "never told anyone outside of [her] closest confidants. "I told Mike all my innermost feelings about my parents' traumatic divorce, my brother's drug problem, and my best friend's attempted suicide," Zehme said. "He was so sweet — he took my hand and told me to let it all out. And I did. I just let it all go. I was totally uninhibited that night. I've never been like that with anyone before. Two and a half hours later, the couple was firmly in the area that couples therapist Gus French described as "that awful horse latitude of male-female relations, the Sargasso Sea of non-sexual pair-bonding known to unhappy males the world over as 'the friend zone.' "My heart really goes out to this poor kid," French said. "We've all been there, thinking, 'Gee, this is really special that you're opening up to me about your childhood, but I've got to admit I'd rather be going down on you right now.' Unfortunately, once the emotional barrier has been crossed, there's no going back. By allowing the conversation to swerve into serious-talking territory before physical contact was established, Rafelson virtually guaranteed that he would not get into Zehme's pants. Rafelson corroborated French's prediction. "Jill said our date was one of the most special nights of her life," Rafelson said. "We talked long into the night until we fell asleep side by side — fully dressed. In the morning, before leaving, she gave me a huge, sincere, and utterly asexual hug — exactly the kind of hug someone would give her brother.

Naughty Baker's Diminished Sex Drive Starting To Affect His Work
GRAND FORKS, ND — Erotic baker Kevin Nageli has experienced a decline in the quality of his work following a recent reduction in his sex drive, Naughty Bites sources said Monday. "I feel bad saying it, but Kevin's really in a slump," said Hal DiPrima, Nageli's longtime friend and business partner. "There was a time no marzipan penis could compare to a Kevin Nageli. Now, though, look at this tray of cocks. No definition. The external urethral orifice is just a pinhole, and the texture of the shaft is all wrong. They just droop over the baking sheets. What am I going to tell the bachelorettes? Naughty Bites is a three-time winner of Grand Forks Magazine's "Best Place To Browse When You're Feeling Kooky" award, due in large part to the precision that once defined a Nageli erotic cake. His expertise was seen in all his work — from relatively tame bikini-clad breasts reading "Bon Voyage!" to the more-graphic, penis-shaped cakes reading "Make A Wish And Blow!" "The erotic bakery business is detail-oriented, but even I used to be amazed by the way Kevin would spend three hours a day shaving tiny curlicues off a hunk of dark chocolate, because he wanted the pubic hair to look just right," DiPrima said, shaking his head as he boxed a cake that read "Eat Me, Birthday Boy." "Now, he just takes a scoop of black sprinkles and dumps it over the iced vaginas. Somewhere under that lumpish mass is a Gummi Bear clitoris, but you'd never know it. By his own estimates, Nageli's business and marriage were going strong until May, when the pressures resulting from the birth of his second child and his mother-in-law's decision to move into the Nageli home caused sexual relations with his wife of five years to ebb. Nageli said he has found his attention diverted away from sex and sexy cakes alike. "As you get older, sometimes the things that practically defined your life when you were younger become less important," Nageli said. "Lately, sex is the last thing on my mind. These days, all I want to do is finish my business as quickly as possible so I can go away, smoke a cigarette, and relax in front of the TV. But try telling that to my wife. Or my customers. Nageli didn't seem particularly bothered by his attitude shift. "Yeah, occasionally customers used to say stuff like they hated to eat my 'You're the purr-fect valentine' pussy cakes, because they were fascinated by all the intricate labial folds piped around the vagina," Nageli said. "But lately, I've come around to thinking that a spatula does essentially the same trick as a pastry tube. I mean, a vulva's a vulva, right? Nageli has even begun to design cakes without erotic content, such as a rectangular, two-layer cake he decorates to resemble a hardcover copy of the bestselling book Tuesdays With Morrie. Nageli's business partner said he was "dismayed" by the baker's post-sexual period. "I cannot sell a cake shaped like a remote control in an erotic bakery," DiPrima said. "Maybe I can make it look like a vibrator if I flick off these candy buttons. But only a pervert would think this resembles something you put up your ass. Nageli's personal and professional decline is not unique. Erotic baker Brad Hicks, who closed his Oshkosh, WI establishment The Sexy Sweet Shoppe in February 2000, complained of similar disillusionment, which he described as "classic burnout. "I'm not sure if my divorce caused me to lose inspiration for my work, or if it was making those endless Torpedo Tit Tarts that destroyed my marriage," said Hicks, now a postal worker. "But at some point, a little voice inside my head said, "Brad, if you don't care how 'come' is spelled on a cake, maybe the naughty-pastry business isn't the place for you anymore.' Using milk to thin the batter for what would eventually become a sagging breast cake, Nageli admitted that he could understand why an erotic-cake customer might not want to buy one of his newer creations. "I realize most of my customers would prefer cakes that said 'Eat Me' instead of 'Maybe Later, Baby,'" Nageli said. "But maybe there's a hidden, untapped novelty pastry market for people just like me.

New Roommate Hopes Five-Hour Fuckfest Didn't Keep You Up
OSHKOSH, WI — Roommate Brian Penderman, 26, announced Monday morning that he hopes the loud bumping, grinding, and moaning of the five-hour-long fuckfest he had with his girlfriend did not in any way prevent you from sleeping last night. "I'm exhausted — are you exhausted? " Penderman asked while he extended his arms in a stretching motion and yawned loudly. "Honestly, though, I sincerely apologize if all that fucking that was going on in my bedroom kept you up until the early hours of the morning. Penderman, who moved into the apartment last September based on your buddy Dave's insistence that he was an all-right guy, was never pressed for details, but openly volunteered information regarding the fuckfest's length, the nakedness of his girlfriend, and the number of times they "did it. " According to sources in the apartment, Penderman's most recent fuckfest was also his first fuckfest since moving in. "Just so you know, we didn't plan this or anything," said Penderman, referring to the self- described fuckfest that took place between approximately 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. "Out of respect for you, we were just going to have a quickie. In fact, I was done and ready to go to sleep after 20 minutes, but she kept begging for more. Added Penderman: "You know how chicks can be. Confessing that the fuckfest had taken a considerable toll on his body, Penderman voiced numerous complaints ranging from aching arms to chafed knees to a sore penis. Penderman went on to explain that the reason his penis was so sore was because it had repeatedly entered and exited a female vagina the night before. While his girlfriend reportedly hurried out of the apartment at 7 a.m. in order to return to her hometown of Shawano and was therefore unavailable for comment, Penderman apologized on her behalf for all the loud, crazy sex noises you must have been hearing. Penderman admitted, however, that he was not prepared to discount the likelihood of another fuckfest occurring very soon. "I can't say it won't happen again, because she's talking about taking the bus down here in August," Penderman said. "You might want to go away that weekend. But if you are around, I'll slip a note under your door saying 'Having fuckfest' and you'll know. "Not that you wouldn't know anyway," he added, despite your repeated insistence that you in fact slept very well. "As you might have noticed, she's a bit of a moaner. Though Penderman established that he has not seen you bring home anyone in months, he stated that he would not be opposed to you having a fuckfest. "This is your home, you should be able to bang all night long anytime you want — like I did," Penderman said. "I'd be happy to ask my girlfriend if she knows anybody who might be interested in you. Throughout the day and then again that afternoon when you returned home from running errands, Penderman continued to express regret that "this place reeks of sex," which he blamed equally on the considerable amount of intercourse he was having over and over again yesterday and the apartment's thin walls. Penderman added that he would be glad to buy a scented candle or air freshener at the store this evening, when he goes to replace the large number of condoms he used the previous night. "Fuckfests are not all fun and games, my friend," Penderman added. "It's a lot of hard work to just keep going on and on and on. I mean, you heard us, right? Before your departure from the apartment for the night, Penderman offered to have an open discussion about the fuckfest "when you're ready," in order to answer any questions you might have about the fuckfest and to assure you that he will try to conduct future fuckfests in a way that will not cause you to feel uncomfortable or jealous to be living with a guy who gets it so regular.

Guy From Sopranos Drops By Local Pizza Parlor For Free Slice
MANALAPAN, NJ — Upon getting hungry, actor Tony Sirico, best known for his role as Paulie "Walnuts" Gualtieri on The Sopranos, drove to a Manalapan-area pizza parlor Tuesday in order to obtain a free slice of cheese pizza. Sirico, who entered the establishment wearing a jogging suit similar to the one his character wore in the popular HBO series, was immediately recognized and offered a complimentary slice, which he accepted. "I didn't ask for extra toppings or nothing, because that'd be pushing it," said Sirico, who also did not correct the store's owner when he referred to him as "Paulie." "But I loaded it up pretty good with the garlic and Parmesan shakers they got off to the side. That's the way to do it. " Sirico then drove 15 minutes to Don's Pizza King in Allenwood, NJ to get another slice.

Botanists Vow Not To Discuss Botany During After-Work Drinks
AMHERST, MA — After years of promising not to discuss work after hours but always failing, botanists at Hampshire College's Agricultural Studies Farm Center told reporters yesterday they have finally made a pledge to ban any and all talk of plants during drinks this Friday. "We always say we're going to leave it at the lab, but when you get a group of us botanists together, the subject of how mycology falls under the umbrella of ethnobotany is bound to come up," said Dr. Cynthia Devlin, admitting that in the past she has been guilty of filling awkward gaps in conversation with fungi- related anecdotes from the workday. "But this time we mean it. The first person to even think about bringing up petioles or lateral buds is out. " According to Devlin, the group's efforts to separate phytopathology and pleasure will be greatly aided by the decision to move their weekly get-together to Marty's Bar & Grille from the Rainforest Café.

Formerly Obese Man Always Showing Everyone His Old Pants
RUFFS DALE, PA — According to John Swink's friends, family, coworkers, and casual acquaintances, as well as a growing number of local waiters and waitresses, the formerly obese history teacher takes every opportunity to show just how dramatic his recent weight loss has been by smiling broadly and holding his old 52-inch-waist jeans next to his fit and trim new body. "He likes to get inside his old pants and turn to the side," Swink's mechanic, Greg Forrester, told reporters Tuesday, describing Swink's effort to clearly illustrate how much space now exists between the front of his old pants and his stomach. "At least that's what he did when he brought his car into the shop, when he saw my wife and kids at the supermarket the other day, and when he stood up in the middle of the varsity baseball game last weekend. " Students of Swink's said he has recently begun teaching lessons from behind the giant cardboard cutout of his old 315-pound self that he carries around with him everywhere he goes.

Town Uglification Committee Approves New Pile Of Garbage Bags
LOUDONVILLE, OH — As part of ongoing efforts to maintain the town's unplesasant appearance, members of the Loudonville Uglification Committee unanimously approved a measure Tuesday to preserve the 16 overflowing garbage bags filled with old newspapers, beer bottles, and decaying food in the middle of the Cedar Street sidewalk. "We're going to do all we can to make sure these new piles of trash are in full view of anyone who comes to visit our little town, as well as those who call Loudonville home," said chairwoman Karen Spalding, who oversees all of the town's upkeep, including planting weeds in parks, spray-painting profanities on the walls of the public library, and smearing dog feces at prominent intersections. "It's important that our work properly reflects the type of people who live here. " Spalding added that she was confident this latest initiative would attract businesses interested in dumping their waste products directly into the Mohican River.

New Roommates Attempt To Find Manly Way Of Saying Good Night
MINNEAPOLIS — One month after moving into their shared apartment, roommates Nick Horowitz, 23, and Dan Crenshaw, 24, are still trying to find an appropriately masculine way to bid each other good night, Crenshaw told reporters Tuesday. "We started out by bumping fists and saying 'night bro,' and right now we're getting by with really sarcastically saying 'nighty-night, sweetie,'" said Crenshaw, who recounted several other short-lived nightly salutations, including a particularly ill-conceived attempt that ended in an awkward half hug. "I think I'm going to try out something tonight like 'good night, fuckface,' and we'll go from there. " Crenshaw said that the good-morning greeting of grunting, scratching, and repeatedly calling each other "queer" seems to be fulfilling the pair's needs at present.

Area Senior Remembers A Simpler Time When His Anus Didn't Leak
CARSON CITY, NV — Looking out his window as the cars zoom by and a jet plane rumbles overhead, 87-year-old Hank Fletcher sees a world far different from the one in which he grew up. In his day, the retired factory worker says, life was simpler. The streets were quieter, people were more polite, neighbors all knew one another, and his anus did not emit oily discharges of liquid stool. But times have changed. "When I was a young man, there was no uncertainty in the world — dinner was at 5:30 sharp, people who got married stayed that way, and my anus didn't leak," Fletcher says. "I can still remember playing stickball till the sun dipped below the trees. Why, I'd round the bases pretending I was Rogers Hornsby without ever having to think about a viscous brown liquid trickling down my leg. The future seemed so bright. As time marches on, Fletcher remains one of the last direct links to a bygone era of American life when people passed their evenings relaxing by the fireside or listening to Hopalong Cassidy on the radio. Mothers and fathers would sit on couches free from protective plastic covers, and children would play games in the corner, oblivious to the crime, famine, and warm streams of fluid seeping out of their anal cavities that seem so commonplace today. "How I loved to stroll down the promenade arm in arm with my best gal, Dorothy," Fletcher says, shifting in his chair as he pages wistfully through a faded old scrapbook. "We'd talk and laugh, unconstrained by bulky plastic sacks tied to our waists, and go into all the shops — never to buy anything, of course, just to look and to dream. We'd wander along the boardwalk all evening, she with her blue Gainsborough hat and I with my clean underpants, all the while holding hands and not ejecting fecal matter from our anuses. "But Dorothy's been gone for many a year now," he adds as he closes the scrapbook, "and as for my anus, well, as I said before, it leaks constantly. Seated on a rocking chair covered in a blue tarpaulin to protect the wood from foul-smelling stains, Fletcher chuckled to recall how tiny and hard to come by TV sets were in those days. His family had only one car, he could see a movie for a quarter, soda pop only cost a nickel, and his sphincter was strong enough to expand and contract when he intended instead of hanging permanently open like an unlatched floodgate. "Back then, the days were as cool and sweet as a sip of lemonade, and the night sky was filled to the brim with bright shiny stars," Fletcher says. "Now there's so much noise and pollution that you can't even hear yourself think. People are always screaming and shouting for no good reason, zipping around from place to place, and the hustle and the bustle and my anus leaks, and it's all computers. "Glenn Miller, jalopy rides, Lucky Lindy, my non-leaking anus," Fletcher adds. "Those were the days. Indeed, this octogenarian lived most his life in a time that made him proud to be an American and during which he did not have to change his pants five times a day. He can recall as if it were yesterday seeing the troops come home after Normandy, when the nation was riding high and his feces were satisfyingly firm cylinders that easily held their shape in water; and watching two men land on the moon just moments after he expelled the contents of his bowels all at once in the bathroom rather than in dribs and drabs over the course of an afternoon. Then, on Sept. 11, 2001, terrorists flew two hijacked planes into the World Trade Center and Fletcher's anus leaked, and he knew the world had changed forever. "Things ain't how they used to be," he says, shaking his head. "Especially in regards to my anus. Despite it all, Fletcher admits that today's youth have it harder than ever. Amid fears of war, global warming, and political instability, Fletcher leaves the younger generations with a simple word of advice from a man who has seen it all. "Every once in a while, take a moment to appreciate everything you have in this life," Fletcher says, "because before you know it, the world will pass you by, and also your underpants will be moist with shit.

Tennessee Helpless Against New Basement Tornadoes
MEMPHIS, TN — Officials from the National Weather Service issued a severe weather alert for all basements in Tennessee Tuesday after a deadly new weather phenomenon ravaged scores of residential downstairs areas, leaving every other part of the houses completely untouched. The recently discovered targeted cyclones, known as basement tornadoes, tore through cellars all over the state, killing dozens and injuring hundreds. Calling the recent devastation the worst indoor weather event in U.S. history, weather service director Dr. John L. Hayes said that millions of residents who have for years been taught to seek shelter from twisters by taking refuge in their homes will have to drastically adjust long-held assumptions about tornado safety and preparedness. "If there is a violently rotating column of air in your basement, do not go downstairs," Hayes said. "Wait in an attic or at the top of a stairwell. If possible, find shelter in a structure lacking any kind of subterranean open space at all, such as a mobile home. "Unless, of course, regular tornadoes are sighted in the area, in which case you should immediately get to your basement, provided you have one," Hayes added. Meteorologists have measured the spiraling basement winds at speeds of up to 200 mph — powerful enough in some cases to drive a box of dryer sheets six inches into solid concrete. In all, the cyclones have caused hundreds of dollars in property damage by toppling artificial Christmas trees, smashing jars of fruit preserves, and overturning ping-pong tables. "Some people lost their entire basements," said Knoxville-area relief worker Dan Weiss, who personally observed a dozen rec rooms that were completely destroyed, and a half-dozen more that might have been destroyed, though it was difficult to say for sure. "Everything they had ever stored was suddenly lost. So much extra stuff gone to waste. Using Doppler radar, interior satellites, and computer models, researchers have determined that basement tornadoes form when warm dank air collides with a cool dry draft, creating a significant drop in pressure, and causing wind velocity to increase and whirl in a vortex of dust, debris, and cobwebs. Predicting where and when a basement tornado will strike is challenging, however, because they seem to jump from cellar to cellar by traveling through sump pumps. "All we can say for certain is that unfinished basements are twice as likely to develop tornadoes," said Allan Boyer, a controlled meteorogist at the National Storm Prediction Center in Norman, OK. "Also, when residents leave their washing machines and dryers running it creates the ideal environment for tornadoes, because of the extra spinningness it causes in the air. The NSPC has developed a scale for ranking the intensity of basement tornadoes with the lowest rating, B0, only causing mild shag-carpet disturbances, and the highest, B5, capable of destroying workbenches and water heaters. According to NSPC statistics, independent-minded siblings between the ages of 16 and 19 who always want to be alone are most likely to be injured by basement tornadoes. The second highest at-risk group is families huddling in basements waiting for normal tornadoes to pass. The outbreak of basement tornadoes has also raised a slew of privacy issues, pitting so-called storm hunters against homeowners, since those who study the deadly new phenomenon say they must gain access to private residences to be able to set up their equipment and observe the storms. Angry residents have already forced dozens of researchers camping in their cellars out of their homes, and at least two have been shot at or violently assaulted for peering through basement windows. While the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the NWS have been working together to develop new nationwide evacuation guidelines, officials say it is a complicated process. "Even if a storm warning goes into effect hours before a tornado strikes, we caution citizens against attempting to flee the area in automobiles, since this will dramatically increase their chances of being severely injured or killed by car tornadoes," FEMA administrator R. David Paulison said. "This could shape up to be the worst development in natural disasters since the 2003 spate of earthquakes that struck directly under doorways and large desks.

Badly Injured Man Not Done Partying Yet
BATON ROUGE, LA — Veteran partier Adam Girard announced his intentions to continue partying late Saturday evening, assuring onlookers that the multiple injuries he had sustained over the previous six hours did not require medical attention, and were not severe enough to prematurely end the festivities. Despite the fact that Girard, who was attending a house party near the Louisiana State Univeristy campus, had twice fallen more than eight feet onto his shoulder while attempting to walk along the front-porch banister, the 24-year-old bookstore clerk appeared resolute in his commitment to continue consuming alcohol, singing, dancing, and hitting empty beer cans like baseballs with the tube of an old vacuum cleaner. "Whoo! Party!" Girard said. "Someone get — turn on Rock Band. I'll be all like, 'Bwah. Bwah-bwah.'" According to witnesses, the recent college graduate arrived at the party sometime during the mid-afternoon barbecue without any visible bruises, abrasions, or long scratch marks down the left side of his face. As the afternoon progressed, Girard enjoyed an estimated 12 Miller Lites before moving on to rum and Cokes, shots of tequila, boxed wine, and Miller Lite again. By 10:30 p.m., onlookers said, Girard had played more than a dozen games of beer pong and badly scraped the insides of both arms attempting to climb a nearby oak tree on what he misinterpreted as a dare. "I really just wanted to keep my distance," said party attendee Eric McGill, 22, who added that he did not know how Girard had irritated his eye, but guessed it had something to do with an earlier incident involving a can of hairspray. "He was scaring the shit out of me. I have no idea how he managed that keg stand with his elbow bent back like that. A number of acquaintances said they were unable to dissuade Girard from completing his partying agenda, which apparently included riding a mattress down a flight of stairs and "boxing" a number of lawn ornaments. "I tried to tell him sprains don't heal themselves, but he kept calling me a pussy and telling me to chug," said Girard's roommate, 23-year-old Darren Iverson. "I wasn't even holding a beer at the time. I'm pretty sure he has a concussion. Added Iverson, "And I know you can't use Jäger to clean a wound. At several points throughout the evening, those in attendance assumed Girard had ceased partying and gone home. Though everyone thought Girard had left, a small group arriving at the party shortly after midnight discovered him lying behind a shrub in the front of the house. When they woke him, Girard reportedly jumped up "like a fucking leopard or something" and ran into the house. A few hours later, Girard was seen taking a bicycle from a neighbor's garage and pedaling down the street, yelling out that he was going to go for a swim and that his collarbone was fine. "When he came back, his hair had some blood in it and there were grass stains all over his shirt," said Jenny Bergman, 21, who added that she did not realize the figure stumbling across the front lawn was Girard until she saw that he was drinking beer from a Crock Pot. "He was holding a license plate for some reason, which he threw onto the roof. "I offered to bandage his arm but he said his biceps would just break it," Bergman continued. This was reportedly not the first time Girard has persevered through significant obstacles. In May 2007, he overcame a dislocated shoulder to attend the minor-league baseball game he had spent the morning tailgating for; later that summer, Girard won a poker tournament even after burning his hands attempting to light shots of vodka on fire; and, on his 21st birthday, he partied all night despite having spinal meningitis. Host Brian Warren, 23, finally asked Girard to leave and check in to the hospital at 4:15 a.m., just after Girard broke Warren's plastic lawn furniture attempting to climb onto the roof for the third time that evening. "I need my license plate," Girard said. "Fucking." Though Girard had not returned home as of press time, a limping hitchhiker fitting his description was recently seen across town wearing a shower curtain and asking for a ride "back to the party.

Folk Art Museum Acquires Rare Visitor
NEW YORK — Representatives from the American Folk Art Museum held a press conference Wednesday, announcing that the "Legacy in Throw Rugs" exhibit had acquired a rare visitor, Ms. Marnie Schneider, who was discovered near the janitor's closet in the hubcap paintings wing. "Ms. Schneider is a real find, definitely a one of a kind," said head curator Natalie Kiernan, who estimated the historically significant attendee's value was priceless. "You could go years without seeing one of these. " Kiernan admitted that, while the visitor had clearly seen some wear and tear, she appeared to be in surprisingly good shape for her age.

Local Bar Comes Out As Gay
SEATTLE — After years of trying to deny the obvious and fit in with other downtown establishments, area bar Mad Hatters finally came out as gay this week, shocking hundreds of residents who thought they knew the Seattle tavern. Mad Hatters owner Greg Peterson, who delivered the brave announcement to friends, family members, and regular patrons Friday night, said that admitting his bar was gay was one of the hardest things he's ever had to do. "From the very first day we opened, I could sense there was something different about my bar," Peterson said. "At first, I thought the paisley wallpaper and infused-vodka martinis was just a phase the business was going through — that whatever was happening inside Mad Hatters would eventually pass. But it never did. That feeling never went away. Added Peterson, "We're here. We're queer. We offer excellent happy-hour specials every night of the week. While he now feels a tremendous sense of relief, Peterson said that he spent the first few years managing Mad Hatters the way he thought other "normal" bars were run. Large television screens broadcasting football games were hung from the walls, Guinness and Budweiser were served by the pint, and in 2003, a weekly Ladies' Night was awkwardly instituted. Still, Peterson said, everything Mad Hatters tried felt forced and unnatural. "The more I tried to fight the truth, the more I realized just how different Mad Hatters was from those Irish pubs and sports bars down the street," Peterson said. "I can't tell you the number of dartboards I bought thinking it would change the types of people we were attracting. It's embarrassing, but I even considered changing our name to Stallone's at one point. "To think of all those years I refused to get a karaoke machine because of how it might make us look," Peterson continued. When asked why he waited so long to have his bar come out, Peterson said he was afraid people would treat Mad Hatters differently once they discovered the truth. In addition, Peterson reportedly worried that the news might make some customers uncomfortable or even embarrassed to be seen around the bar. Despite his worries, Mad Hatters has so far received overwhelming support from neighboring establishments, with representatives from the Green Apple Diner calling the decision courageous, and managers from a nearby Rite Aid claiming they're "totally cool with whatever Mad Hatters wants to be, or is, or whatever. In fact, many residents who have known the bar since their high school days said that Mad Hatters' announcement came as no surprise. "It's about time," said University of Washington sophomore Dale Stephenson. "I don't know who Mad Hatters thought it was fooling, but I'm glad the whole charade is finally over. Seriously, that place was so gay, it practically had a sign out front. Stephenson, who cited the bar's interest in fashionable decor, its tidy appearance, and the fact that Madonna was always playing on the jukebox as "dead giveaways," wasn't alone in his suspicions. "I've only been to Mad Hatters a couple of times, but I always got the feeling that something weird was going on there," resident Frank Klein said. "One time I saw two guys kissing in the bathroom, but I somehow convinced myself that they were just drunk. Now that I think about it, though, the whole thing makes perfect sense. Since coming out, Mad Hatters has inspired other closeted businesses to reveal the truth about themselves, including an after-hours nightclub, two local parks, and 13 area hair salons. While proud of the difference his bar has made, Peterson said that his newly liberated gay business has been hurt by those closest to it. "As long Mad Hatters is under my roof, it'll do as I say," said financial investor and building landlord Michael Weinstein. "Either that damn bar gets its act together, or it can pack up and move out. No property of mine is going to turn out queer. Although many of the bars regulars transitioned easily into the new atmosphere, some have refused to have anything to do with Mad Hatters since the announcement. "Goddamn gay bars taking over everything," former patron Dennis Averill said upon hearing the news. "All I want is a normal bar where I can get a beer, watch the game, hang out with no one but men, and maybe get jerked off by a 19-year-old twink in a Dolce & Gabbana tank top before last call. Is that so much to ask?

Uninsured Man Hopes His Symptoms Diagnosed This Week On House
HAPEVILLE, GA — After being laid off last year from his door-fitting job at the local Ford Motor Company plant, uninsured 35-year-old Chris Thaney has been watching Fox's hit medical drama House to find out why he experiences severe headaches, an inability to urinate, sharp lower-back pains, and numbness on the left side of his body. "This week's episode had a guy who was close to having the same thing I have, but he was just the side patient who says the one thing that gets [Dr. Gregory] House to realize what is actually wrong with the episode's main patient," Thaney said. "The teaser for next week didn't give away much, but you never know. " Though Thaney's condition is deteriorating rapidly, he said he may quit watching the show if House does not shack up soon with that cute administrator whose name Thaney can never remember.

This Is The Point In The Blow Job Where I Have To Be Careful What I Say
Ordinarily, I am a candid, even verbose individual, but this is a particularly sensitive time for me, so I will try to remain brief. We have reached a juncture at which I, the recipient of this mind-blowing oral sex, must make some kind of statement that is both timely and appropriate. Unfortunately I am uncertain how to proceed. Clearly, I don't want this blow job to stop. This is a very delicate matter. Everything has been going fantastically, and the last thing I want to do is to spoil a particularly good blow job by saying the wrong thing. But what to say? Silence is not an option, since she's likely to take that as disapproval. Or even apathy. No, it's settled. I have to say something and I have to say something soon. It was so much easier at the beginning, when all that was required was a few moans here and there, and the occasional "ooh, yes. " The protocol was clearly defined, and we were both in a comfortable spot. Now, however, even the slightest ill-timed expletive could spoil it all. Therefore, I must aspire to be more guarded, more eloquent. I briefly considered going with "do it," but that sounds a touch derogatory, if not clichéd. She'd think that I was unoriginal or, worse yet, stupid. And who wants to fellate a dullard? Then there's always the well-worn positive-feedback route. I could wait until she does something noteworthy, and let her know it by saying, "Oh yeah, that's it. " But she actually might take that to mean the rest of it wasn't good, which is exactly the opposite of what I mean to convey. Or what if she feels like I'm giving her orders? I don't want her to think the guy she's fellating is some kind of domineering prick. I should compliment her. Somehow. "You give nice blow jobs" seems too formal. "You suck it so good" seems too cheap. After all, this is a lady. On the other hand, perhaps she likes that kind of thing. Who am I to judge? I should have asked her before we started. For God's sake — where was your head, Dan? Maybe something simple, like "You look beautiful with my penis in your mouth. " No, that just seems, well, inappropriate is one word. Why does getting sucked off have to be so complicated? I don't know how other men do it. It seems to come so naturally for the guys in the videos. I suppose I should play off our shared interests. I could sing a few bars of that song we both like! It would be kind of a shared musical experience. Oh, who am I kidding? I can't sing, and something from Jesus Christ Superstar is vastly inappropriate for this setting. I should have gone down on her first. That way there would be a set of mutually agreed-upon guidelines to follow. Time is quickly becoming a factor. Any minute she could look up at me expectantly, and if that happens, I'm liable to blurt out something completely irreparable. And if I freeze and say nothing, she might become plagued with self-doubt, thinking she's done something wrong. I could cut the tension with a joke, although I'm not very good at telling jokes, particularly when being orally serviced. Besides, I would probably lose my erection if she started laughing, and then where would I be? I'll just touch her head. But not without asking permission first. Or not. This could turn into an utter fiasco. I can't even count how many times perfectly good blow jobs have been ruined by a deficit of tact. I still haven't heard back from the woman to whom I unfortunately yelled, "Touchdown, Vikings!" And the time I tried out "Suck that creamsicle, suck it till it melts! " was misguided. I guess we all have our regrets. Wait, I think I may have it: It's ribald, but not obscene, with an edge of wit. Why didn't I think of it before? It's brilliant! Oh, Dan, you've outdone yourself this time. Okay. It's now or never. Well. I'm afraid that point is now moot. Dan Mulligan

Police Horrified By Grisly Remains Of Taco Bell Meal
TAMPA, FL — Local authorities were reportedly appalled and disgusted after discovering the brutalized remains of a Taco Bell meal strewn across a table at one of the fast-food chain's Tampa locations Monday. "The smell was awful — just awful," Tampa police officer Ken Burkett said after covering the mutilated, barely recognizable value meal with a napkin. "Someone really took their time with this one. We'll have to send it to the lab for analysis, but it appears that some of the remains are missing, possibly even eaten. Dear God." Though there are still no leads on who is responsible for the gruesome mess or what their motives may have been for entering the restaurant in the first place, police say they believe the incident occurred sometime between 1 and 2 a.m.

Hundreds Line Up Overnight For Opening Of New Homeless Shelter
SAN FRANCISCO — Traveling from as far away as park benches on the other side of town, hundreds of rabid temporary housing enthusiasts lined up overnight Friday in hopes of being among the first admitted to the city's newest homeless shelter. "I got here around 3 a.m., and already there was a crowd of people slumped over out front," said Jerome Ashford, a die-hard fan of having a roof over his head. "I had a feeling it was going to be popular, but this turnout — it's just insane. If I can't get in tonight, I don't know what I'll do. Since last Tuesday, men and women of all ages have left the familiar comforts of air-conditioned bus stations and ATM lobbies to brave the elements outside the much-anticipated Mission District shelter. While most arrive with nothing more than three partially smoked cigarettes and a slice of bologna wrapped in a handkerchief, others have come fully prepared for the long wait with shopping carts full of supplies. "I haven't been this excited since the bakery down the street threw out an entire trash bag of bagels," said Lawrence Jones, who took the week off from collecting aluminum cans and selling his plasma to a nearby blood bank to wait outside the shelter. "Sure, I haven't showered in a public fountain in days, and I miss the warmth of my alleyway back home, but in the end, it'll all be worth it. Although the prospect of sleeping outdoors for nothing more than the most basic of human necessities might seem extreme to some, many in attendance say they've been looking forward to the shelter's grand opening since first reading about it beneath a blanket of newspapers. "I started begging for subway fare the moment I heard the news," said Wendy Slovic, 41, adding that there was "no way" she could wait a couple of weeks for the crowds to thin out. "Say whatever you want, but I wouldn't trade my place in line for all the scratch tickets in the world. For some, the anticipation of lying on a cot or having three meals a day is so great that blacking out at night has become an almost impossible task. Still many others, who have been eagerly counting down the days since fishing an old wall calendar from a dumpster, can hardly put their growing elation into words. "Where is my soul, they took my soul away," said Michael "Bone" Zahn, who for the last week hasn't left his place at the front of the line even to use the restroom. "Broken windows like spiderwebs, a stone on a rocking chair, rain rain rain rain — begone, you cloth demons! Among the clamoring mass of refuge fanatics, the most devoted arrived early Sunday morning in full costume, including old shopping bags that had been fashioned into makeshift footwear and heavy ash-colored makeup covering their faces and hands. Some even carried a variety of creative signs with them. "Back when I started lining up to get into shelters, there were only 10 or 15 of us at most," said Samuel Robins, 63, gesturing at the teeming crowd of shelter enthusiasts on hand. "To see how far things have come in the last decade alone. It's unbelievable really. "Many of the kids here today weren't even alive when the first shelter was built on this street," Robins added. Despite the growing excitement, a number of mega-fans who have spent the last week sleeping in front of the shelter, and the week before that sleeping behind the shelter, said they are trying to keep their already high expectations in check. "I know it probably won't live up to the picture I have in my head, but it's still hard not to get your hopes up," harmonica musician Johnnie Brooklyn, 39, said. "You want it to be amazing — for there to be hot food on hand, maybe even hot water — but at the same time, you have to be realistic about these sorts of things. "Man, hot water would be nice, though," Brooklyn added. While the mob scene in front of the shelter has caused a few minor disruptions, including one incident in which a passerby was asked for spare change 143 consecutive times, only a handful of residents have reacted negatively to the swelling crowds. "To be honest, I feel sorry for them," said Beverly Sherman, an administrative coordinator for Wells Fargo Bank. "To have so little in your life that you think nothing of camping out on the streets for days on end — it's depressing. Added Sherman: "Seriously, these people need help.

Buoyant Force On Area Object Equal To Weight Of Water Displaced
BROWNSVILLE, AR — An area object partially immersed in a liquid was buoyed upward Tuesday by a force equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by that object, witnesses at the scene reported. According to sources, opposing forces acted against gravity during the displacement. In addition, though the object reportedly seemed lighter, it only appeared weightless due to the fact that the density of the liquid surrounding it was only slightly greater than that of the object. As of press time, the object is still maintaining positive buoyancy.

Fancy Man Enjoys Tea
YOUNGSTOWN, OH — Jason Baumer, a fancy little gent who is apparently too good to enjoy a regular cup of coffee, drank a cup of tea Sunday. The 29-year-old web designer prepared and consumed his precious tea, which is imported from some la-di-da foreign country, at about 10:30 a.m with the loving attention of a brittle, shawl-wearing spinster. "I normally have some Earl Grey in the morning," said Baumer, referring to a kind of tea named after a guy who used to run around England in a powdered wig and fruity tights. "Sometimes I have toast [and jam] too. Or just a bowl of cereal when I'm in a rush. Instead of simply heating a mug of water in the microwave, Baumer used a hoity-toity copper-bottomed tea kettle, which His Lordship reportedly purchased at Pier One Imports in 2003 for the express purpose of tea-making. Baumer's beverage is made with the use of a tea bag, a prissy little package of delicately scented, finely shredded leaves wrapped in a thin gauze and festooned with a bright yellow label tied to a string so that the user need not scald her tender digits in the hot water. Baumer, like all the other hens and dandies known to enjoy tea, must "steep" the drink, which is a term for gently lowering the bag into a teacup holding the hot water. On this occasion, Baumer removed the tea bag from the dainty brew and added one dollop of honey made by his friends the honeybees and a splash of milk straight from his mama's precious teat. But even with these additions, the tea was still too hot for Princess Jason's sensitive mouth, causing him to softly blow on the beverage with his lips pursed together like a little rosebud. "I like to do the crossword puzzle while I have my tea," said Baumer, making it easy to imagine him wearing a bonnet and a frilly pink dress. "Or listen to the radio. Our precious baby Baumer makes nearly daily use of his fragile porcelain teacup, which he balances between feeble thumb and forefinger to drink his beverage with prim sips. He often places the cup on a special little plate that goes with the cup. Baumer reportedly loves his tea so much that he knows about all the different kinds. He admitted to drinking a special type of tea at night called "chamomile," which is made out of pretty flowers. According to Baumer, the caffeine in regular tea robs him of his treasured beauty sleep if he drinks it too late in the day. Those close to the tea-sipper have known about Baumer's refined predilection for hot beverages for years, but shockingly have not ostracized him for it. "We sometimes have tea when we read the Sunday paper in bed," said Baumer's girlfriend, Laurel Altman, who would not comment on whether Baumer also stages tea parties with an assortment of dolls and teddy bears. Baumer, as wrapped up as he was in his special soothing drink for old maids, was nevertheless able to make it out to a local park later that morning in order to "enjoy the nice weather before it gets too cold.

It's Not Easy Being A Frotteur
I know what you're thinking: Surreptitiously rubbing one's crotch against nonconsenting women in crowded areas in order to achieve sexual arousal sounds like a walk in the park. But whenever I hear someone talking about how "simple" it must be to be a frotteur, I just have to laugh. Believe it or not, inconspicuous genital friction is not all fun and games. Contrary to popular belief, frottage takes hard work and dedication. Unlike building a deck or performing surgery, there are no instruction manuals on how to properly press your penis up against someone's hip on a packed train. These are things I had to teach myself. It takes a surprising amount of practice and a fair share of embarrassing failures in front of large groups of people to really get it right. Most people assume that frottage is as simple as dropping by any cramped or confined space, strolling up to the first unsuspecting female you see, and doing your thing. No way, José. If it were that easy, everyone would be a frotteur. In reality, you have to consider an almost endless number of variables before you can even think about enjoying the act of secretly stimulating yourself against a bystander's body: leverage, weight distribution, thickness of fabric, momentum — the list goes on. Paying attention to whether your target is carrying any foreign objects in her pockets is also paramount. Grinding your phallus against someone's keys is no fun at all, and barely arousing. But frottage is not just a science; it's also something of an art. There are certain intangibles that cannot simply be "learned" — like the ability to cup one's hand in a concave semicircle and tap the buttocks of the woman in front of you in such a rhythm that it simulates the unintentional contact of a swinging duffel bag. Not just anyone can pull off that level of furtive sexual pleasure. You've either got it or you don't. No one thinks about the hours and hours of preparation frottage takes, either. Every single day, I'm up at the crack of dawn to catch the crowded rush-hour train. I bet you're saying, "Hey, a lot of people do that. " Well, you try maintaining an erection at 8 a.m. without your morning coffee. Good luck. You also have to contend with factors such as the reshuffling of the crowd at each subway stop, hip-length messenger bags, women who don't tolerate someone vigorously gyrating against them, and a whole bunch of angular geometry that I don't even want to get into. Let's just say it sort of takes all the mystique out of groping. Now don't get me wrong, there are definitely parts of frottage that are truly rewarding. Like the feeling of your penis hardening as you thrust it into a nonconsenting woman's backside, and the part where you ejaculate in your pants. But there are downsides to frottage, too. Just the other day I was on the train with this beautiful creature in front of me. Everything's going smoothly: I'm leaning in at a nice 80-degree angle, got a good rhythm going, when all of a sudden, the woman starts screaming and hollering. Talk about a mood-killer. Of course, they end up stopping the whole train, so now everyone is mad at me, and I've got two policemen asking me all these personal questions. What a hassle! Sometimes I wonder why I keep doing this. It's getting to the point where it's almost impossible to engage in a little frottage without some big commotion. Gone is the golden age of frottage, when the trains would rumble and shake along bumpy tracks, each jostle and jolt sending one's genitals deeper and deeper into an unwitting passenger's side. And women who did realize what was happening would just stand there quietly against the wall while strange men used their stiff, motionless bodies as a means of sexual gratification. Those were the days! Sadly, modern train cars are more spacious, the rides are smoother, and people have changed. It's almost like the world is trying to make it harder for us frotteurs. My one hope in life is that people will someday see that frotteurs have it no easier than anyone else. The next time you're in a crowded subway and you feel something small and firm bumping against your lower back, it just might be one of us. So show a little respect and let the guy keep going until either he has finished up or it's your stop. Brian Shealy

Most Items At Garage Sale Haunted
CARBONDALE, PA — According to area bargain hunters, the majority of the dusty, cobweb-covered items at local resident Kelly Moore's garage sale Sunday appeared to possess supernatural qualities. "When I picked up that Ronco juicer, I felt a strange, ominous presence," said neighbor Lucinda O'Brien, who admitted that she could not pass up a deal on a Herb Alpert LP despite its having a "spooky aura" about it. "Mark my words, some very dark things went on involving most of this bric-a-brac. That green vase seems okay, but it has a crack in it. Moore said she's had relatively few complaints from her customers, though browser David Firth, 52, was reportedly torn limb from limb and had his heart devoured by Demogorgon, a demon from the seventh level of hell that had taken up residence inside a shoe tree.

Churchgoer Tips God For Excellent Week
CHARLESTON, SC — Churchgoer Brad Thaden, 48, reportedly tipped God a little something extra Sunday, claiming that the Almighty had done a better job than usual that week, especially with the weather and his children's behavior.

"If you keep it up, and make sure Mom doesn't have one of her spells at dinner on Wednesday, there's more where that came from. According to God, five dollars is "basically nothing" after He tips out the the priest, the pope, the altar boys, and the Holy Spirit.

Small Town Holds Annual Gay Shame Parade
GRAND PLAINS, NE — A tight-knit rural Midwestern farming community commemorated the demonization of homosexuality Sunday with its annual Gay Shame Parade, a three-decade-old tradition that has become a cornerstone of the town's cultural identity. "Every year, the whole town turns out to enjoy Nebraska's famous summer sunshine, sample foods, browse the craft bazaar, and shame homosexuals for their repulsive, decadent behavior," said Frank Mitchell, mayor of Grand Plains, NE and parade marshal. "This year was our biggest turnout yet. Everybody had so much fun ostracizing the gays. The parade featured the usual assemblage of police cruisers, fire trucks, antique cars, and farm equipment, which local residents had draped in red-white-and-blue banners that read "Burn in the Eternal Flames of Hell!" City Councilman Fred Brandeen, this year's "Jesus," entertained children by making mock finger-wagging gestures of admonishment and passing out buttons bearing the parade's traditional slogan: "NO!" Members of the Grand Plains Area Wives Association followed behind with a 15-foot hand-sewn banner, cosponsored by Jerry's Auto Body, which read: "GPAWA and Jerry's Cringe To Think What You're Putting Your Family Through." Organized every year by the Grand Plains City Council and a coalition of area churches, the Gay Shame Parade has been an annual event here since 1977, the year that citizens first became aware of gay people's existence. "To see a whole community rally together like this around a good cause — it's really an inspiration," said Ellen Lundblom, a mother of four enjoying the festivities with her youngest son, first-time reveler Timmy, 3. "If I were a lesbian, this would have really made me feel awful about myself. "My favorite part was the balloons," Timmy Lundblom said. "They had all different colors of angry frowny-faces on them. The event got off to a rousing start with the Grand Plains High School Cougars marching band playing such classics as "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "Onward, Christian Soldiers." The mood grew palpably more sober during the middle portion of the procession, as members of the Grand Plains Baptist Church marched with folded arms in stony, judgmental silence and stared at the spectators lining the streets as if to ask, "Are you gay? The spirit of levity returned, however, toward the parade's finish, which featured balloon giveaways, a float contest, and an appearance by 6-year-olds Christopher Weiland and Courtney Wendt, who were crowned "Junior Mister and Miss Heterosexual" on Saturday. The parade concluded with a group reading of Leviticus 20:13. After the last bit of confetti fell, spectators praised the parade's highlights, including a float, presented by local Little League team the Tigers that depicts a mother, sitting alone with her head down on a kitchen table, crying. The first-place ribbon went to "Sodom and Gomorrah," a miniature version of the two Biblical cities engulfed in flames. The float's designer, McPhee's Department Store window dresser Bruce Carlson, was not able to accept his prize, however, as he was away visiting an aunt in Lawrence, KS for the weekend. Despite the pageantry, parade organizers stressed that the event has a serious message. "Everyone loves a parade," PTA chairwoman Agatha Buell said. "But it's about a lot more than the clowns, the decorations, and those Shriner fellows in their tiny cars. It's about making folks feel sickened by the deviant homosexual lifestyle, like God wants us to. Spectators couldn't help but be delighted by the parade's surprise finale, when, after dutifully leading the marching band for the entire mile-long parade route, local music teacher Colin Atherton was marched past the county line and told never, ever to return.

Imaginary Brain Tumor Spreading Rapidly
CUMBERLAND, MD — Independent bookstore cashier Jay Graham has an imaginary brain tumor that is quickly spreading through his body and will ultimately reach his lungs, kidneys, and bones unless he receives treatment immediately. "I knew it was a tumor several days ago when my headache lingered even after I took two aspirin," Graham said of the imaginary growth, which he estimated to be "approximately the size of a cantaloupe," despite the lack of any noticeable swelling in and around his cranial area. "Yesterday I'm pretty sure it broke into two tumors, one of which I think is behind my left eye, since I noticed some slight blurring in my vision two minutes ago. I can't have much time left. Sources close to Graham remain confident he will pull through, citing the fact that he has already survived two imaginary cardiac arrests, three imaginary embolisms, and at least five cases of exposure to imaginary weaponized anthrax.

Construction Worker Still Hasn't Given Up On True Love
NEW YORK — Veteran New York City construction worker Lonnie Barbierri may, on the exterior, seem like the tough-guy type. But as any woman who has ever strolled past a building site where he was working can attest, under that rough exterior lies a sensitive side. No matter how busy he is, Barbierri always takes time to make sure the ladies know that he is interested, available, and ready for romance. And though he remains single after countless attempts to meet that special someone, Barbierri still believes that true love is within his grasp. "A lot of guys are afraid to make themselves vulnerable by revealing their emotions, but when I meet someone I'm interested in, I express how I feel — usually by saying something like 'Hey! You want a piece of this?' " said Barbierri, grabbing his crotch, grunting, and rhythmically thrusting his pelvis forward. "I figure you've got to put yourself out there. If you can't open up to a woman, she'll never have any way of knowing how much you want to give her the high hard one. "Deep down, I'm just a hopeless romantic," he added. Calling every woman special in her own way, Barbierri explained that he always tries to touch upon the individual qualities of each woman he greets. For example, if she happens to be drinking something through a straw, he'll ask if she wants something else to suck on. If she seems to be in a hurry, he'll ask where the fire is, and then subtly suggest that it may be, in fact, in his pants. And if her nipples are visibly poking through her shirt, he'll inquire if she is cold, and gallantly offer to warm those beauties up for her. "If I see a great pair of cans, I say so," said Barbierri, working on the twelfth floor of a future condominium complex on Manhattan's Upper East Side. "Who knows? She could be the one, and if I let my shyness get in the way, I might miss out forever on the chance to meet the girl of my dreams. I don't want to go through the rest of my life wondering whether fries do come with that shake. Despite Barbierri's disarming friendliness, personal warmth, and inviting "Sit on My Face" chest tattoo, virtually no women pedestrians are receptive to him. In fact, on the day Barbierri was interviewed, the female passersby invariably increased their pace, stared silently ahead, and avoided eye contact with the ironworker. To Barbierri's credit, he didn't let the string of rejections derail his positive outlook. "The right girl — the one who'll one day slice me off a serving of that sweet stuff and bring it straight home to Daddy — is out there, somewhere," he said. "New York's a big town, you know? And as long as I keep yelling 'nice rack' at all the hot pieces of ass out here on the sidewalk, I have faith that one of them will respond. Maybe even flash me the cooze. And despite his traditional Italian Catholic upbringing, Barbierri has never been one to allow race, creed, or color to stand in the way of his appreciation of beauty. "Hey, check out the Asian broad with the briefcase! " he said, spotting another potential life partner. "I wouldn't mind feeding her some beef chow mein, know what I'm saying? Yo, Tokyo Rose! You speakee dee Engrish? Me love you long time, baby! Yet Barbierri doesn't base his judgments on surface appearances. Though admitting that some women whom he initiates contact with are "not that hot," all women, he said, have something about them that is beautiful. "I don't care if she's a triple-bagger — everybody deserves a compliment now and then," he said. "That's the God-honest truth. Besides, some of the ugly ones might still have great legs, or a hot ass. Just because their faces could stop a train, that don't mean they can't give great head or appreciate a hot beef injection. It remains to be seen whether Barbierri, who turned 47 in April, will ever meet his soul mate. But if his optimism and enthusiasm provide an insight into his true character, Barbierri is quite the catch. "The important thing is to keep the lines of dialogue open," he said. "With women, communication is everything.

Murder Mystery On Train Not So Fun In Real Life
TOMAH, WI — An ongoing murder investigation aboard a cross-country Amtrak passenger train has not been the thrilling, suspense-filled journey of intrigue and ingenious subterfuge that was initially anticipated, travelers said Monday. "It seemed like an open and shut case," said accountant Louis Simms, one of 129 passengers aboard the train. "No arcane clues or cryptic poetry or 'perfect crime' aspirations or anything. A guy got into a fight and got stabbed. The victim, identified by police as 34-year-old Paul Satterwhite, was found dead of multiple stab wounds in the dining car of the Empire Builder in the early morning hours of Monday, nearly two hours after the train's departure from Chicago. Passenger excitement upon the discovery of the slaying was soon dashed when local police dispatched to the scene decided to hold the Oregon-bound train outside the small rural community of Tomah indefinitely. "I can't believe they stopped the train at the next crossing," telemarketer Joe Stimpson said. "I thought this sort of thing was supposed to slowly unfold while we were still moving, not drag on forever in some middle-of-nowhere cornfield. A sort of confused monotony defined the next several hours, as bleary-eyed passengers were first ordered off the train and crowded into Tomah's tiny train station, then put back on again when concerns about flight risk on the part of the still-unknown perpetrator were voiced. The police, reportedly inexperienced with murder investigations, again removed the passengers when it was determined that the crime scene had not been properly secured. The arrival of FBI agents shortly after sunrise prompted a stir of excitement among the travelers, but this was quickly suppressed when they were ordered back on the train and told to remain in their seats. Because this meant that no one but people carrying badges was allowed to sleuth, several passengers questioned whether proper police procedure was being conducted. "How are we supposed to gauge one another's reaction to the murder if we're not all allowed to crowd around the body at once? " dental assistant Lynn Gallen said. "Who's going to solve the mystery if plucky amateurs are not allowed to snoop around and spot clues the professionals are too dull and complacent to notice? "Anyhow, I heard the guy was stabbed with an ordinary switchblade, not something cool like a rare Mayan obsidian dagger," Gallen continued. Many also expressed a strong dislike of the lead investigator on the case, Agent Bernard Larson. "That man has got to be the least memorable person alive," electrician Raymond Mercado said. "He has no interesting quirks or foibles, looks neither eccentrically shabby nor fastidiously dapper. He doesn't even smoke. And he wasn't coincidentally on the train when the murder happened, either. They just brought him in later. Passengers also criticized the repetitive questioning by police, the lack of verbal updates about the situation, and the fact that the body had been discovered out in the open and hadn't tumbled from a luggage rack or been crammed into a large steamer trunk. While several bald, middle-aged fat men were present on the train, none are reported to have worn black suits or carried bass fiddles. Riders were further let down when, by midday, Chicago resident Nathan Van Dyck, 28, was taken into custody. A kitchen worker reported seeing Van Dyck heatedly arguing with the victim shortly before the body was discovered. According to police, Satterwhite was a divorced auto mechanic who allegedly lacked a shadowy past involving deceit, murder, and treachery that would have motivated an act of violent retribution. Nor did Satterwhite and Van Dyck appear to share any apparent dark secrets. Even the resolution of the case left travelers cold, as Van Dyck's arrest enabled the train to resume the journey without incident. While most dozed, a few returned to their knitting, Sudoku puzzle books, and mystery novels. "This whole experience hasn't been the least bit fun or fascinating," podiatrist Floyd Rose said. "In fact, I'm starting to think what happened here was kind of awful and scary. A few expressed disappointment that the only somewhat interesting passenger, an impeccably dressed gentleman with an eye patch and a German accent, hadn't been seen on the train since he was spotted leaving the dining car shortly after the murder was thought to have occurred.

Heroic Man Rushes Into Movie Theater, Saves 4 Seats
KING OF PRUSSIA, PA — In what eyewitnesses are calling a "selfless display of true courage," moviegoer Michael N. Kincaid, 39, rushed headlong into an empty cineplex Monday to save four seats for the 7:35 p.m. showing of Live Free or Die Hard. Shoving a group of teenaged girls and an elderly couple out of the way, the quick-thinking Kincaid scattered various personal items across the four seats, then commandeered a fifth for himself. "Mike sacrificed his own place in line at the snack counter to save these seats for me, Diane, Shelly from work, and Diane's boyfriend," said friend Colin Edward, who was in the men's room at the time. "We shall not soon forget his deeds this day. Kincaid downplayed the episode, saying that he just did what anyone would have done if they had been the one chosen to save seats.

Modern-Day Martin Luther Nails 95 Comment Cards To IHOP Door
SIOUX FALLS, SD — Managers of an area International House of Pancakes discovered 95 comment cards nailed to its front door Sunday, which were later identified as the work of local resident Ronald Lyman, a 53-year-old contractor and onetime regular customer who is calling for wide-scale reform of the venerable chain. "IHOP has grown weak on powdered sugar and fruity garnishes, forsaking the righteousness of its original rib-sticking mission," said Lyman, who nailed his 95 comments to the door shortly before the morning brunch rush, when they would receive maximum exposure. "This house is no longer a house of pancakes — it is a house of lies. Lyman's 95 cards assail IHOP for what he perceives to be an "unholy alliance" of the sweet and the savory, a dangerously narrowing blueberry-to-batter ratio, hard-to-open butter packets, and an increasingly tall short stack. Fifteen cards alone attack the excessive breadth of syrup selection. "IHOP is about pancakes, not syrups," card 41 reads. "No pancake can exist drowned in a pool of lingonberry. No man who comes hungry can leave happy on artificial orange-flavored goo. Lyman said that his pancake fundamentalism is based on "the trinity of griddle-fried batter, butter, and maple syrup, as directed by our breakfast elders more than two score years ago. " His beliefs were forged by years of increasing dissatisfaction with the "internationalist" influence within IHOP, which he said stresses flavor over substance. "The course of my life changed last week when a waitress dropped a tray and I was struck with hot coffee," Lyman said. "As I wiped my eyes and opened them, suddenly I became aware of the full extent of the corruption. Sweet crepes mingling with egg runoff. The sickening decadence of Belgian waffles. A waitstaff more concerned with lining their pockets with tips than with dedicating their lives to service. I stormed from the wicked place without settling my bill, finally realizing what I must do: devote my life to bringing down the House of Pancakes. To bring it down, then build it anew in righteousness and customer satisfaction. IHOP manager Dennis Ryskowski said that he has tried to read some of Lyman's comments during his breaks, but has so far only made it to card 26, "On the Blankets of Pigs." "We welcome all customer suggestions and feedback," Ryskowski said. "That's why we provide the comment cards. I do, however, wish Mr. Lyman had simply placed his in the box by the host station instead. Several customers who had come to the restaurant after bars closed Sunday night agreed with Lyman's stand, saying they, too, often feel disconnected from the IHOP experience. "I really like what he has to say about returning to the basics," customer Kelly Grabler said. "Sometimes you just want a nice fat stack of pancakes, but you end up overwhelmed by the choices. Lots of the stuff isn't even breakfast. An IHOP meal should be a straightforward relationship between an individual and some pancakes. Card 63 perhaps most eloquently summarizes Lyman's condemnatory stance. "These steep and serene blue roofs, which arc to the heavens, in truth house corrupt souls who once sought succor in a simple pancake, but have now succumbed to the temptation of caramel cheesecakes and Caesar salads," Lyman wrote. "Only by returning to its hearty breakfast roots can IHOP save itself and its customers. Lyman suggested that, should his recommended changes not be instituted, he will have no choice but to break with the restaurant and start his own International House of Pancakes, Reformed (IHOPR) off I-229 by the airport.

Is This The Mattress Showroom From The Commercial?
Someone pinch me. Harder! Am I mistaken, or is this the mattress showroom made famous on all those TV commercials? If I stand right here and I turn my head from left to right, it should be just like I'm the camera in the "Memorial Day Spectacular" spot. Oh my God, it is! This is it. I'm really actually standing in the largest mattress showroom in the quad-county area. So this is where all the magic happens. I bet most people never get to see behind the scenes of a high-profile mattress wholesaler and factory outlet. Although I've got to admit, this showroom looks a lot smaller in person. I'm surprised that they can hold the state's largest selection of mattresses and sleeper sofas in a space this size, but I guess it makes the feat even more impressive. Look at the fluorescent lighting, the carpets, the decorations, the signs on the headboards here. Man, there's got to be at least 20 years of commercial history within these walls, from St. Patrick's Day blowouts to Thanksgiving Day closeouts. There's a $599 price tag, just like the one good old Don the Mattress King tore to pieces in the "Attack of the Price Slasher" spot in 1999. And I knew those trucks in the parking lot looked familiar from somewhere, but it just hit me: They starred in the "Free Delivery Fridays" promotion all through the summer of 2005! Isn't that the mattress from the Independence Day "Independence from High Mattress Prices Sale" commercial? The one where the owner's children bounced on the bed dressed like the Statue of Liberty and Uncle Sam? Those kids probably have no idea now, but they are going to look back in a decade and realize just how lucky they were. Imagine spending your childhood hanging out in the real live mattress showroom that's advertised on television every single day. Oooooh! This is new. I haven't seen these streamers on the ads before. Unless — oh my God — are they shooting a commercial right now? That would make my life. Everyone back home would absolutely lose it if I told them I saw a mattress showroom commercial being filmed up close. I'm sure I'd be telling that story to everyone I met until the day I died. But I don't see any cameras or anyone in any costumes, so I guess I jumped the gun. Too bad. I should have known they'd wait until after hours to film a commercial so they don't get all sorts of oddballs in the background. Man, it'd be such a thrill to be one of the guys lying on a mattress in one of the commercials. They must be professional actors, though, to keep up with the Mattress King. Wait — is he here? Is Don the Mattress King actually here, practically giving away mattresses? Yes! There he is. Wow. I am such a big fan, but I don't want to bother him. He's probably being approached by fans all the time. I don't want to be one of those guys — but when am I going to get another chance? Mr. Garbelli! I'm sorry to disturb you while you're selling such a high volume of mattresses, but I am a huge fan of you and all your work. I've seen every commercial you've made ever since you were the sponsor of "Queen Ghoulie's Late Night Fright Film" back in the '80s. I've always looked up to you, and I think my girlfriend's got a little crush on you. It's a dream come true to finally meet you. What? Oh. Well, I'm actually not in the market for any new bedding right now. I know you advise people not to come to the warehouse unless they're ready for the deal of their lives, but I'm actually pretty happy with my current mattress. But can I get a picture with you? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey look, buddy, just because I already have a decent mattress doesn't mean you have to be a dick. Man. That guy used to be so cool. I guess all the fame must've gone to his head.

Strip Poker Ends Solemnly With Scar Explanation
CONRAD, MT — The laughter and giddy sexual tension that typically accompanies a game of strip poker ended abruptly Monday after player Sarah Garrison removed her shirt and revealed a vicious scar that prompted innocent yet ill-advised questioning from the three other participants. "I guess she was 9 when it happened," said playing partner Justin Kiefel, who described the scar as jagged, densely fibrous, and extending from her navel all the way to her collarbone. "Her uncle was drunk and prone to Vietnam flashbacks, and had been playing with his knife, and, uh, I don't want to say any more. " Kiefel said that after about 30 seconds of shocked silence, everyone started putting their clothes back on.

Garage Orchestra Hands Out Demo At Boston Philharmonic Show
BOSTON, MA — The 104 members of the upstart Melrose Philharmonic Orchestra of Melrose, MA stood outside Jordan Hall Sunday and passed out demo CDs to the crowd exiting a Boston Philharmonic performance of Prokofiev's Symphony No. 6 In E-Flat Minor. "Hey, you like orchestral? " said third cellist Paul Gleiberman as he thrust copies of the recording at visibly bemused concertgoers. "We've been meeting in my conductor friend's four-car garage every Tuesday, and we're getting pretty tight. There's some Mahler, a Mozart, our choir buds helped us out with the Morten Lauridsen — we go all over the place. You should check it out. It's good. " The orchestra was told to move across the street by Sanders Hall management, who said that it was blocking several fire exits.

Distracted Priest Pronounces Couple 'Man And Plumbing Problem'
COLUMBUS, OH — Father Gerald Reamer mistakenly pronounced groom Danny Colm and bride Rachael Hall "man and plumbing problem" during their wedding ceremony at the First Episcopalian Church yesterday. "We are gathered here today to witness the eternal union of these two faulty flush valves," said Reamer, urging anyone who objected to the nuptials of Mr. and Mrs. Colm to speak now or forever wait for the repairman to show up. "You may now kiss the outdated, thoroughly rusted iron pipes. " Several guests attending the wedding reported that, immediately following the ceremony, Reamer bolted down the aisle and jumped into the couple's waiting limo, saying that he had to get home because he forgot to turn off his in sickness and in health.

Area Pagan Dreading Big Family Vernal Equinox Celebration
MEDFORD, OR — Despite evidence that the planets are aligned in his favor, local pagan Jeff Birch, 27, said Monday that he would "rather have a peaceful weekend at home" than attend his family's Vernal Equinox celebration on March 21. "I realize it's supposed to be a festive time of conception and new growth in the womb of Mother Earth and all," Birch said. "But I just know that within an hour of arriving, things will get so bad that I'll be reverting to my 12-year-old self, hiding in the rec room downstairs, wearing my Iroquois false face mask and fingering my runes for comfort. It's not worth it. "Anyway, wasn't I just back home for Mabon?" Birch added. Most pagans look forward to marking the Vernal Equinox, when the hours of sunlight equal the hours of darkness. Yet for some, like Birch, this sacred springtime celebration of balance and harmony means contending with family infighting and undue stress. "Talking to Mom the other day, it was the same old manipulative 'You're coming home, right?' " said Birch, referring to a recent phone conversation with his mother, Freyja Birch. "If I hesitate for even a second, she piles on the guilt — like how this may be the last year Nana Hippolyta can perform the garden fertility ritual, or that without my masculine energy, the yin-and-yang balance will be thrown off — until I finally give in. "But I don't want to have to use up my vacation time and travel almost 300 miles to Portland just to listen to Grandma Moon Odin Rhiannon complain during the sunrise ritual that Mom's not putting enough rose petals in the cauldron or is letting the bonfire get too low," Birch continued. "That will just set Mom off bitching at Grandma for constantly trying to undermine her spiritual relationship with the Pagan Goddess of Dawn and then no one will speak to each other until nightfall. Birch said he has little sympathy for his perfectionist mother, who reportedly tries to do too much and invites too many people. He says she is known to spend countless hours weaving thistle wreaths and sun-drying her own currants for hot cross buns in preparation for the Equinox. "It's hard to feel sorry for her when things don't go exactly according to her elaborate, impossible plans," Birch said. "And she knows better than to invite Aunt Isolde, who always has too much mulled mead and starts moaning about the lack of a good high priest in her life. Besides the usual maiden-mother-crone conflicts, the strained relationship between Birch's sister, Pythia, who recently converted to Wicca, and his father, a devout Dionysian, is another source of tension, according to Birch. "Last year, Pythia brought her covenmate home, and Dad's still having a hard time with it," Birch said. "It's obvious that he doesn't approve of her lifestyle. He's always asking her why doesn't she find a nice warlock to settle down with, or telling her maybe what she really needs is a good old-fashioned bacchanalia. Are other pagan families like this? Pythia isn't the first family member to stray from the fold. Fifteen years ago, Birch's uncle Jack married a Presbyterian and has raised two children in the faith. While he is still included in family celebrations, his eccentric monotheism is the source of much awkwardness, Birch said. Two years ago, the black-sheep uncle almost didn't get invited back. "Having a celestial deity worshipper in our home angered the Goddess Eostre and she punished us with an April freeze," Birch said. "My mom was barely able to salvage her herb garden. Of all the unpleasant experiences, however, Birch said he dreads the "inevitable" questions about his love life most. "My folks can't wrap their heads around the idea that a man in his late twenties isn't handfasted yet and is okay with it," Birch said. "There's always some new Church of the Sacred Pentacle virgin or a cute single witch from the last Full Moon ritual who they just have to set me up with. While he treasures happy memories of Vernal Equinoxes from his childhood, Birch said he comes away from today's holidays a few pounds heavier from the rich holiday food, several hundred dollars in debt from buying gifts "that will probably just get returned or regifted at Samhain anyway," and reeling from a fresh family conflict bound to last for months or years. "I just have to learn how to say no," Birch said. "Maybe I'll skip Beltane this year. I want to lose some weight and work on my six-pack before Summer Solstice."

Boyfriend Ready To Take Relationship To Previous Level
COLUMBIA, SC - Following a romantic three-day getaway to South Carolina's Hilton Head Island, 32-year-old Matthew Sullivan said he is now "more ready than ever" to take his 10-month relationship with girlfriend Carol Moag to the previous level. "After spending every waking moment with Carol for 72 hours, I know in my heart that I'm prepared to see her face twice, maybe even once a week," said Sullivan, who met Moag, 34, at a friend's New Year's party in January. Sullivan claimed he has been considering "taking the big leap backward" since Moag suggested last month that the two get a cat. The weekend of uninterrupted intimacy served to erase whatever reservations Sullivan may still have held about the move. "I know this is a big decision, but I'm ready for it," said Sullivan as he picked up a few DVDs and books he had left at Moag's apartment before she returned home from work. "I've given this a lot of thought, and whenever I imagine giving Carol the keys to her place back, it just feels right. "I'm so excited about this," he added. Though Sullivan admitted being initially nervous about Moag's reaction to the sudden announcement, he said he was confident that she will, if not right away, eventually see that his instincts are correct. "I'm not sure she'll be ready to take the plunge like this," Sullivan said. "But if I give her plenty of space and lots and lots of time by herself to think it through, she'll realize that we're meant to be together a lot less. Sullivan said he hoped the couple's new lowered level of commitment will provide them an opportunity to grow as individuals and really make the relationship work for Sullivan. "It isn't going to be easy, but no one wants this more than I do," said Sullivan, who believes that his clarity at this important juncture is a direct sign of his advanced maturity. "As you get older, you recognize what's really important to you," Sullivan said. "When I made the decision to get a lot less serious with Carol, I just felt this sense of peace. I can tell by the look in her eyes — that loving, longing gaze — that I must act now before I miss my chance. Sullivan said that he is continually surprised by how "time just flies by" in his relationship with Moag. The 32-year-old said he has a gut sense that if he does not make her aware of his feelings soon, it will be too late. "What happens now will determine the rest of our future together," said Sullivan, who claimed that he did not want to repeat the mistakes he made in previous long-term relationships. "The last woman I was with [ex-wife Maria Heller], I let this moment pass me by, and I'll always regret it. "I ended up living with her for two and half years," Sullivan added.

Former Marine Sniper Slapped With 3,000-Yard Restraining Order
MACON, GA — Citing Emily Holman's right to feel safe traversing vast open spaces, especially when within visual range of clock towers, parking structures, and tall buildings, a judge awarded the 28-year-old a 3,000-yard restraining order yesterday against her former boyfriend, retired Marine sniper Gordon Lee Blackwood. "When we broke up he started calling me 10 times a day from his job," said Holman, who realized Blackwood's office building, which had an open, flat roof, was only 1,800 yards away. "He had me flinching every time I saw sunlight glinting off any surface within two and a half miles. " Blackwood would not comment on the judge's decision, saying only that he still loved Holman and was trying to understand the distance and crosswinds that separated them.

Specters Of Dental Hygienists Past Haunt Convention Center
SPOKANE, WA — More than one dozen attendees of a drapery and window coverings trade show at the local Comfort Inn and Convention Center last weekend reported seeing ghostly manifestations of dental hygienists from conventions long forgotten. "Wispy, milky shapes streaking past the veggie platters on the buffet tables, a faint odor of mouthwash, the sound of saliva suction machines coming from seemingly empty rooms — very spooky stuff," said Rich Vitanza, a Chicago-based salesman for Hunter Douglas Window Fashions, on Monday. "It was enough to chill you to the bone, or at least make you floss regularly. Similar reports have been commonplace at the Spokane Comfort Inn, which began hosting an annual dental hygienists convention in the 1970s. The first instances of supernatural dental hygiene–related activity, including the unexplained disappearances of sugary sweets from reception desks and room service breakfasts, began in the early 1980s. "Once a week, like clockwork, a guest comes to the concierge desk and says that when he awoke, a new toothbrush was sitting on the edge of the bathroom sink, covered in a fresh coat of toothpaste," said desk manager Greg Meacham, who claimed he received phantom dental sealants on two occasions. "Last month, the words 'Have your teeth cleaned every six months by a licensed oral-health professional' were projected onto the screen in the main ballroom during a luncheon. Thing is, the projector wasn't even plugged in at the time. Over the years, guests have seen flickering lights in the hotel's stairway exposing what appeared to be X-rays of bicuspids, and paper spit cups arranged in elaborate geometrical patterns in the elevators. A few even reported being awoken in the middle of the night by the icy-cold touch of a gloved hand on their gums. "I was cleaning my face, just about to reach over for my towel, when I heard a voice complaining about the Waterpik being no substitute for brushing," said Charlotte, NC resident Linda Matthie, who was a guest at the Comfort Inn during the Christmas holiday. "Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a woman in a pastel outfit, but when I turned to look at her, she was gone. "Yes, Evelyn's practically an old friend of ours now," said desk manager Meacham, referring to one of the most well-known ghosts. "The legend goes that she died of an aneurysm while attending a convention here. She's known to roam the halls, her yearning for proper oral hygiene forever unsated. Meacham said he advises all visitors to expect chillingly banal conversations about the weather and children's soccer games to echo through the halls, though he reassures guests that the eerie smooth jazz music that often terrifies visitors originates from the hotel's public-address system. Paranormal investigator Richard Schmidt said that the hardworking, serious-minded hygienists haunting the convention center are merely yearning for the camaraderie and educational opportunities they so treasured in their earthly lives. "Dental hygiene meant everything to them," Schmidt said. "Their spirits linger here to learn about advances in tooth-whitening technology for all eternity — and to remember good times. Recent plastics trade show–attendee Jonathan Storff said that a stay at the Comfort Inn need not be a frightening experience. "Oh, I don't pay much attention to all the fuss," Storff said. "My stay here was pretty uneventful, anyway, but my toothache is gone, my breath tastes minty fresh, and my smile has never been brighter.

Brunch Livened Up By Jazz Trio's Violent Breakup
SAN FRANCISCO — An ordinary Sunday afternoon brunch at Café Cleo was enlivened by an explosive physical exchange between members of jazz band Everywhere/Nowhere, which ended with saxophonist Dave Jeremy storming out of the eatery. "I was just sitting there eating my eggs Benedict with tempeh hash browns, and all a sudden the music stopped and I heard this loud 'crack' and a spit-covered mouthpiece whizzed past my head," said local silk-screen artist Sarah Wang, who was dining with poet Jenna Nowler and playwright James Lewis. "Not only did the jazz stop for a while, we also had something to talk about besides James' new one-act." After the breakup, the two remaining members of Everywhere/Nowhere played a 30-minute drum-and-bass version of "My Funny Valentine."

Scavenger-Hunt Party 'Not Leaving Without Twine'
PORTAGE, MI — A scavenger-hunt team dispatched to the Moorsbridge neighborhood continues to occupy the Dean and Nicole Mullikan residence, and has announced plans to remain until the couple releases a length of twine needed to complete the list given out at Taylor Keim's birthday party. "We've gotten this far, and we're not leaving without the twine," said Joshua Hebert, 11, the leader of a trio of fifth graders who have been engaged in the diligent search since late Monday afternoon. "These people live in a town that recycles. What do they use to bundle their newspapers and cardboard? They need to look harder. " Hebert and his partners said they remain confident that the homeowners will soon "come to their senses," like the older lady at 236 Wilton Terrace who finally turned up three red buttons after a two-hour standoff.

Republicans Blame Election Losses On Democrats
WASHINGTON, DC — Republican officials are blaming tonight's GOP losses on Democrats, who they claim have engaged in a wide variety of "aggressive, premeditated, anti-Republican campaigns" over the past six-to-18 months. "We have evidence of a well-organized, well-funded series of operations designed specifically to undermine our message, depict our past performance in a negative light, and drive Republicans out of office," said Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman, who accused an organization called the Democratic National Committee of spearheading the nationwide effort. "There are reports of television spots, print ads, even volunteers going door-to-door encouraging citizens to vote against us. " Acknowledging that the "damage has already been done," Mehlman is seeking a promise from Democrats to never again engage in similar practices.

New Therapist Obsessed With Old Therapist
STONE HARBOR, NJ — Dr. Peter Crosley, the psychotherapist seen by real-estate broker Rachel Falbaum since March, has become increasingly focused on the thoughts and techniques of Dr. Seth Hirschfeld, Falbaum's therapist from the summer of 2001 until this spring. "Going back to your sister, whom you seem to believe is more successful: How did your therapist feel about her? " said Crosley to Falbaum during a session Monday. "Would you describe your feelings towards his discussions of her as resentment? Because it's quite revealing if this guy never asked about your sister. I certainly wonder how that might make me feel. " For her part, Falbaum said that her sessions with Crosley have helped her to view her former therapist in a different light, one which will "definitely" enable her to move on to new therapy.

Don Knotts, Richard Pryor Team Up For Madcap Haunting
ESCONDIDO, CA — The ghosts of comedy legends Don Knotts and Richard Pryor were embroiled in a madcap misadventure Monday, which involved crooks, a missing diamond, and an old fixer-upper mansion haunted by the late actors. The escapade, characterized by the ectoplasmic pair as "cockamamie" and "crazy-ass bullshit," began early last month, when the spirits of Knotts and Pryor separately took up residence at the old Mayweather place, a 20-room mansion that sits atop a hill on the edge of town. After a long and protracted episode in which the easily frightened ghosts circled the dining room, continually missing each other by a split-second, they finally came face-to-face, only to mutually scream in horror. "I yelled out, 'A spook! A spook!' " the ghost of Knotts said. "And Richard said, 'Who you callin' a spook, honky?' So I said, 'But — but — but look at you, you're as pale as a ghost!' And Richard said, 'Now I'm pale? Make up your mind, whitey!' Knotts' ghost added: "It went on like that for a while, until I learned not to say things that Richard interpreted as racist. Over the next several days, the unlikely duo were scared by such innocuous things as shadows cast by coatracks, a billowing curtain, and a mouse. In mid-April, the Patterson family of Van Nuys, CA, moved into the Mayweather Mansion. Don Patterson, who had inherited the forgotten property from an eccentric and wealthy great-aunt, said that he thought it would be exciting to live in a big house, but soon regretted his decision to move when he saw its dilapidated condition. "Ever since we moved into this crazy old shack, all kinds of fishy things have been happening," said Patterson, 47, a gruff, pragmatic certified public accountant. "Like the other day, I could have sworn I set a bucket of whitewash on the floor of the parlor, but when I opened the door, the dang thing spilled all over my head. But I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of this. Besides their mischevious antics, the two specters have also had a positive impact. Besides helping Duncan, the bowl-cut-wearing 7-year-old son come out of his shell, they also devised a lighthearted scheme to help daughter Marley, 15, get on the high-school cheerleading squad. And, most astonishingly, while the terrified Knotts was running from a raccoon through the house's walls, he stumbled upon a glittering, 150-carat stone: the famed Starbright Diamond. "I tried to grab the diamond, but my hand just went through it," the Ghost of Pryor said. "A brother can't even get ahold of some bread when he's dead! Early Monday morning, accused serial burglars Hugo Gross and Bobby Lee Shively, who had the only map detailing the diamond's location, invaded the home to retrieve the precious jewel. Young Duncan happened upon the burglars and was bound and gagged. The Ghosts of Knotts and Pryor, who were awakened by Duncan's muffled screams, snuck up on the criminals and scared them into giving up the diamond. "One fell right through that trapdoor the father kept forgetting about and falling through earlier, and another one backed up into a hot stove, among numerous other shenanigans," the Ghost of Knotts said. Finally, a sagging piece of roof caved in and knocked the robbers unconscious, and Escondido police officers soon arrived and arrested them. The Patterson family now owns the Starbright Diamond, and plans to use money from its sale to renovate the mansion. Yet Patterson refused to believe that ghosts were responsible for stopping the caper. "I tell you, there's no such thing as ghosts," Patterson said. "And the idea of a dead African-American comedian influencing my behavior is absolutely ridiculous. Why, I probably acquired my new swagger and improved lovemaking abilities from watching the MTV with my daughter. The Knotts and Pryor Ghosts said they will continue haunting the Mayweather Mansion, and plan to follow up the daffy caper with a sequel, unless their old comedy partners, Tim Conway and Gene Wilder, become ghosts themselves first.

Area Man Finally Works Up Courage To Sexually Harass Secretary
EASTTOWN, PA — After seven years of prolonged glances and unsatisfied desires, Scott Winters, assistant vice president for Basin Financial, threw caution to the wind Monday, finally declaring his feelings and intentions for secretary Anna Davis through a series of suggestive gestures, inappropriate remarks, and anatomically exaggerated drawings. "I cannot tell you what a relief it is to finally get this off my chest," said Winters, 53. "Every morning while I'd stare at her through the blinds in my office for an hour at a time, my pulse would race thinking of all the things I wanted to say to her about her tight blouse. But I could just never find the words." Winters, who had "never believed in lust at first sight," said he had nonetheless been infatuated with Davis, 32, since he first laid eyes on her cleavage soon after he hired her in 1999. So intense was Winters' fixation with Davis that over time it began to negatively affect his job performance. According to Winters, his inability to provide Davis with even the most brief description of his wife's oral-sex technique "seriously frustrated" him and made it difficult to focus on simple tasks. "So often I dreamed of giving her a lingering hug, or asking her if she likes using flavored condoms, but I always chickened out," Winters said. "Whenever I'd thought I'd gathered the courage to take out that black-on-black porno movie and put it on my desk before calling her into my office, my palms would get all sweaty, and I'd lose my nerve." After having nearly resigned himself to another seven years of unspoken requests for sexual favors, Winters seized an opportunity to express his feelings Monday morning, offering to help Davis "get to the important stuff" as she bent over a file cabinet. Later, as further proof of his commitment, Winters suggested that he and Davis discuss a possible promotion at his beach house over the weekend. "I felt like I was walking on air — it was better than any graphic scenario I could have imagined and then quietly described to Anna in great detail during a budget meeting," Winters said. "And I can't believe I'm going to be able to call her 'Teeny Tits' in front of the whole office at last," he added. Many of Winters' coworkers took notice of his new attitude and gallant groping style, with several expressing their congratulations to the newly confident and emboldened Winters. "Scott had always told me he thought Anna was a hot piece of tail," said Nathan Reynolds, senior financial advisor and Winters' long-time squash partner. "But he never had the gall to make the first unwelcome advance or leave that photocopy of his penis on her desk. So when I overheard him asking Anna if the carpet matches the drapes, you can imagine how excited I was for him — this looks like the beginning of a beautiful hostile work environment." According to Reynolds, Winters had delayed acting on his desires because of a bad experience with a former assistant that had taken a toll on his self-esteem. Reynolds declined to provide further information, saying he couldn't betray his friend's confidence or discuss pending litigation. While it took Winters several years to make the first move — due in part to his past failures and his current marriage — and tell Davis that thongs were, in fact, encouraged on casual Fridays, he seemed to be making up for lost time: By lunch he had already e-mailed his secretary a doctored image of her and Salma Hayek, slipped a copy of the Kama Sutra under her door, and offered to give her a gynecological exam "free of charge." "It's silly to think that I used to get so tongue-tied around someone who makes less than a third of my total salary and whom I could have fired at any time," Winters said. "I only wish it hadn't taken so long to find the perfect gesture to show her how aroused I always was." "Just think — if I had simply taken a chance and rubbed against her in the elevator several years ago, we could have been in the middle of a wonderful affair by now," he added.

Voyeur Concerned About Lack Of Sex In Neighbors' Marriage
EDWARDSVILLE, KS — Local Peeping Tom David Sutcliffe expressed concern Monday that next-door neighbors John and Kimberly Hobsbaum's love life may be in jeopardy. "On the surface, John and Kim appear to be the perfect couple," said Sutcliffe, 39, who claimed to know the couple better than most. "They live in a tastefully decorated three-bedroom home, are the proud parents of a beautiful son, and possess all the trappings of modern convenience. But when you take a closer look at their life through the lenses of a powerful set of binoculars, their marriage isn't all it seems. Sutcliffe said he first suspected that something might be wrong with the Hobsbaums' relationship after seeing Kimberly quietly crying in the shower six months ago. "I almost didn't notice it at first," Sutcliffe said. "But when I zoomed out on my camcorder, there she was, weeping. According to Sutcliffe, the rare occasions when Kimberly and John engage in sexual intercourse lack the spontaneity of the early years of their relationship. "There was a time when they, and I, simply couldn't predict when an impulsive lovemaking session would break out," said Sutcliffe, who admitted that he hasn't needed to move his camouflaged camcorder from its tripod in months. "You don't have to examine hundreds of hours of recorded footage to figure out that sex has become a chore for the Hobsbaums," Sutcliffe said. "Although it does help. While Sutcliffe said it would be "unrealistic" to think the couple could rekindle the same passion found in their early days — particularly the "unforgettable" evening of Oct. 12, 1998 — he said they can still take steps to recharge their sex life. "Men are visually stimulated," Sutcliffe said as he dimmed the lights, unbuttoned his pants, and leaned forward to peer through a narrow opening in his window blinds. "Maybe Kimberly could greet John one evening in nothing but her red lace teddy. Or at the very least, she could insist that they have sex with the lights on, adding spontaneity and making my night-vision goggles unnecessary. Continued Sutcliffe: "If that doesn't work, perhaps the Hobsbaums could try introducing another person into their bedroom — perhaps that fit, redheaded friend of theirs who sometimes comes over for dinner. Sutcliffe had dozens of other suggestions, including slower, more sensual foreplay, inventive role-playing based on Victorian themes, experimenting with new sexual positions on their back patio, and, should all else fail, "videotaping their lovemaking sessions. Sutcliffe warned that couples often don't realize that small gestures like a kiss good-bye in the morning, clear of any sight-line obstructions such as tall floor lamps, can make all the difference in the world. "Honestly, I can't remember the last time I lip-read John telling Kimberly that he loved her," Sutcliffe said. "This couple needs to talk about their problems, not ignore them," he went on. "More than anything, they need honest, clear communication, preferably with a lot of sexually explicit verbalizations near an open window within range of my shotgun microphone. Although the Hobsbaums may have reached a low point in their sex life, Sutcliffe pointed out that this is not an uncommon occurrence among married couples he's observed. "I've sat in this chair or crouched in my garage and watched this happen many times before," said Sutcliffe, who asserted that an outsider's perspective is invaluable for recognizing problems in a marriage. "Many couples, like the Menekens directly across the street, or the Stephensons, whose bedroom faces my kitchen, forget that sustaining a loving relationship requires a lot of hard work. The good news, according to Sutcliffe, is that the Hobsbaums' decreased sex life doesn't seem to be the result of physical illness or inadequacy. "They're clearly still interested in sex," he said. "At least these photos, taken during the day when John was alone in the computer room, seem to indicate this. Yet Sutcliffe added that, unless the Hobsbaums start mending their relationship soon, he fears one of them might look for affection where Sutcliffe won't be able to closely monitor them. "I would hate to see something like that happen to such a photogenic couple," he said.

Kidnappers Realize They Have No Idea What Child Is Worth
SAN YSIDRO, CA — The weekend kidnapping of 5-year-old Brendan Adler stalled Tuesday when the two men responsible for his abduction announced that they have no way to gauge the current market value of the boy. "We've run through a lot of figures, but the truth is we have no idea," said Troy Alan Curtis, the crime's primary planner. "We've been talking about anything from $1,000,000 to $10,000. It's all over the map. The inability of Curtis and partner Steve Rodriguez to arrive at a realistic ransom figure has stymied the otherwise smooth kidnapping, which began Saturday morning when the pair snatched Adler from a local park and drove him to their abandoned-warehouse hideout. Yet four days later, the kidnappers say they are no closer to an accurate estimate of how much a boy in Adler's age and condition can fetch in the often confusing, constantly changing abductee marketplace. Curtis also worried that the lost time has cost the kidnappers critical leverage in demanding a ransom "worth the effort. "The price window is closing," Curtis said. "Steve thinks it could be good to keep the family waiting, but for all we know, they might think the kid is dead already. He added: "It's the not knowing that's hardest for us. "We probably should've given them a ballpark figure and just bargained from there," Curtis said. "Look at where we are now. Shortly after bringing Adler to their safehouse, the two realized that though they had elaborate plans for collecting the ransom — including a fake public mailbox and two decoy briefcases — they had not determined a specific price. In "a moment of panic," they briefly considered sending the family a "Reply-To" note, asking them how much they would be willing to pay. But the two ultimately decided that, no matter how carefully they phrased the question, the risk that the family would lowball them was too great. Both men admitted that they never discussed a value before the kidnapping, assuming that the price was "a foregone conclusion. "When it came to the amount of money we wanted, I guess we both thought, 'a lot,'" said Rodriguez, whose deep telephone voice made him the natural choice to be the liaison with the family. "Not knowing anything about him, I would say the kid is worth 50 or 60 grand. After casing his family's swanky home, though, that almost feels like it'd be a steal for them. I'd hate to find out later in the papers that they would've paid up to half a million. "On the other hand, we wind up looking like we didn't do our homework if we go high and it turns out the family doesn't have that kind of money," Rodriguez said. "It's a real balancing act. The two first-time kidnappers said they were "frustrated with the whole process," and would possibly have been able to come up with a more straightforward amount if they had abducted the Adler family's 3-year-old daughter, Amity. Said Rodriguez: "You wonder, is a girl worth more than a boy? Is younger better? But it's pointless to second-guess the decision we made. "If we had thought to scuff him up a bit and send pictures, I bet we would have been able to name our price," Curtis said. "But some say roughing them up lowers the value. See, I just don't know. At one point, according to the kidnappers, they removed the boy's gag and blindfold to ask him what he thought his parents would pay to get him back alive. "That was no help at all," Curtis said. "He cried for a long time, and it took a while just to get him to speak coherently. " After giving Adler some crackers and letting him watch TV, they posed the question again, and the boy estimated his own worth at "$100 million bazillion. Curtis blamed the lack of any reliable source to consult for their failure to make an informed estimate. "There's no kidnappers' price guide, the Internet is filled with bad information, and Blockbuster is missing their copy of the Mel Gibson movie Ransom," Curtis said. "We feel a little bit like we're on our own here. After spending more than $700 on gas, food, rope, folding chairs, and other supplies, the duo decided to factor those costs into a final figure and "work from there. "Things like juice boxes add up pretty quickly," Curtis said. "Then there's the possible long-term upkeep to consider, which is a scenario we do not want to get into. In short, we're stuck. Despite the complications, Curtis and Rodriguez are still hoping to come up with a workable number before too long and hope they do not have to resort to slaying the child. "At this point, we're just looking to recoup our losses and get compensated for our time and energy," Rodriguez said. "We've put a lot into this. Killing the kid would feel like throwing that all away.

Area Woman Fulfills Dream Of Becoming Writer By Getting Job At Bookstore
PHILADELPHIA — Aspiring novelist Sandy Bellman took the last step in her personal journey as a professional writer last week when she was hired at a west-side Barnes & Noble. "This has been a big year for me creatively, and getting this was the biggest step yet," said Bellman whose hiring, according to sources close to the 27-year-old, will almost certainly be her greatest literary achievement. "After all this time, I'm finally part of the world of books. " Bellman is expected to sell her first novel, most likely Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner or James Patterson's Judge And Jury, shortly after beginning her training shift next Monday.

Marriage Teeming With Sexual Tension
TRAVERSE CITY, MI — Although both believe that a romantic affair would only complicate their daily interaction with each other, Troy and Tania Knudsen find it more and more challenging not to act on a powerful mutual sexual attraction, sources close to the married couple said Monday. "You can really sense that something is going on between them," said neighbor Lisa Eisennagel, who has known the Knudsens for nine of the 12 years they've been married. "It's so palpable, it's sometimes uncomfortable to be around them. Friends who spend regular time with the pair have all noted the tentative glances, a tendency to linger around each other, and inappropriate touching. "Tania hints at how she's attracted to Troy," said Eisennagel, who claimed to have shared many talks with Tania about her hidden feelings for her husband. "I'm sure he feels the same way. It's so obvious at this point. But Tania is reluctant to act on feelings they both "might regret," according to Eisennagel. "Tania's always going, 'Is he thinking about me? Does he feel the same way?' I say, 'Why not ask him?' But she just turns red and changes the subject. According to the Knudsens, their close shared quarters make even the smallest interactions both exhilarating and stressful. Earlier this month, Troy, flustered after catching a glimpse of Tania's cleavage as she placed a plate of waffles on the kitchen table, had to excuse himself to smoke a cigarette on the back porch. The couple's thighs touched briefly while watching TV on the living-room sofa last Wednesday, though both fought the urge to make eye contact. Likewise, the narrow hallway between the living room and kitchen has played host to some awkward, charged moments. "I only have one more semester before I earn my physical-therapy degree, and this career change is important to me," Tania Knudsen said. "I also have two young kids to consider. I can't imagine risking all that, just because I can't resist these urges. She added: "Though sometimes it feels like I'm torturing myself. For Troy Knudsen's part, the plumbing contractor said he often anguishes over whether his wife shares the same impulses. "I have to share a bedroom with this woman for the rest of my life, so I don't want to do anything to make things awkward," Knudsen said. "I have a routine I'm used to, and taking it to the next level is not part of that routine. "He said he often lies next to her, struggling not to kiss her," said longtime friend Ken Boehmer, who introduced the two in 1992. "And one time, she bumped up against him in bed. I was like, 'That was the perfect opportunity, dude!' It just sounds like they're making excuses. We all wish they'd just fuck already and get it over with. If it doesn't work out, I think they could handle it in a mature fashion. After all, they're both 36 years old. While some of the couple's friends believed the intense sexual tension and the nature of their relationship made succumbing to their attraction for each other inevitable, others said that it has gone on too long for them to relent. All, however, agreed that if they came clean with their feelings, they would at least both be able to get on with their married lives. "If they're 'best friends,' as they put it, why did Tania wipe that barbecue sauce off Troy's cheek the way she did? " said neighbor Pete Lorenzo, who invited the pair to his annual Fourth Of July cookout. "And the way Troy wrestled with Tania for the last piece of bratwurst? Christ, get a room. Or just go home.

Woman In Coffee Shop Judges A Record 147 People
PORTLAND, OR — Clarissa Nantz, a clothing buyer for Nordstrom's and a coffee-shop regular, broke her own record for judgmental behavior when she judged 147 fellow customers, passersby, and motorists in an almost constant stream of criticism during the 25 minutes it took her to enjoy a soy-mocha frappachesso at Portland's Eagle's Roast Monday. "Oh, God, lady, who cuts your hair — you? And nice laugh, by the way. That must really get them rolling back at the barnyard," said Nantz, whose previous under-her-breath-judgments record was 134. A young man dressed in a secondhand bowling shirt, a woman who poured several Splendas into her fat-free latte, and an elderly man with a broken leg were similarly unspared. Nantz is poised to break her record Sunday at her husband's family reunion.

Drunk Will Show You, Everybody
YOUNGSTOWN, OH — In response to the shit he knows everyone is saying about him, local resident Todd Stenerud, after a prolonged drinking session, announced his intention to show you and everyone else just minutes before closing time at a local bar Monday. "You people don't know [what] the fuck you're talking about," Stenerud announced from his stool at Dan's Pub. "You think I can't? Know what? I'll show you. I'll show everybody. Stenerud, who is frequently drunk, added that if those assembled were opposed to his announcement, they could kiss his "big red baboon ass. Although Stenerud did not specify what he intended to show, he addressed a number of issues in detail, including the lack of credit he is given "day in and day goddamn out," his endless payment of dues "day after day after day," and a general sentiment of not giving a fuck today or any other fucking day. "Look, there's me," Stenerud said, pointing out his reflection cast in the bar-length mirror. "That's the guy that's going to kick all of your asses. Bartender Hope Krzysch said that Stenerud, a regular patron, was served eight bottles of Miller Genuine Draft and six shots of Jim Beam in the four hours prior to making his remarks. In a statement typified by earnest, strongly worded proclamations, one of Stenerud's most impassioned comments was that the occasion marked the very first time that he had ever spoken the truth to anyone. "It's all clear to me now. I can see right through you sons of bitches. Too bad you're not me right now. That's just too fucking bad for you. The announcement was cut short when Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here" played over the bar's jukebox, prompting Stenerud to remark, "I love this tune," close his eyes, and silently mouth the lyrics for the duration of the song. Patrons at the bar reflected on Stenerud's charges of shit-talking. "I don't know the guy," Web designer Steve Dreyfuss said. "But I hope he eventually shows everybody. I wish him well. Stenerud, known in the area for inebriated, forceful announcements, has in the past shown everyone his ability to lift a table over his head, remove a hard-boiled egg from a glass without touching the glass, and construct a tiny man from a paper match. Still, observers said it was unlikely that these actions were what Stenerud was determined to show Monday. Though he focused on showing everyone, Stenerud also demanded to know what the fuck everyone was laughing at. "You think that's funny? " he asked on one of the few occasions he rose to his feet. "I'll show you what's funny. Come on. After a series of alternatingly aggressive and inquisitive gestures, Stenerud nearly toppled to the ground, narrowly avoiding striking his head on a footrest. Semiregular Dan's Pub patron and die-cutter Ed Sieves tried to assure Stenerud that nobody was laughing, and, after a brief staredown, the walleyed Stenerud embraced Sieves in an emotional bear hug. "This guy's like a brother. He's a good fuckin' man," Stenerud said, attempting to lift Sieves off the ground. "You're the best friend a guy could have. No. No. No. No. I mean it. There's nobody I'd rather want to spend time with than all you fuckers. You guys. You guys. I fuckin'." Stenerud then asked, "Did you see me pick him up? After two minutes of a silence described by witnesses as "sullen," Stenerud announced that he had one last fucking thing to tell the audience. "You'd think? Fuckin'. I want to go call my ex-wife," Stenerud said, apparently concluding the speech. Stenerud is expected to return to Dan's Pub on Friday, but it is unknown whether he will show anyone anything else at that time.

Plan To Straighten Out Entire Life During Weeklong Vacation Yields Mixed Results
MANCHESTER, NH — Returning to work after seven days off, Derek Olson, 31, confessed Monday that his plan to use his weeklong vacation to straighten out his life yielded mixed results. "This was the week all the shit I'd been putting off for years — big and small — was going to get done," said Olson, a data-entry operator at A.G. Edwards & Sons. "From getting Steve and Kim a gift for their wedding two months ago to going through all those boxes I'd left unpacked since moving here in 2004 to finally deciding what my future is with [girlfriend] Melanie [Stirre], it was all going to get taken care of. "I did pay my gas bill," Olson continued, "but then I lost the envelope somewhere on the way to the mailbox, so now I have to wait for a second notice. After using last Saturday and Sunday — the first two days of his break — to recover from "a shitstorm of a work week," Olson decided he would begin straightening up his life first thing Monday morning. "I thought that if I didn't rest up over the weekend, I'd burn out halfway through my week off," said Olson, explaining the slow start. "Saturday night, I did write up a list of what I wanted to accomplish over the course of the coming week, but it wasn't really all that complete. Among the goals written on the abbreviated list: a thorough cleaning of his apartment, laundry, re-ordering of checks, buying a bigger CD shelf, signing up for a T'ai Chi course, cashing in a large jar of loose change at the bank, updating his resume, looking for a new job, and "figuring out the whole Melanie thing. Olson's plan to straighten out his life first thing Monday morning was derailed the evening prior. "I was going to go to bed early Sunday so I could get up early Monday and start on all my projects," Olson said. "But then I realized I could go to Rocky's [Bar & Grill], where they have this really cool thing called Rocky's Sunday Night Record Jam, where this guy spins all these really cool old vinyl records, everything from Curtis Mayfield to The Damned. I normally never get to go because I have to get up at 6 a.m. Mondays, so I figured it was my big chance. But then I got a little more drunk than I'd planned. Upon waking up Monday, a hung-over Olson decided it would be a "day of recovery" and vowed to begin first thing Tuesday. After spending most of Tuesday in his bathrobe re-reading Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, Olson finally went to the basement that evening to begin the first of his many projects. "I decided the first thing I was going to do was unpack all the stuff in the basement," Olson said. "When I opened the first box marked 'Magazines,' it had nothing but a bunch of socks and my electric pencil sharpener. I got so pissed off with my lack of organization, I went back upstairs and started watching TV." Having accomplished only a few tasks Wednesday and Thursday, Olson knew he would have to "really bear down" Friday. "I actually would've gotten a lot of stuff done Friday if the whole universe hadn't been against me," Olson said. "I took my car in to get my tires rotated, but the guy said he couldn't get to it until the following Tuesday, so I was like, 'Screw that.' I also went to Staples to pick up the computer desk I'd had on layaway for the last month, but I forgot to bring my receipt. They wouldn't give the stupid thing to me, even after arguing with the guy for almost an hour. The whole day was a colossal waste. Except I got a new belt I needed for work. After devoting Friday night to drinking to unwind from the computer-desk episode, a once again hung-over Olson spent most of Saturday re-alphabetizing his CDs, a task he did not plan to take on during his week off but needed to be done. Sunday was spent fretting over the wasted week and berating himself for not going to San Diego — a trip he'd strongly considered taking before committing to staying home and getting his life in order. "Next year, I'm definitely going to San Diego," Olson said. "This was stupid. According to corporate consultant and motivational speaker Jeffrey Hatcher, trying to catch up on years of neglected goals in one week is not a good strategy. "You have to make a conscious effort every day," Hatcher said. "You can't spend years letting things fall apart and then fix it all in seven days. It's just not possible. Perhaps if Derek had had two weeks off, he might have been able to catch up on a sizable portion of his tasks, but he won't be getting two weeks of vacation at his job for at least another three years, before which time he'll most certainly be fired for being so disorganized. So there's no real point in talking about it.

Father Doesn't Understand Teenage Son's Obsession With Classic Rock
SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA — Phil Poole, 42, said Monday that he is coming to grips with his 15-year-old son Carter's taste in music. "I thought he was playing it as a sarcastic thing, and I was like, 'Hey, kid, your mother and I dated to Boston and Journey,'" Poole said. "But after I overheard him talking about it with his friends, I realized he actually likes it. Then I got worried — I mean, his mother and I dated to Boston and Journey." Poole added that he will not give Carter $30 to buy a Hot Topic rip-off of the Asia T-shirt he bought for $10 at Spencer's Gifts in 1982.

Christian Juggler Regrets Years Wasted As Secular Juggler
TUPELO, MS — Born-again Christian juggler Jesse Lindall, 44, said Tuesday he regrets his secular past. "Kids are trying to juggle friends and school, so it can be overwhelming when Satan throws them a temptation — ho! " Lindall said as he added a flaming torch to a circle of juggling pins. "I used to juggle for kicks and some spare change, but now I'm doing it to spread Christ's Word to young people. I only wish I would've used my juggling for a greater purpose years ago. Ho!" Lindall said he is working on a new bit that involves juggling multiplying loaves of bread and fish.

Slipped Disc Celebrates 10th Year As Excuse For Everything
CHARLOTTE, NC — Friends of 33-year-old Matt Breunich quietly observed the 10th anniversary of his lower-back problem, a chronic condition that has served as an ongoing reason to excuse himself from such diverse activities as taking out the trash, helping friends move, and making love to his girlfriend. "No matter what's going on, you can always count on Matt's slipped disc to act up," said longtime friend Janet Wolck, who joined 13 others in an evening of reminiscence at a local restaurant Tuesday. "It's been one heck of an excuse-laden decade. According to gathering organizer Tony Kairns, it was in April 1996 that Breunich first revealed the existence of a herniated disc in his lower back when declining at the last minute to help a group of friends move into their first off-campus home. "While we've never verified the exact date of the alleged injury, everyone agrees that that was the first time they heard the excuse," said Kairns, who has known Breunich since they were college freshman roommates 12 years ago. "Everyone was so concerned because it sounded serious. None of us suspected the excuse would last this long. In that time, Breunich has used the slipped-disc excuse a number of times estimated by friends to be between one and three zillion. It has served as Breunich's ticket out of stripping paint, attending a coworker's going-away party, changing a tire, holding a friend's baby, setting up a tent, conveying pitchers of beer from the bar to an awaiting table, making a bed, vacuuming, retrieving an escaped guinea pig, shoveling snow, kissing the Blarney Stone, cleaning out a garage, and going on approximately 14 second dates. Even as friends' concern over the injury gradually grew into bemusement, then indifference, the excuse persisted. Ex-girlfriend Lauren Vargas marveled at its longevity, saying that as recently as February, Breunich "trotted out the old chestnut" when asked to deliver canned goods to a local homeless shelter. "It's fun to feed him terms like 'torn lumbar region' and 'bone chips' and so on," Vargas said, "then watch him find a way to incorporate them into the excuse next time around. "Does your back need to be in peak condition in order to watch a pro basketball game? " said Charlotte Bobcats fan Kyle LaGrange, echoing the evening's trend of rhetorical questioning. Though no one has been able to determine whether Breunich ever truly slipped a disc, Kairns said he felt especially privileged to "be on the scene" when the excuse transformed from a casual complaint about his lower back to a full-blown prolapsed vertebra. Breunich told Kairns that a first-year medical student he had met at a bar said that his back pain might be due to a slipped disc. "I don't think he's ever seen a doctor or a chiropractor about it," Kairns said. "You'd think that he would, with all that pain and apparent immobility. Despite his unwillingness to consult the medical establishment, Breunich remains attentive to his condition, often requiring the most comfortable chair in a given room "for his back," according to Kairns. Though admitting they had no specific knowledge, Breunich's friends were fairly certain that modern medicine had devised treatments for the condition, with a few guessing that proper care and bedrest could allow slipped discs to mend on their own. Some were also baffled by the injury's versatility, specifically its ability to travel from the lower back to the neck region. Jeff Lewis, who works with Breunich at a Charlotte-area data-recovery firm, noted that back complaints disappear during activities Breunich enjoys, including company softball games, where he is the team's leading hitter and hasn't missed a game in four years. "That can't be good for his back," Lewis said. "But I guess he fights through the pain, like he must when he's hunched over playing Quake 4 for hours on end. When coworker Dave Amato added that Breunich had recently complained of possible carpal tunnel syndrome, excusing him from three major projects, it inspired lively speculation from the group about a new era of potential injuries. "This has the potential to be a real 'stealth excuse' for Matt," Lewis said. "There are times when a headache or a backache just isn't appropriate, and I'm sure those will be exactly the times when his carpal tunnel will flare up. Breunich was invited to the gathering, but canceled due to an unspecified medical ailment.

Mover Regales Area Man With Story Of Time He Moved Dresser Just Like This One
PONTIAC, MI — During a routine crosstown job Monday, Triple S Transfer And Storage mover Ron Estes informed client Ward Buell that Buell's bedroom dresser was remarkably similar to one that Estes encountered "about five years ago. "I've seen one of these before," Estes said. "This one is stained a little lighter and has different drawer pulls, but otherwise it's the same make. Getting on his knees to look underneath the dresser, Estes added: "Yeah, you can tell by these slats down here. Instead of wordlessly moving the dresser out to the truck with a coworker, the barrel-chested, T-shirted Estes leaned against a windowsill and placed a hand on an upturned mattress to tell Buell about the dresser similar to his own. "I remember the day," Estes said. "We took all the drawers out, of course. Then I lifted it the way I normally would: with one hand on the upper back and the other on the front base edging. But then you couldn't angle it, because they had pretty narrow doorways in that place. Said Estes: "You had to hold it straight. According to Buell, Estes examined the back of the dresser before resuming his tale to the man who was paying $25 an hour for his services. "The lady who owned that dresser had another unit with these sort of curvy, puffed-out drawers," Estes said. "She called it a bomb. I thought she was joking, but they really are called bombs. Pretty crazy. "It was in her living room," Estes added. "We brought it out through the kitchen. Estes then requested some water from Buell. "Everything else in that house was short work — even their sofa was less heavy than we expected," Estes said. "But I really nicked my middle finger getting that sucker through the doorway. We unscrewed the legs from the bottom, which is pretty common with sofas like that one, but it still wasn't fitting. I thought for a while there we were going to have to remove the door frame. That would've been tough. Estes continued: "But I said, 'Let's give her one more try,' and we got her through. Estes then apologized for the digression and announced that he would bring his remarks "back to the story of the dresser. "It wasn't hard to get a solid grip on that thing. You had short legs, and solid central struts between where the drawers go that you can grab onto. Basically, whatever part you wanted to grab on that was convenient, really," Estes said. He continued: "Mike [Steinke] and I, that's the guy I was with, we brought that particular piece outside the house and I had adjusted my hold and was carrying it with one hand on the central strut and I heard this little 'whr-whr-whr.' One of those pieces, it'd started to turn a little bit. "No permanent damage," Estes said quickly. "No damage was done to the piece. But it turns out those planks were only held in by one nail on each side, which a lot of these types of dressers are. And it could just spin around if you got the wrong hold on it. I didn't know this at that time. We were both pretty new on the job. I've handled a lot of furniture since then, and you start to get a feel. "Mike was killed in Iraq a couple years back," Estes added. Apparently sensing Buell's growing unease, Estes turned the conversation around, asking Buell a series of questions about the dresser. Buell said he didn't remember where he bought it, but it might have been at an antique-furniture store across town. He also denied staining the dresser himself. Reached for comment Tuesday, Estes characterized the similarity of the two dressers as "a funny coincidence. "You see a fair number of these types of dressers, and when you're a mover and see stuff like that, the alarm bells go off," Estes said. "I believe K & L Furniture was selling these up until a couple years ago, at least. They probably still are. Representatives from K & L Furniture-4-Less could not be reached for comment.

Pedophile Less Interested The More He Views 13-Year-Old's MySpace Profile
LONGVIEW, TX — Area pedophile Dwight Sanderson said Monday that his interest in getting to know and eventually meeting MySpace.com member "Courtneee" has significantly declined after a closer read of the "lame" hobbies and "self-involved" blog entries on the 13-year-old's profile. According to Sanderson, 47, Courtneee's picture caught his eye while he was searching the Judson Middle School MySpace community and found her "Gemini_diva" page. "At first, she seemed like my type of girl — innocent-looking, single, and, best of all, she lives right nearby," he said. Sanderson continued: "Her profile seemed very enticing at first. She plays softball in the same park that I always hang around in. But right before I was going to leave her a private message, I decided to check out her latest blog post. He said the 1,500-word entry "droned on and on" about everything from dealing with her great-grandmother's death last year to hopes for her new job as class treasurer. "I'm looking for a cell-phone number and a home address, not your life story," he said. Though admittedly discouraged, Sanderson, who classifies himself as "not very picky," said he still hoped that Courtneee could play a small, fleeting part in his future. "I'm an optimist, even though I've been burned by girls like Courtneee in the past. You think you know everything about them — their dark secrets, their heroes, their class schedule — but they end up betraying your confidence and talking about your relationship behind your back to any authority figure who'll listen," Sanderson said. Sanderson pointed out several other "red flags" in Courtneee's profile, including "pathetic, almost obsessive" blog entries about her ex-crush, the fact that her "Interests and Personality" section mentions that she might want to have children someday, and her terrible taste in movies. "I'm used to getting involved with younger, less mature women, but she's got the sense of humor of an 8-year-old," Sanderson said. "I can't bring myself to pretend to like 50 First Dates, even to establish a base of shared interests, build rapport, and eventually earn her complete trust. "Also, one of her friends left a recent comment accusing her of being a 'big-mouth who likes to spread rumors,'" Sanderson added. "I can't tell you how big a turnoff that is for me. According to Sanderson, the most discouraging revelation came when he viewed Courtneee's "More Pics" section, in which she reportedly looks "way older" than she does in her featured front-page photo. "When I saw the other pictures, I was like, 'How old is this girl, 15?'" Sanderson said. "In these pictures, she had braces, acne, noticeable breasts — nothing like the baby-faced little girl she appeared to be on her main page. She probably hasn't updated that picture in a year and a half. Though he made a legally binding promise to himself and law-enforcement officials that he would never pursue another relationship like this, Sanderson says he nonetheless plans to "give it a shot. "Internet dating can be risky," he said, "but at my age, and their age, it's really the only way.

TV-News Graphics Guy Gives Weatherman On-Air Surprise
OKLAHOMA CITY, OK — On the surface, the newsroom of local NBC affiliate KFOR appears to be quite serious. But that doesn't mean the Live At Five news team doesn't know how to have some fun from time to time, as viewers learned Monday night. According to computer-graphic designer Dan Janney, the news broadcast team nearly lost its composure Monday, when his irreverent weather-map graphic went live during a segment by Channel 4 meteorologist Grant Johnson. "It's more my style to stay behind the scenes," Janney said. "But every once in a while, I have to admit, it's fun to push the envelope. Janney added: "I like to give the crew a good laugh. In the graphic, which he designed for the five-day extended forecast chart that concludes the weather segment, Janney replaced the network's "sun in sunshades" graphic with the head of veteran KFOR sports anchor Bob Barry Sr. wearing sunshades and surrounded by a halo of golden rays. "I had the idea, and I told my assistant Jennifer Sabin about it, and she thought it was hysterical, so we spent about 10 minutes putting it together on our lunch break," Janney said. "To our good fortune, the weekend portion of the chart forecasted sunny weather, so the gag got high visibility. Janney added: "It had the guys in the control room in stitches before air time. I begged [newscast director] Jim [Underwood] not to tell Grant about it, and thankfully he agreed. He knows how to play a joke. Underwood, who has directed local KFOR programming for 18 years and produces the Sunday morning current-events roundtable Think About It With Neil Clover, enthusiastically agreed to televise Janney's graphic, calling it "an amusing change of pace. " He even authorized camera operator Mike Bethke to capture the reaction of lead anchor Chuck Bartlett in a highly unusual cutaway from the forecast graphic. "The usual 'sun wearing the shades' graphic is cute — we still get letters about it from viewers," Underwood said. "But replacing that sun with Bob Barry? That was a hoot. Underwood added: "Live At Five has a reputation for having an offbeat sense of humor, and that's a part of its appeal. According to Janney, Johnston does not normally look at the monitor while introducing the extended forecast and was initially confused by the titters coming from the camera operators. When he saw the monitor, he broke into a wide grin, chuckled, and said, "And there's Bob Barry, KFOR's original golden boy. "It was a wonderful ad-lib," Sabin said. "I'll bet most of the home audience thought he was in on the joke from the start. But he wasn't. He's that good. Said Janney: "The killer part was when Grant threw to Chuck, and Chuck sang a couple of bars of 'You Are The Sunshine Of My Life.' Practically everyone in the studio was dying. But Grant didn't miss a beat. He comes right back with, 'Aw, Chuck, I didn't know you cared.' By that point, everybody on set was in stitches. Janney has received positive feedback for his shenanigan, including e-mails of praise from viewers. Yet, when asked about doing something similar in the future, Janney became coy. "If we did something silly every day, we'd risk losing our edge," he said. "But who knows when something like that will happen again. You'll just have to keep watching Live At Five to find out.

Girlfriend Dumped After Valentine-Candy-Related Weight Gain
MONTCLAIR, NJ — 27-year-old LeeAnne Copeland's decision to consume an entire box of Valentine's chocolates over the course of five days led her boyfriend of 10 months to end their relationship Monday. Michael Kristoff, 27, a part-time bartender, gave Copeland a two-pound, red-satin-lined box of Russell Stover premium assorted chocolates on Valentine's Day. According to Kristoff, Copeland "really packed on the pounds" in the days that followed. "It was noticeable," Kristoff said, describing a bulge on Copeland's midriff. "She seemed completely unaware of what she was doing to herself physically, and I found that very disconcerting." The weight gain, which Kristoff estimated to be between three and five pounds, transformed the young woman into "kind of a porker," according to Kristoff. "Before the candy, LeeAnne was an active person," Kristoff said. "She was always hopping around, straightening up her apartment, going to the gym." However, the chocolate, coupled with a snowstorm that shut down much of the Northeast, "gave [Copeland] an all-too-convenient excuse" to spend a week watching DVDs and eating chocolate. "For the next couple nights, when I'd come over I'd notice her stealing into the candy box, cramming her face," Kristoff said. "She even made a joke about it, telling me that she could see why they put Valentine's Day in February, when it was cold and snowy and there wasn't much else to do but eat. Like it was all a big joke to her." Kristoff said he was repulsed by the sight of Copeland eating. "I'd seen her eat before, but it was nothing like this," Kristoff said. "You could see chocolate dotting her teeth and tiny strings of saliva between her lips and traces of nougat and coconut on the corners of her mouth." Kristoff added: "It made me sick." Copeland initially refused to eat the chocolate, according to Kristoff. "She was all, 'Oh, no, no, I can't eat all these, they're way too fattening,'" said Kristoff, impersonating Copeland. "She was trying to get me to eat most of the box, and was really stubborn about it." "It's kind of ironic, considering how this has all panned out," Kristoff added. Kristoff said that as he watched Copeland take her first, tentative bite of a strawberry cream, he had "this out-of-nowhere premonition." "It struck me that the chocolate-eating could be a foreshadowing of things to come," Kristoff said. "If I took her out to a steak place for her birthday, would she finish her whole meal? And what about holidays like Thanksgiving? When I got to thinking about the wedding cake, that's when the alarm bells really went off." Despite these strong reservations, Kristoff said he "remained in deep denial for several days." "I tried to make it work," Kristoff said. "I tried to tell myself that maybe the old LeeAnne would come back once the chocolates were gone, but I didn't think I could wait it out." Kristoff severed ties via a brief e-mail. Copeland said the sudden breakup had left her devastated, confused, and "so depressed I can't eat." Reached for comment, Kristoff said: "It's too bad she didn't display a little bit of that self-discipline earlier… We might still be together today."

Plan To Straighten Out Entire Life During Weeklong Vacation Yields Mixed Results
MANCHESTER, NH — Returning to work after seven days off, Derek Olson, 31, confessed Monday that his plan to use his weeklong vacation to straighten out his life yielded mixed results. "This was the week all the shit I'd been putting off for years — big and small — was going to get done," said Olson, a data-entry operator at A.G. Edwards & Sons. "From getting Steve and Kim a gift for their wedding two months ago to going through all those boxes I'd left unpacked since moving here in 2004 to finally deciding what my future is with [girlfriend] Melanie [Stirre], it was all going to get taken care of. "I did pay my gas bill," Olson continued, "but then I lost the envelope somewhere on the way to the mailbox, so now I have to wait for a second notice. After using last Saturday and Sunday — the first two days of his break — to recover from "a shitstorm of a work week," Olson decided he would begin straightening up his life first thing Monday morning. "I thought that if I didn't rest up over the weekend, I'd burn out halfway through my week off," said Olson, explaining the slow start. "Saturday night, I did write up a list of what I wanted to accomplish over the course of the coming week, but it wasn't really all that complete. Among the goals written on the abbreviated list: a thorough cleaning of his apartment, laundry, re-ordering of checks, buying a bigger CD shelf, signing up for a T'ai Chi course, cashing in a large jar of loose change at the bank, updating his resume, looking for a new job, and "figuring out the whole Melanie thing. Olson's plan to straighten out his life first thing Monday morning was derailed the evening prior. "I was going to go to bed early Sunday so I could get up early Monday and start on all my projects," Olson said. "But then I realized I could go to Rocky's [Bar & Grill], where they have this really cool thing called Rocky's Sunday Night Record Jam, where this guy spins all these really cool old vinyl records, everything from Curtis Mayfield to The Damned. I normally never get to go because I have to get up at 6 a.m. Mondays, so I figured it was my big chance. But then I got a little more drunk than I'd planned. Upon waking up Monday, a hung-over Olson decided it would be a "day of recovery" and vowed to begin first thing Tuesday. After spending most of Tuesday in his bathrobe re-reading Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, Olson finally went to the basement that evening to begin the first of his many projects. "I decided the first thing I was going to do was unpack all the stuff in the basement," Olson said. "When I opened the first box marked 'Magazines,' it had nothing but a bunch of socks and my electric pencil sharpener. I got so pissed off with my lack of organization, I went back upstairs and started watching TV." Having accomplished only a few tasks Wednesday and Thursday, Olson knew he would have to "really bear down" Friday. "I actually would've gotten a lot of stuff done Friday if the whole universe hadn't been against me," Olson said. "I took my car in to get my tires rotated, but the guy said he couldn't get to it until the following Tuesday, so I was like, 'Screw that.' I also went to Staples to pick up the computer desk I'd had on layaway for the last month, but I forgot to bring my receipt. They wouldn't give the stupid thing to me, even after arguing with the guy for almost an hour. The whole day was a colossal waste. Except I got a new belt I needed for work. After devoting Friday night to drinking to unwind from the computer-desk episode, a once again hung-over Olson spent most of Saturday re-alphabetizing his CDs, a task he did not plan to take on during his week off but needed to be done. Sunday was spent fretting over the wasted week and berating himself for not going to San Diego — a trip he'd strongly considered taking before committing to staying home and getting his life in order. "Next year, I'm definitely going to San Diego," Olson said. "This was stupid. According to corporate consultant and motivational speaker Jeffrey Hatcher, trying to catch up on years of neglected goals in one week is not a good strategy. "You have to make a conscious effort every day," Hatcher said. "You can't spend years letting things fall apart and then fix it all in seven days. It's just not possible. Perhaps if Derek had had two weeks off, he might have been able to catch up on a sizable portion of his tasks, but he won't be getting two weeks of vacation at his job for at least another three years, before which time he'll most certainly be fired for being so disorganized. So there's no real point in talking about it.

Man Just Using Virgin Mary To Get To Jesus
TUPELO, MS — The Blessed Mother Mary said Monday that devout Catholic Anthony Montero is simply praying to her as a way to get to her Son, Jesus Christ. "People exploit me for my connections, worshipping me as a way to get closer to Jesus," said the Holy Virgin, bathed in a golden light and attended by seraphim. "How would Anthony feel if I called upon him in the guise of friendship, but simply wanted his cousin to do some plumbing work for me? It's just rude. " Our Lady added that, if Montero wants to reach Jesus so badly, maybe he should "grow a pair and pray to Him directly.

Media Ignores Cancer Struggle Of Champion Unicyclist
KEY WEST, FL (July 26) — While seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong's battle with cancer has been well-covered in the media, his counterpart in the more insular world of unicycling has garnered very little attention. "Three-time Tour de Farce champion Nick Ienatsch's battle with mouth cancer is no less real than Armstrong's, and he should be considered just as powerful a symbol of triumph," said Mitch Boehm, editor-in-chief of Unicyclist magazine and Ienatsch's biographer. "He may be a wobblier, somewhat less-dignified symbol, but inarguably, one of hope. " Ienatsch, known for his brash, outspoken manner and his smokeless-tobacco sponsorship, claims he is not a hero. "I'm just fighting cancer as any other human-powered-vehicle enthusiast would," he said. "Be he bicyclist, unicyclist, recumbent bicyclist, or pogoist.

My Daughter, Who Lives At 152 East Medgar St. Apt. 4, Can't Keep Her Damn Legs Crossed
Being a father is no easy job, and it just gets tougher when you're a father to girls. Don't get me wrong: I love all my kids equally. But somehow, you worry more about your daughters, even — or especially — when they're not so little anymore. Like my daughter Sandra: a warm, intelligent, life-loving young woman who just got her first apartment at 152 East Medgar St. Apt. 4, and who can't seem to keep her damn legs crossed. Don't bother telling me that all young people go through a "wild" phase, or that I was the same way when I was a young man. That's part of it — I was a young man. I'm sorry, but it's just different. Though I must mention that I didn't swoon and fall on my back whenever someone put on Al Green's "Sha La La" or presented me with mocha-chocolate Godiva truffles. Sandra, though, that's my daughter all over. It seems like every day after work when she goes to Canoodler's on Park and 31st, she'll go home with the first reasonably polite guy who gives her the "big lonely city" line and buys her a Malibu Mojito. And the weekends are worse. I'm pretty sure her weakness for soft-spoken men with puppies has led to more than one Sunday-afternoon tryst with some cardigan-wearing Labrador-owner type from the Union Park dog run. I know it's possible that I'm overreacting. I know that Sandra is in no way a bad person, and she's far from a stupid person — although sometimes I expect the bespectacled types she goes all mushy over haven't actually read the Dostoevsky they're carrying around when she invites them back to her place. Every generation thinks they invented sex, but if you ask me, Sandra, with her RandySandy75 profile on Nerve, is just carrying out an age-old practice in a contemporary fashion. I just wish she wouldn't go on so many dates with scruffy men between 28 and 35 who come into Maxwell's Fine Wines and make her laugh with a clever remark about her name tag or her job as French vintages buyer. I know that, for Sandra, it's all part of being a young woman who can't resist candlelight, Thai food, and Bay Rhum aftershave. Believe me, she gets a lot of that from her mother, a wonderful and attractive woman with whom I'm still very close, and none of that is why we divorced and she moved to Unit 17 of the Park Tower Condominiums. But still, I wish Sandra would settle down with the quiet, studious type she claims to like. Instead, it's often just someone who likes to watch the same TV shows as her while using the treadmill next to her on the second floor of the Fitness Factory on Cooper Plaza Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Two Hipsters Angrily Call Each Other 'Hipster'
AUSTIN, TX — An argument between local hipsters Dan Walters and Brian Guterman has devolved to the point where each is angrily calling the other "hipster," those close to the pair reported Monday. "Hey, hipster! Here's 12 bucks — why don't you go get yourself a bucket of PBRs at the Gold Mine?" Walters, 22, is said to have told Guterman, 22, invoking the name of a local bar known for its "poseur" clientele. "Whatever you say, scenester," Guterman allegedly replied. "Don't you have a Death Cab For Cutie show to be at right now? " Acquaintances of Guterman and Walters trace the long-running conflict back to high school, when they reportedly threw pencils at each other and argued about who was more "emo."

Raccoons Force Garage Band Into Attic
GREENVILLE, NC — Members of the local grindcore music group Grimnir confirmed Monday that raccoons have forced the band to flee the garage of drummer Brian Bigelow's family home and relocate to the "crappy" attic. "At first, it was just one of them, digging around near the garbage cans," said Bigelow, 16, hunched over in the attic to avoid a low-hanging beam. "Then there was another one. Next thing you knew, they were just everywhere. Observers say three to four raccoons currently occupy the garage, owned by Albert and Janice Bigelow and converted into a practice space by Bigelow, guitarist Pete Stanislavsky, and bassist Marco Batista in September 2005. "They kept scratching at the garbage cans and ruined a bunch of recordings," Stanislavsky said. "And they chewed through Brian's bass drum and built a nest in there. That cost us 80 bucks to replace. Band members also cited 20 lost demo tapes and a chewed-up 12-pack of candy bars. They estimate the total loss caused by the raccoons to be more than $105. Sources close to the band suspect that the ready availability of food, as well as shelter from the cold weather, attracted the nocturnal creatures, who allegedly infiltrated the garage by digging holes beneath the structure's base. The raccoons reportedly began foraging near the site in December of last year, and while at first easily frightened away by the noise of Grimnir's Friday-evening practices, they were welcomed by the band. "We thought, 'Cool, there's, like, wild animals in here while we're playing,'" Bigelow said. Over the next few months, however, the animals grew accustomed to the noise, and became markedly more aggressive and territorial. It is also believed that they acquired a taste for Cheetos during this period. "Next thing you know, there's a whole fucking family of them, with their little eyes glowing back at us from the rafters," Batista said. Band members say their attempts to drive the raccoons away — setting out mothballs and bleach, and throwing drumsticks at them — proved ineffective. Finally, after Stanislavsky encountered a hissing, teeth-baring male, dubbed a "boar," the band was ultimately forced to abandon the space. "He tried to bite me,'" said Stanislavsky, who estimated the raccoon's weight to be "at least 50 pounds. The band retreated to the Bigelows' cramped and dusty attic only after a compromise with Bigelow's father in which they promised to clean the space and play their music at much lower levels. "Even after moving all that shit out," Bigelow said, "we can still barely fit. Saddled with an 8 p.m. curfew, a strict no-smoking policy, and "sucky" acoustics, Bigelow and his bandmates said the ongoing raccoon problem has seriously undermined Grimnir's creative output. Yet longtime fans disagree, insisting that the conflict has fueled some of the band's strongest work yet. "They've done some cool shit lately," said friend and classmate Dylan Holdness. "'Cord Chewer' fucking thrashes, man. 'Maskt' and 'Bastard Claaw of Mayhem' are pretty rockin', too. If they keep this up, they'll totally rule the Greenville grindcore scene.

"It might be a classic, but it sure is hard to keep your attention on it," McKinney said. "What happens to those Dust Bowl farmers during the Depression is sad, but I can only read so many descriptions of the dust and the crickets and the hard wrinkles in so-and-so's face. A true classic should be impossible to put down.

REEDSBURG, WI — Working-class father of four and veteran alcoholic James Schultz, 53, expressed deep disappointment Monday in his 19-year-old son Travis, for "turning into a goddamn pothead" after moving away from home to attend the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "After the hard work I put in at the screen-door factory all these years, this is how he rewards me? " Schultz said during a 1:30 a.m. statement held at Captain Pete's Bar and Grill. "That boy should be working for a living, like his old man, instead of smoking weed and doing God knows what with a bunch of liberal lowlifes. Schultz punctuated the impromptu speech by finishing off the last of his drink and ordering another from bartender and friend Al Zandek. Members of the family said Schultz and his son fought over Travis' illegal-drug use Sunday, after Schultz found a small bag of marijuana while rifling through the boy's pockets for beer money. The elder Schultz confronted his son at the dinner table that night. "He slurred his way through a half-coherent lecture on the dangers of addiction, shouting in my face about what a disappointment I was to the family," Travis said. Travis said Schultz continued his drunken anti-drug tirade well into the night, eventually lumbering out the door, presumably to go to Captain Pete's. When asked to comment on the face-off, Schultz's wife Ellen said that, while it is true that her son has been bringing a lot of funny ideas home, she didn't think college was "turning him into a druggie. "So he tried pot — a lot of young kids these days do things they later regret," said Ellen, 51. "Everybody has regrets about decisions they made when they were young. Ellen defended her husband, as well. "James only gets like that because he loves Travis," she said. "He's a very sensitive man. A lot of people don't realize that. They only see the temper. It's certainly nothing to call social services about, like [neighbor] Dianne Klosterbaum did last year. It's just the way James is when he's letting off steam. Safely amongst his drinking buddies at the bar, Schultz continued outlining his disappointment in Travis. "I wish he'd just sit down over some beers with me and talk this through," Schultz said. "But there's no talking sense to a dope addict. According to drinking companion Doug Blaine, Schultz keeps his feelings to himself, except when he's "half in the bag. "He'd never let on, but he's got a lot of pressures on him, what with his second mortgage, his liver troubles, and his court date coming up," Blaine said. "He's real closed off, but sometimes, late at night around last call, he'll start to let you in a little. And it's clear that pothead kid of his is breaking his heart. "Why anybody would want to smoke pot is beyond me," Blaine added. "Doesn't that kid know that stuff is going to rot his brain? At 3 a.m., Schultz used his last quarter to call home and wake up Ellen for a ride, explaining that he's already gotten picked up for two DUIs. "Who's going to drive my wife to work in the morning so we can pay some bills? " Schultz asked. "That stoner son of mine? I don't think so.

Repressed-Memory Therapist Recovers Rockford Files Episode
OTTUMWA, IA — After months of hypnotherapy, local repressed-memory therapist Brian Marnard has helped Joan Spees, a 37-year-old farm-equipment sales consultant, recover an entire Rockford Files episode from the darkest reaches of her subconscious mind. "Joan, who had suffered from seemingly inexplicable anxiety attacks her entire adult life, was the perfect candidate for repressed-memory therapy," Marnard said Monday. "Under my care, she began recovering vivid memory flashes from what seemed to be a single, distinct episode from her past. The images included an old-fashioned answering machine turning on in an empty room, a gold Firebird experiencing a sudden, violent change in direction, and a dark-haired man walking on the beach. In spite of the memory's persistent nature, Joan could not see how the fragments were related. Spees said that, although the flashbacks would intrude upon her waking hours accompanied by the same "catchy snippet" of music, they did little to disrupt her personal life. Nonetheless, Marnard was concerned about what the memories might signify. "Repressed memories, which are stored outside the awareness of the conscious mind, can usually be traced back to a traumatic event," Marnard said. "What if Joan had been the victim of childhood sexual abuse by the dark-haired man she felt was named James, Jim, Garner, or Rockford? If so, she needed to bring these memories to the fore and confront them. For two months, Marnard engaged Spees in an exhaustive, expensive course of drug-mediated interviews, hypnosis, regression therapy, and literal dream interpretation. "Brian said my scraps of recollection were probably part of something bigger, an incident at least 44 minutes long — one that might be part of a larger chain of similar events from my adolescence," Spees said. "Brian kept encouraging me to pursue my vague feeling that the man I was seeing was a criminal, even though I felt even more strongly that the mysterious figure could be trusted. According to Marnard, Spees' first few sessions progressed little beyond her strong memory of lying on her family's living room floor. "I'm 8… I'm wearing my Pooh pajamas… wrapped in an olive-green blanket…" a transcript of Spees' first session read. "A phone's ringing, but it's not mine… I'm waiting for someone to answer the phone… There's a message…. An important message about someone picking up the car from the garage? No, it's a woman saying she's lonely… no, it's a pizza shop. I'm not sure…" At that point in the session, Spees would usually whistle a distinctive melody. "It was a long time before I got any more out of her," Marnard said. "But finally, Joan was able to recover some very strong memories, like the image of a murder suspect who supposedly died in a car accident. And something about an angel trying to get his money back from a swindler who was on the run from the mob. And then, there was a garbage disposal jammed by a missing bullet. "Still," Marnard added. "She was never able to fully understand what was going on. Finally, near the end of a one-hour 'deep therapy' session, Spees had a breakthrough. "I was about to bring Joan out of it, when she started talking in a deep voice, like that of a father figure," Marnard said. "I could feel we were reaching a climax. That's when she said, 'Honey, we're all scared to death. I guess that's the price we pay for living in a world where we sell cemetery plots on billboards by the freeway and all the prices end in 99 cents. What you gotta do is just keep laughing.' Marnard said it wasn't until Spees paused and said, "Later tonight on NBC…" that he recognized the quote as coming from Jim Rockford, the laid-back ex-con-turned-detective played by James Garner on the popular '70s TV show, The Rockford Files. In spite of the breakthrough, Dr. Klaus Stenner of the Iowa Psychological Association criticized Marnard's methods, and those of all repressed-memory therapists, calling them unprofessional. "There is no real evidence that childhood memories are ever unconsciously repressed," Stenner said. "In addition, recovering these supposedly repressed memories, whether of sexual abuse or the plots of popular television series, has never led to significant improvement in a patient's psychological health and stability. Luckily, Spees was spared any lasting harm — probably because her memories were innocuous and generally positive, thanks to The Rockford Files' high production values and taut writing. Immediately after the breakthrough, Spees discontinued her twice-weekly visits and refused to pay her outstanding bill, calling Marnard "a quack. " Marnard, however, adamantly insists that Spees should return to therapy. "Joan can run from her problems all she wants, but the haunting, sinister image of the gun in the cookie jar will be with her forever," Marnard said. "And even if she has discovered the source of the mysterious answering-machine messages, it doesn't explain Joan's recurring memories of a shadowy, mustachioed figure known only as 'Higgins.'"

Local Self-Storage Facility A Museum Of Personal Failure
CHICAGO — Located in the Bucktown neighborhood, American Mini-Storage is one of Chicago's best-kept secrets, but don't expect it to stay that way for long. The self-storage facility houses what is arguably the nation's most impressive collection of personal items accumulated during periods of failure. "There are 250 storage units here, and each one has a different pathetic story to tell," said Carlos Garcia, one of several client-relations managers at American Mini-Storage. "They run the gamut — from libraries of unread college textbooks to abandoned bolts of canvas to half-restored antique chests of drawers. Each storage locker is like a window into a separate life of disappointment and inadequacy. American Mini-Storage opened on Armitage Street in autumn of 1996. Despite being relatively new to the market, facility managers have amassed an impressive collection, thanks to location, word of mouth, and generous contributions from anonymous donors. "We have the largest collection of NordicTracks in North America, perhaps even the world," Garcia said. "Just by browsing the units, you can chart the evolution of the device — from rather simplistic machines to complex models with built-in cardio monitors. "Public favor shifts, of course," Garcia added. "I anticipate a boom in the number of Bowflex home gyms permanently installed here in coming years. The facility has a children's wing, housing dozens of unfinished model cars and airplanes, aquariums and Habitrails from pets long dead from neglect, and hideous ceramic art projects. "This is a classic example of youthful failure," said Garcia, holding up a D-minus paper titled "Our First President George Washington" by Timmy Keadle. "This stack of essays is filled with all sorts of factual, spelling, and grammatical errors, but they're written so earnestly. Timmy was obviously trying very hard, but just couldn't nail the basics. This paper expresses a truth central to our facility: Failure knows no age limit. "And this is only one of scores of papers we have just like it on site," Garcia added. The storage units measure 6' x 6' x 7'. Curated individually by American Mini-Storage customers, each holds unique contents. Leading a tour through the B wing, Garcia gestured to several private galleries. "This is the Mueller space," Garcia says. "It holds a crate of five partially written detective novels. And over here in the Sherman room, we have one of my favorite collections: the leftover inventory from a failed salad-dressing business. Oh, and take a look inside the Curtis collection. It boasts the decaying remains of an entire family's failure, including a sixth-place intramural-tennis trophy, a moth-eaten gymnastics uniform, and a file cabinet jammed with overdraft bank notices. The facility features one of the nation's largest collections of fashions from the late 20th century. "Our collection includes dozens of mint-condition size-6 dresses and never-been-worn swimwear," Garcia said. "Much of the clothing is displayed with beta aerobics tapes and long-abandoned diet journals. Of particular interest is the musical wing, holding hundreds of long-deserted instruments. "Nothing evokes dashed hopes like music," Garcia said. "In addition to the usual drums, guitars, and amplifiers abandoned after going-nowhere bands broke up, we have several trombones that came to us following the ska period. "Oh, this is interesting," added Garcia, gesturing to 14 small boxes. "This is one of our most recent acquisitions. The boxes contain 495 copies of the first CD by a musician called Moldy Dick. All but three CDs are still in their shrink-wrap, and the three unwrapped ones were actually signed by the artist. It's heart-wrenching." Like any curator, Garcia makes sure the items in his charge are kept in a climate-controlled environment to preserve their integrity. And like any curator, Garcia prefers certain exhibits. "This is one of my personal favorites," said Garcia, sliding open the door to unit 235. "Look at the sparseness of the arrangement here — 252 cubic feet available, and the customer has stored only two boxes, stacked one on top of the other. There's a Zen-like quality to the arrangement. One box holds women's clothing, the other photographs and letters, both of which seem to have once belonged to an ex-girlfriend. They've been here for six years, and the guy keeps paying the rent. Makes your head swim with possible scenarios of failure. While the storage facility is by no means the only one of its kind, several factors have contributed to the breadth of its fascinating collection. "Part of the reason for our success is that the neighborhood itself has been in drastic flux over the past 15 years," Garcia said. "As a result of Bucktown's gentrification, the Puerto Rican population has been displaced, followed by the artists and musicians, then the people on the first steps to their career. Everyone who has come and gone has needed a place to store painful reminders of the past. We are not just a storage facility, we are a repository for every imaginable setback a person can experience.

Cupid Shooting Spree Leaves Dozens Infatuated
CHICAGO — Dozens of innocent citizens were infatuated Monday, when a winged angel of romantic inspiration — or "Cupid" — drew his magical bow and opened fire on a crowd at Lincoln Park, striking an as-yet-undetermined number of people directly in their hearts during a 13-minute enchanted-arrow shooting spree. "I was just walking along the sidewalk when I saw this chubby, winged guy wearing some sort of diaper, pointing a red-tipped arrow in my direction," said Steve Kremms, an insurance adjuster who was pierced by love's dart during Monday's incident. "I didn't really know what was happening. I barely had time to shout 'Down!' and wrestle this mousy librarian-type to the ground before I started stammering and feeling light-headed. Her name is Jackie and she writes poetry… We both come to this park a lot, but I'd never noticed her before, even though she has these amazing eyes. "It was just so senseless, so out of nowhere, like a bolt of lightning," Kremms added. "Girls do like getting flowers, right? That isn't just a myth? God, I'm no good at this. Police responded within 90 seconds of the incident. Some were caught in the crossfire. "I haven't seen anything like it in my 13 years on the force, and only a few things like it since high school," said Detective Jim McClancy, one of the first officers on the scene. "Pairs of people were lying on the grass, on park benches, sitting on the curb, everywhere. They were giggling, murmuring sweet nothings… some were even moaning a little. I felt so… helpless — we knew the shooter was still in the park somewhere. I'll never forget how my heart almost stopped when my partner Julio, a guy I've served with for half my career, turned to me and said, 'Do you feel like getting some Chinese?'" Amateur video shot at the scene shows the apple-cheeked cherub firing bolt after heart-tipped bolt into the crowd. Those hit reacted immediately by clasping their hands between their knees, casting their eyes downward, and digging their toes sheepishly in the dirt. In some cases, the victims hid their eyes altogether and grinned vacuously at absolutely nothing. Although the tape has not yet been aired on television, authorities plan to do so as soon as soft-focus filtration effects are added and the footage is overdubbed with the Gary Wright ballad "Dream Weaver." No arrests have been made, but police are currently rounding up local personifications of love's sudden and unpredictable onset. At least three winged, shirtless, cherubic residents of neighboring Winnetka and Mundelein are being kept in police custody as "persons of interest. No motive has yet been given for the shootings, but forensic romantics speculate that the unusually benevolent spring weather and warm, breezy day may have played a part in the shooter's actions. Police do not yet have an exact count of the victims struck by what they call "the heart's sweet, sweet wound," but at least six people were smitten seriously enough to rush themselves to emergency suites at area hotels, from which none have yet emerged. Determining the extent of the shooting will most likely be difficult, experts say, due to the tendency of those affected to strenuously deny their infatuation while simultaneously refusing to seek treatment, in some cases actually resisting all offers of assistance and withdrawing from human contact for weeks. "It's way too early to fully understand this wonderful shooting," said Anna Gardner, a relationship therapist working to help shooting victims get up the nerve to confess their feelings to one another. "People are going to come forward for weeks, talking about this memorable day. Roger, this very sweet man I met at the scene, said sometimes the enchanted arrow hits so hard, the victims don't realize they've been struck. "He also said I have cute toes," added Gardner. "Such a thing to say! Can you imagine? Although the victims' reactions varied from blushing reticence to giggling denial to erratic behavior such as singing under other victims' windows, the total number of those lovestruck in the attack may never be accurately determined. Early reports indicate that as many as 24 people were exhibiting obvious signs of distraction and giddiness, and perhaps a dozen more were refusing to leave the sides of other victims. Crisis-center representatives report that they are being flooded with calls inquiring about the welfare of possible victims, asking whether said victims have mentioned the callers in any way, and wondering if the hotline operator would agree to speak to the victims on the callers' behalf. As of press time, at least three Chicago-area couples are missing and presumed wed.

Inner-City Community Bands Together To Find Missing Parent
DETROIT — In a heartwarming display of community feeling, members of the Delray neighborhood in southwest Detroit have banded together to find Milo Patterson, 38, the latest parent to vanish in the string of mysterious abductions that has plagued the area. Patterson, an avid sports fan and a father of three who had recently enrolled in an auto-mechanic training program, disappeared April 3, shortly after a disagreement with his wife Janine. He is 5'8", of medium build, and was last seen wearing a Tommy Hilfiger windbreaker, jeans, and tan work boots. He has a tattoo of the Michelin Man on his left bicep. "Whatever is going on, it's terrifying," said Clarissa Williams, who lives in the same housing complex as the missing father and has made her apartment a home base for the building's search efforts. "It couldn't be a worse time for this tragedy. Milo's got kids, a girlfriend he mighta knocked up, and from what I've been hearing, he owes money to just about everybody. "We have no idea if Milo was abducted, or if he's lying hurt somewhere," Williams said. "All we know is that he disappeared without one word to his kids, his wife, or his boss down at Speedy Lube." Williams said she has spent the past week collecting recent photos of Patterson and covering the area between Fort Street and the Detroit River with "missing parent" signs. "Milo, wherever you are, don't worry! " Williams said. "We'll find you. At an organizational meeting held Tuesday at the Christ the Redeemer Church, volunteers divided themselves into three search parties and began combing the neighborhood for clues. "First place we checked was the Velvet Room over on Sunset," said longtime Delray resident Alfredrick Brussard. "But the bartender said he hadn't seen Milo all week. Then we went over to the Checker Bar & Grill, where he likes to go for happy hour, and his friend Art's apartment, where he watches the games. "We also sent a search party down to the Freddy's Towing parking lot and around by those picnic tables in Lincoln Park," Brussard continued. "Well, there wasn't any trace of him anywhere. It's like he vanished into thin air. Patterson's wife Janine Ordonez explained that, before alerting police to the case, she made sure that he was really missing. "I'm used to him disappearing now and again for a spell," said Ordonez, tears welling up in her eyes. "But when my payday came around and he didn't even show up, I said, 'Lord Jesus, my baby's gone.' Neighborhood resident Clive Delapaz said he and friends held a candlelight prayer vigil on Friday for the missing man. "It's important not to lose hope," Delapaz said. "God works in mysterious ways, and Milo's disappearance is all a part of His plan. We must have faith. Hardware-store clerk Moses Mitchell, 58, led Monday's second-shift search party. "In an emergency situation, it's important not to panic," Mitchell said. "I told everyone to stay calm. Especially Milo's mother — she was fixing to move in with him and Janine." Detroit police officer Aubrayo Venzetti said the 4th Precinct has been working around the clock to find Patterson. "We're doing everything we can to find this man," Venzetti said. "We've contacted federal authorities, but they seem reluctant to send additional assistance. Surprisingly, even local TV and radio stations have been slow to get involved. As they wait for help, local community members continue their efforts. Tedaryl Kudrow, who owns a liquor store frequented by the missing man, has placed Patterson's photo on the front of his cash register. "I'm doing what I can, and that's not just 'cause Milo was a good customer," Kudrow said. "Sad thing is, abductees are not the only victims in an abduction. What will happen to the children these kidnappers have left fatherless? For the sake of those kids, we have got to find Milo." Patterson is the 53rd adult to go missing in the Delray neighborhood this year.

1998 Powerball Winner Returns To Food-Service Job
RAPID CITY, SD — In spite of winning an $18-million Powerball jackpot in 1998, William Berringer, 39, insisted on returning to his line-cook job at Nelson's Steak House Tuesday. "Winning all that money didn't change me," Berringer said. "I'm still the same Bill Berringer that I was before I hit the jackpot, then proceeded to spend it all on partying, bad stocks, and a Jamaican condominium. " Berringer added that he hopes everyone at work will treat him the same way they always did, or at least the ones who were there when he quit his job the day after he won the jackpot.

Boyfriend Keeps Bringing Up Scrabble Victory
PLYMOUTH, NH — Evan Riedel has made reference to his Dec. 20 Scrabble victory over girlfriend Amy Vanderploeg "about 200 friggin' times" in the days since, Vanderploeg reported Monday. "Evan will not let that Scrabble game drop," Vanderploeg, 23, said. "Constantly, he'll say stuff like, 'Do you need help reading that magazine article? I know your vocabulary isn't the best, judging from that round of Scrabble we played.' Give it up already, Evan." The oft-alluded-to match, which took place at Vanderploeg's apartment, was a decisive 382-183 victory for Riedel, who needed less than one hour to dispense with his girlfriend of three years. Upon winning, he performed a brief victory dance and began verbally taunting his vanquished opponent — behavior that has continued unabated nearly two weeks later. "He works the word 'esteemed' into conversation whenever possible and then says, 'Gee, I really like that word 'esteemed,'" Vanderploeg said. "He was so proud that he'd used up those four e's in one word and used all seven tiles. Vanderploeg added that by placing "esteemed" across a triple-word-score spot on the board and earning a 50-point bonus for using all his letters, Riedel was able to, in his words, "rack up a sweet 77" on the turn. In addition to constantly bringing up his best moves, Riedel has relished pointing out errors Vanderploeg made during the game. "Whenever we see a cat now, he goes, 'C-A-T… Cat!' as a way of making fun of me for putting down such a simple word at one point," Vanderploeg said. "Then he usually says, 'You know where cats like to walk? On the catwalk!' That's because instead of putting down 'cat,' I could've added my 'cat' onto the word 'walk' that was already on the board and gotten a lot more points. Vanderploeg said she should have anticipated Riedel's post-victory arrogance on the basis of his behavior during the game. "Evan was getting way too into it," she said. "At one point, he got a double-word score and actually screamed, 'Boo-ya!''' By the midpoint of the game, Riedel had developed an elaborate tile-picking ritual, shaking the bag vigorously before blowing into it and chanting, "Come on, come on, please… gimme the Xs, Js, and Zs!" According to Vanderploeg, such theatrics made it difficult for her to concentrate on the game and contributed to her poor showing. "There were several times when I put down the first thing I thought of, just to get the stupid thing over with faster," Vanderploeg said. "Every time it was my turn, Evan would lean across the board and stare at me. It started to get really annoying, but whenever I told him to stop, he'd say, 'What's the matter? Can't take the heat?' According to noted psychologist Dr. Eli Wasserbaum, Riedel's behavior is rooted in his outsider status during childhood. "Awkward and ungainly as a boy, Evan never excelled in athletics," Wasserbaum said. "He did, however, find shelter in academia. It is natural, then, that he is most comfortable asserting his male competitive instincts in this arena. His frequent allusion to the Scrabble victory can be likened to a male peacock extending his colorful tail plumage before the female bird. With his constant boasting, Evan is not actually trying to annoy his girlfriend but instead impress her and win her approval. Riedel has engaged in boardgame-victory braggadocio in the past, carrying on about triumphs in such games as Trivial Pursuit, Balderdash, and Outburst. "One time, we were playing Scattergories with [longtime couple] Jeff [Weitz] and Kimberly [Alford], and Evan got so bad, I had to cut the game short," Vanderploeg said. "We didn't see them for, like, three months after that. While Riedel admits to mentioning the Scrabble victory frequently, he denies any wrongdoing. "I'm just teasing Amy, is all," Riedel said. "Besides, I can't help it if I possess a superior vocabulary and stellar word-formation skills. Ka-ching!"

Area Mom Freaking Out For No Reason Again
GALESBURG, IL — Area mother of three Mary Kleibert, 54, was once again freaking out for no reason Tuesday, sources within the Kleibert family reported. "All I did was mention that I had to go to the DMV because my license was going to expire the next day, and mom completely wigged," said Tim Kleibert, 18, the youngest son of the freaking-out woman. "She started totally spazzing, saying, 'What if they're closed? Then what?' and telling me that the police were going to impound my car if I drove it. I was like, 'Mom, relax.' Upon learning of her son's 11th-hour license-renewal plan, Kleibert reportedly went seriously buggo, excitedly listing off the various potential problems he obviously hadn't even taken the time to consider. "What if you don't pass your vision test? " Mary Kleibert asked. "Or what if the DMV paperwork needs more than 24 hours to clear, and you're not eligible to drive until Thursday? Your father can't drive you to work tomorrow, you know: He'll be in Moline all day. Her breathing rate audibly increasing, Kleibert reminded her son that if his driver's license is invalid, his car insurance policy would be, too. She described such a scenario as one she doesn't "even want to think about. Over the next five minutes, Kleibert became more agitated, despite her son's repeated assertion that renewing one's license on the last day is not a federal offense or anything. Tuesday's driver's-license incident is just one of 15 freak-outs to occur in the past month. On Dec. 26, Kleibert went nuts when she discovered that Tim had thrown away the packaging for his new laptop computer. "What if something goes wrong? " Kleibert, near tears, told her son. "You can't just call in the washing-machine repairman to fix it. Don't you care about your things at all? " She then noisily stomped down the basement steps carrying a laundry basket. Kleibert went similarly hyper last Thursday, when Tim accidentally overslept, leaving him just 25 minutes to get to his job at a local grocery store. He was awakened by Kleibert, who yelled, "It's quarter after! Do you hear me? Quarter after! " Ten minutes later, as Tim pulled out of the driveway, Kleibert stood on the front steps, shouting, "You've got to eat breakfast! You can't just not eat! According to husband Gerald Kleibert, 56, no one in the family is safe from the freak-outs, which range in subject from the dangers of mechanical devices to the threat of food poisoning, with special attention given to heat exhaustion, blood clots, and hems. On Dec. 28, Gerald himself prompted his wife to flip out when he forgot to lock the empty house before running out for a newspaper, leaving the door wide open for anyone, in Kliebert's words, to "waltz off with whatever they could carry. "Boy, oh, boy," Gerald said. "Mary really blew a gasket over that one. Three days later, Kleibert went into another tizzy upon discovering that Gerald had failed to plan ahead for their nephew's wedding. Too late to request the day off from work, he called in sick with "the flu" in order to attend the event. As a result of her husband's failure to plan ahead, Kleibert nervously watched the door all night, fearful that someone from her husband's workplace would wander into the wedding reception by accident. The most baffling of Kleibert's outbursts, family members said, are those involving her two eldest children, neither of whom still live at home. Without warning or provocation, Kleibert will fret loudly about Jason, 24, who "insists on flying everywhere" despite all the airplane accidents on the news, and 22-year-old Erin, who just wanders around from one job to another without getting enough protein. Despite the preponderance of evidence suggesting otherwise, Tim said he maintains hope that when he leaves for college in August, his mother will acknowledge his adult status and not go batshit-loonball on him so much. "She's a good mom, and I love her," Tim said. "But, man, she seriously needs to learn to chill.

Weed Delivery Guy Saves Christmas
MADISON, WI — The holidays evoke images of carolers and hot cocoa, sleigh rides through the crisp country air, and chestnuts roasting on an open fire. But for the four residents of a drafty little apartment on Johnson Street, such holiday traditions seemed nothing more than fairy tales. For, through a combination of poverty, circumstance, and plain old bad luck, these young gentlemen nearly saw their holiday dreams shattered like so many fallen ornaments. Almost, but not quite. For although there would be no Yule log in the fireplace, a crackling blaze of another kind would come to warm the hearts of the hapless roommates. For, these four lucky friends had a guardian angel watching over them, and this is the heartwarming true story of how the weed delivery guy saved Christmas. "Dude, I was so bummed when I found out my stupid supervisor scheduled me for first shift Christmas Eve," said Patrick Moynihan, 26, a "part-time musician and full-time phone drone. " "I was like, 'Come on, I gotta go to Milwaukee to see my old man and watch the game.' He was like, 'Sorry man, life's rough. You should've remembered to ask off.' "It's not like Milwaukee's so great," Moynihan added, "but it beats spending Christmas alone in my shithole apartment. But, in a turn of events Moynihan described as "X-Files-type shit," each of his remaining roommates — first Dirk, then Kleist, and finally even White Jimmy — watched their Christmas plans come undone, leaving the four housemates together in Madison on the night before Christmas. "I was supposed to go home with this chick and meet her parents," said Dirk Udell, 24, a part-time bicycle-store clerk and bassist. "But we totally got into this huge fight the night before, and she was like, 'Sayonara, sweetheart.' Then Kleist got wasted and slept through his flight, and White Jimmy's credit card got turned down at the bus station, because he maxed it out on that amp he bought. Individual heartbreak turned into collective joy when the roommates realized that they could have their own Christmas… together. "We said, 'Fuck it,'" James "White Jimmy" Gaines said. "We were like, 'We have all the ingredients for old-time holiday cheer right here: some brews, the tube, and the Chinese place across the street that never closes on holidays.' We even cleaned the living room and washed the dishes. Then fate threw a monkey wrench. "Dudes, it's a no go," Kleist said before delivering the bad news. "Carl totally flaked on us. He left for Michigan already. The roommates' faces turned ashen: There would be no Christmas weed. "I was, like, 'No way, man!' " Moynihan said. "Kleist even called all our friends, trying to find someone who was holding, but everyone was out of town. We tried to drum up some Christmas cheer, but there was no escaping the sad reality that the four of us had all this time to hang out, but no pot. Disconsolate, the roommates went through the motions of scraping the bowl for resin. But, in their hearts, they knew that it wasn't enough to get them high. Peering out of the fourth-floor window, gazing at the municipal streetlight decorations below, they felt that Christmas had deserted them… Or had it? "That's when Jimmy — I think it was Jimmy. It could've been Kleist — wait, was it Jimmy or Kleist?" Moynihan said. "Aw, never mind — whoever it was looked up and said, 'Hey Dirk, why don't we try the number that that guy who worked at Big Mike's Subs gave you?' After searching high and low with the help of his three determined roommates, Udell located the piece of paper containing the phone number given to him by his old stoner buddy Javier. "Javier told me he hardly knows the dealer, but the guy always has really great shit and he comes right over," Udell said. "Kleist was all like, 'Who in their right mind is gonna be out delivering weed on Christmas Eve?' But I was like, 'What would it hurt to give the number a try?' "We were so psyched when he answered his cell on the second ring! " Udell added. The roommates busily prepared for the weed guy's arrival by laying out Chips Ahoy cookies on paper plates, loading disks into the CD changer, and lovingly placing a new screen in the bong. All the while, they listened for the crunch-crunch-crunch of his footsteps on the snowy walk and the jingle-jangle-jingle of the Apt. 4-D buzzer. They even put the porch light on for the dude, so he'd feel welcome. And when, in less than an hour, the weed delivery guy showed up bearing a gift more precious than gold, the roommates' hearts soared with joy. "That stranger brought us something so much better than any store-bought gift," Moynihan said. "I don't know his name — it's considered bad form to ask — but he taught us that Christmas wishes can come true, if you believe. And so it was that the weed delivery guy — hardworking, dedicated, and discreet — saved Christmas in the nick of time. "We may not have had a big tree and all that," Moynihan said. "And there wasn't eggnog dusted with nutmeg, 'cause the only time we ever had any nutmeg in the house was the time we tried to trip on it. Not recommended, by the way. But we had a happy Christmas all the same. It wasn't long before all through the house, not a creature was stirring up off the couch. The boys opened the baggie and packed a bowl with delight, murmuring, "Happy Christmas, weed delivery guy. You did us one right.

Oysters Have No Discernible Effect On Date
SEATTLE — According to Justin Grammling, 24, a close inspection of date Karen Stavers, who ate a six-oyster appetizer platter, indicated no marked increase in her libido. "Those things didn't do shit," Grammling said. "She didn't inch closer to me, or play footsie, or take her sweater off. I was keeping an eye on her, and her color didn't even rise.

Family Secret Turns Out To Be Boring
MINNETONKA, MN — After nearly 30 years of subterfuge, Michael Henderson's parents Doug and Pam broke down and revealed their painful family secret, which turned out to be unbelievably boring, their son reported Monday. "Ever since I was a kid, Mom and Dad have avoided talking about their first couple years of marriage," said the 28-year-old Henderson, who visited his parents last weekend. "My sisters and I knew they lived in Indiana for two years, but we never knew why they moved back to Minnesota. Eventually, we started wondering if it was something too horrible to talk about. Who would've imagined it was such a non-story after all that drama? According to Henderson, whenever he asked his parents about Indiana, they responded in a "vague, noncommittal way, then changed the subject. "Once, I asked Dad what his first job was, and he refused to answer," Henderson said. "He basically acted like he had been a spy or a drug dealer or something. When Henderson's parents finally revealed the mysterious truth during a teary, post-dinner confession Saturday, Henderson said he was shocked not by the revelation, but by its mundanity. "Last Thanksgiving, I asked Aunt Janet what the deal was, and even she got all agitated," Henderson said. "The real story is so mild and silly that I'm almost embarrassed to say what it was. After a pause, Henderson continued: "Okay, ready? Here it is: Dad got kicked out of the Air Force for stealing a motorcycle. According to Henderson, the years of secrecy had fueled intense speculation, with him and his sisters Joyce and Randi dreaming up scenarios ranging from the tragic to the truly horrific. "I was imagining all this crazy stuff," Hendeson said. "Was he involved in an anti-establishment bombing of a campus building that resulted in an accidental death? Did it have something to do with the scar on his stomach? Does he have a whole different family somewhere? Was there an uncle who died in a mysterious hunting accident after Dad caught him making out with Mom? That kind of thing. None of the hypotheses turned out to be even remotely close to the mundane story of motorcycle theft, which did not even result in any jail time. "Well, it turns out the scar is from an appendectomy, Mom and Dad never even dated anyone else before they got married, and Dad's been an actuary ever since leaving the Air Force," Henderson said. "In fact, I'm pretty sure the motorcycle incident is the most exciting thing that ever happened to either of them. Henderson said the truth came out during a late-night conversation that "took place over a few too many brandy eggnogs. " Basking in the glow of the fireplace, the parents broke down and told their son the burning secret they had kept hidden for so long. "It was really emotionally trying for them to finally come clean," Henderson said. "That's why I feel so bad that I still couldn't keep from laughing. In the confession, Doug explained that he and Pam were 19, married, and living together in military housing. One night, Doug got drunk and accepted a dare to race five circles around the base on a motorcycle that had been left running outside the PX. Unfortunately, he was apprehended by military police on his second lap. "The funniest part is, he didn't even steal it, really," Henderson said. "He and some buddies got drunk, and he went for a joyride. It was a run-of-the-mill story of kids blowing off steam. I kept waiting for Dad to get to the good part, but it never came. Continued Henderson: "I mean, who didn't get drunk and do something stupid at 19? I totaled Dad's car when I was a senior in high school and even broke my collarbone. You don't see me hiding it. According to Henderson, his parents had tears in their eyes when they related the boring tale. In spite of his disappointment, he said there was a bright side: Both of his parents appeared "as if a weight had been lifted from their shoulders" after the confession. "For the rest of the weekend, they were a lot more relaxed," Henderson said. "To me, it was such a non-event that, when we went to the mall the next day and passed a parked motorcycle, I almost said, 'Dad, is that thing safe around you?' But I thought better of it, thank God. I don't think he would've forgiven me. Henderson said his parents made him promise never to tell his sisters. "Of course, I went right out to the garage with my cell phone and called Joyce and Randi," Henderson said. "I mean, come on!

Petulant 12-Year-Old Refuses To Brown The Ground Chuck
SCOTTSDALE, AZ — In spite of repeated requests from his mother, 12-year-old John Farina refused to brown the ground chuck Monday. "With the things I do around here, I ask you to do one thing to help me get dinner ready, and even that's too much," Farina's mother Karen yelled at the wall of her son's bedroom, where he had been playing a video game since returning from school. "And I don't care if you don't want taco casserole — it's your sister's turn to pick. You chose sloppy joes yesterday, so deal with it. " Family sources report that Farina acceded to his mother's hamburger-related demands as soon as she introduced the alternate threat of washing the lettuce.

Teen Gives Up Smoking Pot After Seeing Parents High
DEDHAM, MA — Elyssa Schuster, 16, swore Monday that she will never again experiment with marijuana after coming home to "obviously baked" parents Harold and Judy Saturday night. "I used to think smoking pot made you look cool, but, boy, was I wrong," Schuster said. "Dad got all paranoid about the mortgage rate while Mom spent an hour giggling about how dusty the ceiling fan was. It was so sad and depressing.

TOPEKA, KS — Jim Bauer, 34, accidentally signed up for AOL Latino, the sales clerk reported Monday. "The sign-up had all these steps, and I guess I just started clicking 'yes' and 'I agree,'" Bauer said.

Recently Married Man Ready To Start Dating Again
BIRMINGHAM, AL — Nearly 14 months after he said "I do" to his new wife Karen, attorney Robert Diehl, 36, told reporters that he finally feels ready to return to the dating world. "For a long time, I wasn't there yet," Diehl said Monday. "After the wedding, all I wanted was to be alone with my wife. I couldn't even look at another woman without comparing her to Karen. But now, I'm finally ready to take a deep breath and throw myself back into the dating pool. Diehl began dating Karen Gurnett in June 2000, and they married on Aug. 16, 2003. Although it has been more than 14 months since Diehl has been with a woman other than Gurnett, he expressed confidence that he'll be able to "get back out there and mix it up. "Sure, it's going to be rough for a while," Diehl said. "But I can't let fear hold me back. I know that once I'm back in the saddle, it'll feel perfectly natural. In addition to the emotional difficulties associated with starting to date again, Diehl said his marital responsibilities leave him with little free time. "This past year has been an incredible drain on my time, energy, and emotions," Diehl said. "Now that Karen and I have unwrapped all the gifts, opened a joint checking account, and bought a house, I finally have some time to focus on me — on what I want. And what I want right now is hot, attachment-free sex with young, good-looking women. Diehl said his wife's recent decision to travel to Atlanta led him to ask himself what he was waiting for. "I have two choices — either ask that cute girl from my gym for a date, or sit at home feeling sorry for myself while Karen's out of town on business next weekend," Diehl said. "I'm through with wallowing in my own misery. Diehl credits his male friends with providing the support he needed to motivate himself to get out and date again. "My buddies have been great," Diehl said. "I was feeling like I had nothing to offer a woman, being married and all. But my friends encouraged me to ditch the negative attitude. I'm still young, and, according to the guys, nothing attracts pussy like a young, successful guy with a wedding ring. Joel Brentmacher, who served as best man at Diehl's wedding, said it was hard to watch his friend endure such a difficult time. "Rob used to be such a ladies' man," Brentmacher said. "It had to be a huge blow to him when his single life ended. We hated to see him closing himself off to all the other women in Birmingham and the surrounding counties just because he found a wife. But we gave him time and didn't pressure him. We knew he had to come back on the scene when he felt he was ready. Although Diehl expressed excitement about dating again, he said he plans to "play it smart. "There are so many good-looking women out there. I'd love to spend my lunch hour in a hotel room with all of them," Diehl said. "If I were 18 again, I might try. But I'm more mature now, and I have some experience under my belt. I'm going to ease into things. The best course of action is to take this thing one mistress at a time. Diehl said his wife, whom he "will always love with all [his] heart," will be in his thoughts as he ventures out into the dating world. "Over these past few months, I've had time to do some really serious thinking about Karen," Diehl said. "I think I have it all straight in my mind as to how I'll be able to cheat on her without her catching me. "I have to take the whole thing slow, though," Diehl added. "I don't want to get hurt, and Karen would kill me if she ever found out.

Junior Building Inspector Closes Down Tree House
BLOOMINGTON, IN — Junior building inspector Thomas Spengler, 8, ordered the closure of a tree house owned by Jimmy Herman Monday. "The tree house will remain closed until improvements are made to its structure," Spengler said. "The rope ladder leading up to the house needs to be brought into compliance with local building codes. Also, the structural integrity of the clubhouse, wedged as it is into Old Man Kessler's oak tree, is compromised by the hastily added lookout post. " Spengler threatened to close the tree house permanently should Herman fail to bring its tire swing up to code.

Bargoer Starts To Hit Stride After Hitting On Fifth Girl
JACKSONVILLE, FL — Brad Framik, a contract attorney at Russell Law Offices and self-described "player," announced Saturday that he was "starting to hit my stride" after unsuccessfully coming on to five women at the Red Rock nightclub. "My game wasn't focused during those first few rounds, but now I'm on a roll," Framik said. "If that tall chick's friends hadn't dragged her out, I would've had her for sure. See, it takes a while to work up to peak performance level. Although he doesn't go out much during the week, Framik said he likes to "hit the clubs" every Friday and Saturday, usually with a group of five or more male friends also hoping to meet women. "Then, on Sundays, we go golfing and compare our pussy-hunt scores," Framik said. "It's important to have fun and blow off steam on the weekend when you have such a demanding, high-paying job. It's a stress reliever, like yoga. Framik's coworker Nick Gregivich usually joins the group. "We may wear suits all day, but we know how to cut loose after hours," said Gregivich, 28."You should see Framik bust a move on the dance floor. It's like, 'Yow!'" When asked about his dance technique, Framik elaborated. "My signature move is to locate some chick I wouldn't mind breaking it off in," Framik said. "Then I sidle over to her section of the dance floor and circle like a shark, waiting for the right moment to strike. When she least expects it, I lock eyes with her and mouth the words 'I want you.' Shrugging, Framik added, "Hey, dude, chicks like silly stuff like that — sometimes it works. When asked why he wasn't making a favorable impression at the beginning of the evening, Framik said he had "started out slow. "I didn't do so well with the first five babes I approached, but a guy's gotta warm up," Framik said. "The love muscle is like any other muscle — you've got to stretch and loosen up first before you do the heavy lifting. That's why it makes sense to hit on three or four stuck-up chicks first, so you can play a couple practice rounds before the stakes are too high. You can't expect to hit that shit out of the park your first time at bat. When pressed, Framik admitted to making some mistakes during the evening. "Okay, I may have jumped the gun a little with that first chick," Framik said. "I never should've asked her to show me her thong so soon in the conversation. That's the weird thing about chicks. They always want to draw everything out longer than is necessary. I'm a take-charge, fast-paced guy, so it's hard for me to fake being patient. Framik said the nature of the initial rejection made it more difficult for him to "find the pocket" in subsequent attempts at seduction. "After she made that comment about me using sunless tanner, I got a little off-balance," Framik said. "She set me on edge, so I wasn't bringing my 'A' game for the next couple girls. As Framik's unrequited attention-seeking continued, his friends watched his progress from across the bar. According to Framik, this added pressure may have caused him to blow his timing. "I shouldn't have talked to that third chick while my friends were all watching me," Framik said. "Some girls find that sort of thing tacky. But by the fourth at-bat, I thought I'd ironed out the wrinkles. Framik described his next failed come-on attempt. "I was making major eye contact with this brunette in the booth next to ours, but she turned out to be this Iranian chick who didn't speak much English," Framik said. "She was dressed kind of slutty, so that fooled me. She was probably some kind of uptight religious Muslim who's not into getting boned. Usually, I can spot a religious nut from a mile off, but I had the beer goggles on. After the fifth failed attempt, however, Framik finally felt himself "getting into the zone. "Let's just say that I definitely got some digits by the end of the night," said Framik, who estimates that he made between 10 and 15 come-on attempts over the course of the two hours that followed. "I ended up with a pretty respectable success ratio. While Framik described himself as a "master of the elusive female mind," a female coworker disagreed. "Brad and his friends are always talking about how chicks dig this and chicks dig that," said Paula Mannheim, a fellow lawyer. "Listening to them talk, you'd think they've never had a conversation with an actual woman in their entire lives. Asked for his reaction to Mannheim's comments, Framik became curious. "Paula was talking about me? " Framik said. "The one with the nice body? Tell me everything she said, so I can read between the lines.

Older Brother Accused Of Cushion-Fort Prisoner Abuse
PARK CITY, UT — Following a probe into activities that allegedly occurred inside a couch-cushion fort located in the basement of the Nelson home, Keith, 11, has been accused of mistreatment, abuse of power, and sitting on his 8-year-old brother Mark's head for up to two minutes at a time. "What Mark told me was shocking," the boys' mother Elizabeth said Monday. "According to Mark, he and Keith were having fun playing Army until Keith captured Mark — which is what usually happens, because Mark is smaller — and put him inside the fort they'd made in the basement. I thought they were playing nicely down there, but there's nothing nice about noogies. In addition to farting in the fort's entrance and forcing Mark to remain inside, Keith allegedly gave his brother Indian burns, grundies, and a sustained wet willy. Keith also reportedly subjected Mark to Chinese Finger Torture, by restraining him and methodically tapping his forehead until he screamed "uncle." Chinese Finger Torture was specifically outlawed by the Nelson family in December 2003, during talks held at Grandma Keller's house. "I know boys are going to wrestle," Elizabeth said. "But I told Keith never to do that finger-tapping thing. It drives his brother absolutely crazy. The upholstered prison, named "Fort Awesome" by Keith and Mark during a moment of unity, was made of cushions taken from the family's old blue couch and reinforced with several blankets and pillows. Although reportedly "grown-up proof," the fortress was slated for destruction even before the abuse charges were raised. "The fortress was going to have to come down before dinner anyway," Elizabeth said. "But after this, you better believe it was gone. I made Keith march right down there and put everything away. Although he did not witness the incident, Mark's 8-year-old playmate Jacob Oliveri said he can corroborate Mark's psychological-abuse charges. "Once, when we were playing in the woods behind my house, Keith said he wanted to show us something," Oliveri said. "After we'd walked like 10 minutes, he told us to cover our eyes and count to 50 before opening them. When we opened our eyes, Keith was gone. We had to find our own way home. Elizabeth said the stress that Keith has experienced during his first weeks in the sixth grade, and the fact that Mark "can be very bratty," may have contributed to the alleged abuse. "I'm not going to say that Mark is completely innocent," Elizabeth said. "He sometimes gets a little too big for his britches. But that doesn't mean I'm going to look the other way when Keith forces Mark to smell his socks. Keith is older, and he should know better. Elizabeth debriefed the boys' father Paul when he arrived home from work. While Paul pledged that the abuses would not go unpunished, he said he was not overly concerned about the charges. "I had a talk with Keith and told him that he should be setting a better example for his brother," Paul said. "But if you ask me, Liz is overreacting. Boys will be boys. Although things probably did go a little too far, Keith was just playing. That's what big brothers do. And, when Mark reaches the upper grades, he's going to have to take care of himself. He's not going to have his mother to run to every time something happens. Although Keith's PlayStation privileges have been revoked for a week, some experts say that punishment will only create a more hostile home environment. "Taking away PlayStation rights may have been a mistake," said Dr. Ted Nealman, a noted child psychologist. "It's only going to create unnecessary resentment against Mark. Additionally, the public nature of the revocation means that every time the neighbors see siblings engaging in innocent tussling, they're going to sound the alarm. That's unfortunate, because, throughout the neighborhood, older brothers tend to do an excellent job of keeping their younger brothers out of trouble.

This Is Not The Time For Compassion And Healing
Citizens, friends, and neighbors, we have come together today to reflect on recent events which have deeply wounded this community, and which will no doubt resonate with all of us for a long time to come. You are all undoubtedly feeling many complicated emotions right now — anger, confusion, resentment. But I would like for you to keep one thing in mind: This is not the time for compassion and healing. Although Scoutmaster Holland's appalling actions have in some way hurt each and every one of us, we must not offer each other comfort and support. We must not cooperate to get through this difficult time together. Nor should we reflect on those blessings we do have — those of community, family, and friends. Rather, we must act out of petty self-interest and blind, irrational anger. This is no time to turn to each other and share in our grief. This is a time for bitter, divisive accusation. It is a time to say things so terrible, they will give birth to grudges that we'll nurse for decades. This isn't the time to move forward or to forgive past wrongdoings. It is the time to hate, seethe, and wallow. This tragedy could open the doors to change and renewal. We could seize the opportunity to exchange ideas on how to improve and safeguard our children's futures. But instead, let's exchange angry recriminations and engage in childish name-calling. Mrs. Dailey, earlier, you told me that Ms. McInnes was a bad mother. Saying that to me behind her back is one thing, but why not say it again before everyone? As I look around at the anguished, questioning faces in the room, I see a real need for guidance and unity. Well, I'm afraid this is neither the time nor the place for that. For now, we must simply pick ourselves up and carry on with the business of finger-pointing and buck-passing. We must set about — and I'll tell you, I've been doing a whole lot of this — marveling at how certain troop leaders could really be as oblivious as they claim. From this day forward, let us make "alienation" our watchword. Gandhi said that "forgiveness is the attribute of the strong," but I'll bet Gandhi's kid was never touched in the woods on a camping trip. Fine, "allegedly" touched. We have convened this meeting not to console each other, not to find solace in numbers, but to get a good look at the lying, guilty faces of those who should have done something but didn't. Let us unleash our unbridled rage hither and thither until every last bit of acrimony is expressed, which probably won't be any time soon. Mrs. Dailey, could you maybe shut your mouth for three seconds and let me finish? Some among you might be clinging to that old saw "innocent until proven guilty. " To those people, I say, "Where were your high-minded ideals when your best friend and racquetball partner told you that sometimes he didn't trust himself around children, Terry?" Seriously, I'd like an answer to that. Oh, what a surprise. Terry's not here. Terry's probably, what? Polishing his car or buying himself something, like he probably was when his own kid was getting stroked in a field. I'm sorry, but after all, it's what we're here for. Some of you may be asking "Why, God? Why my boy? What did he do to deserve this? " Some of you may be searching your hearts for understanding and insight. Many of you may have turned to God or family. Friends: Abandon fruitless searches. The molesting gym coach isn't inside you. Turn your search for scapegoats and excuses outward… You didn't hear it from me, but I don't think revenge is completely off the table, either. Perhaps, years from now, you will find yourselves at peace with this tragedy, and see that the trials of today gave us strength, which in turn enriched our tomorrows. Who knows, maybe you and Mr. Holland will go bowling together. Or, I know, perhaps you'll put him in charge of a whole bunch of pre-adolescent boys and send them into the woods, huh, Mark? No, you're the son of a bitch, Mark. Any time any place, my friend. That's what I thought. Friends, we must remember that experiences like these show what people are truly made of. I don't know about you, but at the moment, I am made of incandescent fury. I suggest that we look on this as a fresh beginning, a jumping-off point for a new era of loathing and mistrust. Perhaps we can even re-open some old wounds. One thing is certain: The wounds that Mr. Holland opened will not be allowed to heal. To treat those wounds as the inevitable result of a single bad person living among better people would be the real tragedy. Now more than ever, we must put aside the commonality of our shared suffering and focus instead on concentrating our wrath on a single individual. I suggest Helen. Don Kerris

Crush Lasts Entire Bus Ride
CINCINNATI — Administrative assistant and bus rider Perry Stoddard, 25, developed a crush that lasted the duration of the Metro line bus trip from Seven Hills Road to downtown Monday. "Oh my God, she is stunning," Stoddard said, staring at the petite, bookish brunette sitting two seats ahead of him. "And she's reading The Idiot! I wonder if she has a boyfriend. My parents would love her. " Saddened by the woman's exit from the bus two stops before his own, Stoddard resolved to get out on Court Street and find someone else.

Crank Caller Keeps Jerking Local News Team Around
PLATTSBURGH, NY — The Channel 5 Action News Team was duped once again by a crank call to the WPTZ breaking-news hotline Monday. "I should have known it was too good to be true that Jared [Fogle] would be filming a commercial at the Subway on Campus Drive," reporter Graham Johnson announced from the scene of the restaurant. "I knew that British accent seemed familiar, but it wasn't until we'd all jumped out of the van and rushed into the Subway that I figured it out. The same guy called about the escaped ape last week. " Johnson vowed never to ignore his journalistic instincts again.

Hungover Couple Unaware They Broke Up Last Night
MINNEAPOLIS — Area couple Gene Hayter and Amy Peterman spent most of Sunday tenderly helping each other nurse massive hangovers, unaware that they broke up in a bitter, alcohol-fueled rage during the night. "Man, we must've really tore it up, that's all I can say," Hayter said, his voice raw from Jack Daniel's, cigarettes, and, unbeknownst to him, shrieked accusations of infidelity. "I woke up on Amy's couch, of all places, with a beer bottle in my hand and this terrible feeling, like I wanted to cry myself to death. To top things off, when I pulled myself up to go crawl into bed with Amy, I stepped in broken glass. Hayter said that either he or Peterman, whom he started dating in August 2001, must have drunkenly knocked a framed photo of the couple off the coffee table and smashed it all over the bedroom floor. "It's too bad, too, because Ames and I have always considered that particular photo symbolic of our relationship," Hayter said. "I tell you, I must've had a great time last night. I just hope it was worth hosting this fucking hammer party in my skull. Peterman did not remember anything of the breakup, either. Carefully stepping around the piles of debris in the apartment, she attended to her nausea and rubbed an abrasion on her finger where she had yanked off her promise ring in anger. "Oh, my poor head," Peterman said. "I would've liked to have slept off my hangover, but my friend Nora called me at the crack of dawn. She wanted to know if I was 'okay,' and if I knew where Gene was. She kept asking me if I needed to talk. I was, like, 'No, I don't want to talk. My head is killing me.' "She was kinda weirding me out, actually," Peterman added. "Gene says she was probably still drunk. The couple spent the morning staggering around the apartment, surveying the damage. "Why are all of Gene's clothes piled in the middle of the room like that, and what's that smell? " Peterman asked, unaware that she had heaped his clothes on the floor and doused them in lighter fluid. "Did he spill vodka on them or something? God, I feel like shit. Patting each other tenderly and engaging in other forms of non-verbal communication that revealed years of familiarity, the affectionate couple was nothing like the screaming drunks who had spent an hour the night before hashing out their sexual-incompatibility issues in front of a group of mutual friends at their neighborhood bar. "I stopped by expecting to find Amy distraught over the breakup," Peterman's childhood friend Mary Swaney said. "But I walked in and found her and Gene cuddling under a blanket and watching Law & Order. Gene didn't seem to even realize that he had a black eye, let alone who gave it to him. "Gene called to say they wouldn't be meeting the gang for brunch, and I was thinking, 'No duh,'" said Hayter's best friend Jack McVeigh, who had spent 90 minutes the previous night talking Hayter out of heading to the airport and boarding a plane to the mountains. "But when he said he and 'Ames' were just going to eat cinnamon toast and listen to records, I realized they wanted to spend the day making up. "I don't know how to tell him I have his Swiss Army knife," McVeigh added. "I took it off his key ring last night, because I wasn't 100 percent sure he could be trusted with it. As of press time, neither Hayter nor Peterman exhibited the slightest recollection of the emotional content of the drinking binge. "I'm glad I have you, Amy," Hayter said, cuddling closer to Peterman underneath the very blanket he had used to deflect her blows the night before. "I just want to hide from the loud, demanding world and snuggle for the rest of the day. "Me, too," Peterman said, as she bemusedly extracted a letter opener from between the couch cushions. "We can check and see what those 14 answering-machine messages are all about after we're feeling better.

Almost No Effort Made To Stop Kid From Eating Cigarette Butt
HALLOWELL, ME — While waiting for a bus Tuesday, Stan Geraldson watched 2-year-old Jason Kemper pick up a spent cigarette butt and place it in his mouth, but made only a minor attempt to stop him. "Hey, ah, you shouldn't…" Geraldson told Kemper, whose mother was engaged in a conversation a few feet away. "Don't… eat that. " Geraldson said he would have done more to stop Kemper if the item had been fiberglass or something.

Short-Distance Relationship Too Much Work
GASTONIA, NC — After four months together, sales manager Jack Petrakis, 29, and paralegal Justine Froeger, 26, reported Tuesday that dating someone who lives in the same building isn't worth the hassle. "Everyone warned me that these short-distance things never work out," said Froeger, who recently spent a night with a friend in nearby Charlotte just to escape the stifling proximity of her short-distance boyfriend. "But I thought I would be different, that my love would be strong enough to handle the less than 1,000 feet separating Jack from me. Froeger, who lives in a one-bedroom on the fifth floor of Manning Towers, and Petrakis, who occupies a studio on the fourth, met in the building's laundry room last September. "We were both down there waiting for our clothes to dry, so we started to talk," Petrakis said. "It turned out we had a lot in common — we shopped at the same grocery store and worked out at the same gym. At that point, I wasn't thinking about the future and how hard this sort of relationship can be. For several weeks, Froeger and Petrakis enjoyed a protracted honeymoon period, during which the short distance dividing them seemed like an advantage. Friends report that Petrakis and Froeger thought it was adorable to share a mailman, bump into each other near the trash bin, and frequent the same coffeehouse. "At first, Jack would brag about how cool it was to get a midnight 'booty call' from a sexy girl only three doors down and one floor below," Petrakis' friend Doug Maris said. "He was like, 'I don't even need to change out of my pajamas. I just put on slippers, answer the door, and I'm ready for action.' "He's not bragging anymore," Maris continued. "Last week, a bunch of the guys were hanging out at his place when someone knocked on the door. Jack made us all stand there, frozen in place and totally silent, for about five minutes until he could be sure that whoever it was had left. Both Froeger and Petrakis said they began to experience misgivings about the lack of distance dividing them in early December. "When I met Jack, I'd just broken up with this guy from Toledo, so I was really looking forward to dating someone nearby," Froeger said. "Now, I realize that having him so nearby that I can hear him whistling every time he uses the elevator isn't an advantage. And I do mean every time he uses the elevator. Seriously, every single time — that same OutKast song. "Justine is sweet," Petrakis said. "But sometimes it's too much. Once, I stayed at my buddy's house after a late night of drinking. When Justine saw that I hadn't picked up my newspaper from the doormat, she called to make sure I was okay. That's when I started feeling crowded. In addition to infringing on each other's privacy, Froeger and Petrakis said the close proximity removes a level of excitement from the relationship. "Part of the fun of getting involved with someone is immersing yourself in a new environment and experiencing new things," Froeger said. "But staying overnight at someone's place isn't as great when you live on the same block. Our apartments overlook the same exact tree. "Now we have no excuse to make it downtown or anyplace else," Froeger continued. "And believe me, Jack doesn't look for one, either. We just order delivery from the menus we both already know by heart. Petrakis agreed that "things are getting a little stale. "Justine and I kiss goodbye in the morning, then I see her 30 minutes later in the parking lot," Petrakis said. "Then I get home, and boom! There she is in the elevator. I don't know what to do. I've told her that I need my space, but her space and my space are practically the same space. Froeger said she has started to think she needs someone who will "be there for me occasionally. "The next person I date should live in, say, Chicago or Minneapolis," Froeger said. "There are a lot of nice guys from the Midwest profiled on those Internet dating sites. If I was seeing someone farther away, we could spend a passionate weekend together, but I wouldn't have to sit around at Starbucks for an extra two hours after work until I'm certain I won't run into him. Petrakis said he agrees that a break-up might be the only answer. "Next time I'm on the market, I'm gonna get out to a lot of out-of-the-way bars in neighborhoods that I wouldn't normally have any reason to be in, like that area behind the expo center," Petrakis said. "From now on, I'm going to stick with the 50-block rule: no dating anyone who doesn't live at least a 10-minute car ride away.

Local Chapter Of Rosie's Chub Club Soldiers On
WILMINGTON, DE — It was time for another weekly weigh-in for the four remaining members of the Wilmington chapter of Rosie's Chub Club Monday. Although there was some debate about the accuracy of host Pat Chowen's battered bathroom scale, the results were still distressing: a cumulative gain of 11 pounds from last week. Karen Daemisch, the group's president and "den mother," remained upbeat. "Don't despair, ladies! " Daemisch said. "We're just coming off the holidays. But now that the goodies are gone, Rosie would want us to get back on track. Well… that is, if Rosie still ran the Chub Club. Or did her talk show. Or still talked to her fans. Daemisch was referring to Rosie O'Donnell, whose talk show topped daytime-TV ratings in the late '90s. Unveiled in 1999, Rosie's Chub Club encouraged overweight viewers to make gradual lifestyle changes and adhere to the motto, "Eat less and move more. " As a part of her commitment to the program, O'Donnell would relate her own ongoing struggles with weight loss on air and reassure viewers that they were not alone in their dieting battles. She also motivated Chub Club members by listing successful dieters in the "Top 10 Losers" section of her web site, and by making regular entries in her "Chub Club Journal." But when O'Donnell left NBC in 2002, the Chub Club went with her. Believed to be the last Chub Club in existence, the Wilmington chapter soldiers on. Its remaining members still meet weekly, and still gamely attempt to reach their stated weight-loss goals. Following the disappointing weigh-in, Daemisch tried to shore up morale by giving out the Koosh Prize For Excellence In Willpower. This week's honor went to member Bobbette Hines for drinking eight glasses of water a day. "A big Rosie Rah-Rah to you, Bobbette," Daemisch said. "Even though that's a lot to drink, water fills up your stomach real good, and it keeps you from eating. And Bobbette was the only one of us who gained less than two pounds. Hines declined the award, admitting that she substituted Snapples for several of her glasses of water. According to Daemisch, keeping her Chub Clubbers motivated is difficult, not only because of the ongoing challenge of losing weight, but also because O'Donnell has virtually disappeared from the public eye. Other than filing a lawsuit against the publishers of Rosie magazine and producing a Broadway musical based on the life of Boy George, she has kept a low profile. "We were all huge fans of Rosie, so when she ditched her show, a lot of the ladies did feel a bit abandoned," Daemisch said. At its 2000 peak, the Wilmington club boasted 28 members. Since the show went off the air, however, membership has steadily dwindled to its current low of four. To keep themselves motivated, Chub Clubbers view old VHS tapes of O'Donnell's show, read printed-out screen captures from her talk show's defunct web site, and mark their weight on a colorful chart featuring O'Donnell's face. Members also play the confidence-boosting games described in the official Chub Club handbook. "This is a real fun one," Daemisch said, pointing to a wall covered with broad sheets of white paper on which crude outlines of the quartet's stocky figures were traced. "We take our Koosh slingshots and aim at the areas where we want to lose weight the most. The book says it helps us work off aggression as we strive to meet our weight-loss goals. Next, the group played "What Would Rosie Do?," a game in which players contemplate what O'Donnell would do if presented with various dieting dilemmas. Asked what Rosie would do if she were offered a Krispy Kreme doughnut after eating a full dinner, Chub Clubber Michele Glass said, "I think she'd accept the doughnut and eat a bite of it, but save the rest for a snack tomorrow. "No," Chowen said. "She'd give it to a food pantry, because she's so generous. Rising from the floor as quickly as her girth would allow, a visibly agitated Hines disagreed with both assessments. "Rosie's just as fat as she was when she had her talk show," Hines said. "In fact, she's fatter. So I think if you gave Rosie a Krispy Kreme doughnut right after she ate a full dinner, she'd probably eat the doughnut, have another, then get an ugly retro-'80s haircut, do some unfunny standup, and leave in the middle of her set, because she's a quitter and a lazy cow! Hines then grabbed her coat and headed for the door, pausing to hurl her Koosh slingshot at O'Donnell's image on the chart. In spite of losing Hines, Daemisch remains hopeful. She said she's determined to see her weight-loss mission to its end, and equally committed to keeping O'Donnell's presence alive in the Chub Club. "Rosie's the reason for the Chub Club," Daemisch said. "Why would I eliminate all traces of her? That'd turn us into a plain old weight-loss support group. How boring! Added Daemisch: "Our club has lost more than 50 pounds in five years. But it's not strictly about dropping a dress size. The club is about feeling good about yourself and very, very slowly integrating diet and exercise routines into your life. Rosie would have wanted it that way. I mean, she does want it that way.

Your Dog Is In Heaven Now, With No One To Feed Him
Come over here and sit on Mommy's lap. I've got some bad news, Tommy. Are you ready? Tommy, while you were at school today, Sparky got out of the backyard and ran in front of a truck. I rushed him to the vet, but there was nothing she could do. I'm so sorry, honey. I know that you loved Sparky very much, but I'm afraid he's gone to Doggie Heaven. Remember learning about Heaven in Sunday school? Doggie Heaven is like that, but there are no people there, because it's a place for dogs to spend forever, romping and playing with other dogs. Hmm, that's a good question, honey. I don't know who's going to feed Sparky. I guess no one. Don't cry, Tommy. You shouldn't be sad. Doggie Heaven is a wonderful place where all the dogs nap in the sun on big cloud mattresses all day. And every dog has his own big food bowl with his name engraved on it. But I suppose you're right: Sparky's bowl will be empty, because you won't be there to fill it. Eventually, he'll probably get so hungry he'll try gnawing off his own tail, just to do something to try to stop the pain in his belly. Doggie Heaven has big, green fields for romping, and Sparky can chase all the rabbits and squirrels he wants. Everywhere you look, there are all kinds of rubber toys. But he'll probably be so hungry that he'll tear the rubber toys apart and eat them. Then he'll throw up, just like the time he ate the potpourri. I imagine he'll try to eat his own vomit, and then the angels up there will smack him with a rolled-up newspaper for being a bad dog. Of course Doggie Heaven has angels! They're God's special friends. The angels play harps for the dogs and make sure they don't jump the fence into cat heaven. Do you remember when Grandma died, and we told you about St. Peter? He's the one who knows who's been good and who's been bad, just like Santa. But instead of presents, St. Peter lets people into Heaven. That's a nice idea, honey, but he's much too busy to feed little boys' dogs. Why don't the angels feed Sparky? Because he's your dog. Remember how you begged us to get him from the pet store, and we didn't think you were ready for the responsibility? Remember how you prayed that you'd be able to get Sparky and promised that if we brought him home, you'd be the one to feed and walk him every single day? Well, Tommy, you made a promise, and God will hold you to it, no matter how much Sparky howls and whimpers. I wouldn't be surprised if God chains Sparky outside until he learns how to be quiet, which might be a long time. You remember how spunky Sparky was. That was part of the reason that we loved him, wasn't it? Sparky had character, but God likes obedience. He won't take kindly to a dog with an attitude. Of course Sparky is going to miss you! He was your best friend, and he's up there right now with a ball in his mouth, waiting for you to play catch with him. When you go to Heaven and are an angel yourself, you'll be able to visit him and play with him all you like, unless he's gone crazy from malnutrition and tries to eat your face off when he sees you. Well, that is, if he still has eyes. He may have already clawed them out in hunger. But you can't feed Sparky from here. You're still alive and Sparky is an angel dog. You can fill up his bowl down here all you want, but he's up there and can't get to it. The delicious smell of Ken-L Ration wafting up to Heaven won't do anything but make Sparky hungrier. No, Sparky won't be able to die. He's in heaven, you silly-billy. You can't die in Heaven. Even if Sparky asks another dog whom he trusts to tear his throat open, or deliberately twists his neck between the bars on the pearly gates, or chokes down some sticks in an attempt to puncture his aching tummy, he still won't be able to die. Sparky will just keep on living forever, wondering why you aren't feeding him. That's how Heaven is. Mary Othmar

Mom Hogging Family Therapy Session
THORNTON, CO — According to her husband and two children, Jeanette Westphal, 41, is hogging the regular therapy sessions supposedly intended to help all of them. "Mom made us go to stupid therapy, because she said we had to learn to communicate as a family," 12-year-old daughter Amy said of the sessions the family has been attending since March. "Now, every Tuesday from 6 to 7 p.m., we sit in a circle and listen to Mom talk. It's driving everyone crazy, but try telling her that. She won't hear you, because she's too busy going on about her boring 'needs.' Hello, there are other people in therapy here. Westphal's husband Greg said he can't get a word in edgewise, either. "We never would've gone to see Dr. [Whitney] Eversen if Jeanette hadn't nagged me about how we need to talk through our problems," Greg said. "As I see it, our biggest problem is that she won't shut up about her feelings and let somebody else have a turn. She acts like it's her own private radio show. Although Westphal usually mediates conflicts between family members, and is described as the individual who most frequently calls for calm and quiet in the home, she exhibits a different side of herself in therapy. Thomas, 16, said that, once his mother is the center of attention, "she becomes a total drama queen. "It's pretty scary, man," Thomas said. "Who knew Mom could freak out so bad? None of us, that's for sure. We were all, like, where is this coming from? I don't even remember any St. Patrick's Day cookies. I never knew she was such a glutton for attention. Thomas added: "Thanks to family therapy, we've learned a lot about Mom's thoughts and feelings. She's a total psycho. Family members report that, in the past several sessions, Westphal has complained that Thomas always sides with Greg, expressed her resentment over the amount of housework she does, and repeatedly returned to the fact that, in 17 years of marriage, Greg has never purchased her a gift without first asking her what she would like, in spite of the fact that she has repeatedly told him that she loves surprises and would never be disappointed with anything he bought, as long as it came from the heart. "It's like, 'Hey, Mom, give it a rest, okay?' " Thomas said. "Not that you could ever say that in a session. She'd just start flipping out about how nobody listens to her and how she's invisible and stuff. Or how some saleslady at Sears looked right through her as if she didn't exist. Next thing you know, the session's over. Eversen said reining the attention-starved mother and wife in has been challenging. "During the very first session, I always inform the family members that there are no right or wrong things to say in therapy," Eversen said, pausing to take two Advil tablets with a glass of water. "That really opened the floodgates for Jeanette. Now, she feels she can say anything she wants, at any length she wants. I've stressed the importance of listening, but I think she's taken that to mean that the others should listen to her. "Clearly, this woman has major issues that she needs to express, but she's not listened to in other settings," Eversen added. "The session is her one moment in the sun each week. Eversen said that, in the last session, he attempted to moderate equal time for each family member by having everyone use hand puppets as communication tools. "Somehow, Jeanette got all four puppets and, using a different voice for each one, launched into an epic diatribe about how she is forced to be wife, mother, maid, and… well, I forget the last one," Eversen said. "I had to finally interrupt her and politely remind her that we were trying to do a group exercise. After the "puppet incident," Eversen said he pulled Westphal aside and recommended that she come in for individual sessions. "She was resistant," Eversen said. "She said the whole point of the therapy was to work out family issues, together, as a family. I'm not sure what to do. Frankly, I'm afraid this may be beyond my training. In spite of the obstacles, the family has no immediate plans to discontinue therapy. "For 20 years, my wife has walked through life with a smile on her face, calmly and generously giving of herself whenever she's needed," Greg said. "Now, we're expected to listen to everything from the darkest recesses of her subconscious all at once? "What about my needs? " Greg added. "I have been waiting 12 sessions to discuss my self-esteem concerns over my receding hairline. By the time I get around to expressing that to my kids, Thomas is going to be going bald himself.

Man Stays Up All Night Procrastinating
FLAGSTAFF, AZ — Ba;nk manager Ron Bogen, 29, worked into the wee hours of the morning not writing his speech for the semi-annual Compass Bank Best Practices Conference Tuesday. "If I'm a bit slow today, it's because I was up all night working on that presentation," Bogen told his coworkers over lunch Tuesday. "It was a lot slower going than I thought it would be, and a bunch of other stuff came up while I was working on it. All in all, it took me, like, 10 hours. According to live-in girlfriend Sophie Collins, the evening started well for Bogen. "Ron talked all weekend about needing to write his speech, but he finally sat down at about 8 Monday night," Collins said. "He had everything he needed laid out on the table: all of the papers and brochures from work, his pens and highlighters, and a tape recorder. In less than half an hour, he was cleaning the bathroom. Bogen explained: "I was in the bathroom thinking through the opening of the speech when I saw how disgusting the sink was. I couldn't concentrate with a sink that filthy under me. It was no big deal, though — a; little Comet, a thorough scrubbing, and a rinse. Took 20 minutes, tops. After cleaning the sink, picking his dirty clothes up off the floor, and hanging new towels on the rack, Bogen said he realized that he hadn't spoken to his parents in at least two weeks. After he called his parents, he then called his brother, and then his sister. "I wanted to get down to work, but I couldn't just call everyone but Tammy," Bogen said. At 10 p.m., Bogen returned to his desk to begin his speech. When he booted up his Dell Inspiron, a dialog box appeared, urging him to install a new Windows XP security patch. "I'd been ignoring that warning for months," Bogen said. "I said to myself, 'Let's just get it done.' After installing and rebooting, Bogen decided to update his Flash Player and Internet Explorer plug-ins, as well. At 10:45 p.m., Bogen began to organize his speech by writing it out in longhand on index cards. While looking for index cards, he noticed a pile of bills. "I'd been meaning to switch over to paperless billing for my cable and phone and everything for months," Bogen said. "It felt so good to finally have that all set up. Bogen was ready to tackle his presentation once again at 11:15 p.m. "I was getting back down to work when I remembered that there was a great speech in that movie Sneakers," Bogen said. "I knew it would be really helpful for my own speech, so I got out the DVD. I ended up watching the whole movie before I realized that the speech was actually in Dave. But I didn't watch that movie, because it was 1 a.m., and I really needed to get cracking. That is, right after I organized my DVD shelf, which had gotten really out of control. Between the hours of 1 and 2:30 a.m., Bogen searched the Internet for information about his old high-school friends, read the latest Time magazine from cover to cover, bought three books on Amazon, and downloaded a single from Jay-Z's Black Album. Bogen also showered and shaved "to get into the perfect condition to do some writing. "I don't know why a shower helps, but it does," Bogen said. "As soon as I finished eating the fajitas I made, my mind was on nothing but the speech. Collins, who urged Bogen to finish his speech so he could go to bed with her, was disappointed to wake up alone. "I found Ron with his head down on his keyboard, a blank Word document on his screen, and note cards with jokes written on them strewn everywhere," Collins said. "Clearly, he'd gone to some Internet site devoted to funny ice-breakers and spent hours writing down his favorites. As the couple got ready for work, Bogen furiously scribbled an outline for his presentation on a notepad as he brushed his teeth and dressed. Bogen said he promised himself that he wouldn't tell anyone how long he worked on the speech, but he broke his promise as soon as he slid in beside coworker and carpool member Will Serber. "Ron said he looked like shit because he was up all night slaving away on work for the conference," Serber said. "But, from what I could tell, he wrote as many pages of his speech during the 20-minute ride to work as he'd written the whole night before. Bogen, who has been branch manager of Flagstaff's Central Avenue Compass Bank for nearly 11 months, delivered his eight-minute speech Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. without major incident. "The speech turned out pretty good," Bogen said. "Just goes to show that it pays to put in the effort and pull an all-nighter." Although the speech was well received, one audience member noted that Bogen looked "bedraggled." "They must be working Ron really hard over at Central," said Seth Friedlander, who worked with Bogen at his old branch. "He looked like he'd been burning the midnight oil. That's why I'm not management material. I need a full night's sleep, or I can't get anything done the next day.

Good Cop, Bad Cop Both Racist
LOS ANGELES — Despite occupying opposing roles in a good-cop/bad-cop dyad, LAPD officers Frank K. McGrew, 51, and Bob West, 36, have one thing in common: They're both extremely racist, 77th precinct sources reported Monday. "Officer McGrew is the tough, no-nonsense veteran of the force who pushes you around, threatens you with 15 years behind bars, and calls you a nigger," said LeShawn Gordon, a 19-year-old recently charged with grand theft auto. "Officer Bob is the one who picks you up, gives you a cigarette, and tells you he's there to help you before calling you a nigger. West and McGrew have been partners on the station's investigative unit since August 2001, but both have been racists for much longer. The team, assigned to a particularly crime-ridden two-mile section of South Central, uses a law-enforcement technique common among police partners. "Bad cop" McGrew attempts to draw information or a confession out of perpetrators by frightening them, while "good cop" West does so by gaining their trust. But detainees who've been interrogated by the pair say the two share a hatred for non-whites that transcends their contrasting styles. Jaime Hernandez, 24, was interrogated by McGrew and West after he was arrested on Feb. 18 for trafficking in narcotics. "McGrew cuffed me to a desk, clubbed me in the face with a broom handle, and screamed that my 'spic' buddies on the street couldn't help me now," Hernandez said. "He let me sit there for an hour. Then West came in and removed the handcuffs. He got me a Pepsi and some Twinkies, and while I ate them, he explained, in a caring and sensitive way, why I really ought to cooperate. He said he'd do everything he could do to help me, but that I had to face the fact that I was a no-good taco bender from the barrio with five chicken-babies, two priors, and only one real option: to talk. Their mutual disdain for minorities aside, the two racist partners couldn't be more different, fellow officers report. "McGrew is a barrel-chested bruiser with the same close-cropped crewcut he's had since his cadet days. He's twice-divorced, spends his nights at a local tavern, and is rumored to have an unending series of problematic short-term relationships with white women half his age," LAPD officer Terry Steig said. "West, however, is a smiling, kind-eyed listener who enjoys spending weekends in the park and is fiercely devoted to his white wife and their white infant child. Many officers say bigotry and hatred are the ties that bind the two. "When the chief first put those two together, the sparks really flew," fellow LAPD officer Duane Garner said. "It was your classic mismatched-partners situation. McGrew was a grizzled veteran who'd developed a cynical attitude toward minorities after years of witnessing ugly street crime firsthand. West, on the other hand, was an idealistic young golden boy from the academy who took the horror stories his teachers told about the scum of the earth to heart. They were like oil and water, but they learned to respect each other's approaches to shaking confessions out of slants, cholos, and homeboys. Leaning against the sink in the station's cramped and dirty kitchenette, the two men expressed admiration for each other. "Sometimes Frank goes too far, but I know his heart is in the right place," West said. "He just wants to make a difference by protecting and serving good, hard-working white people. "Sometimes West can be a mollycoddling nanny, but he's still a good cop," McGrew said in response. "In his own way, he's doing what he thinks he has to do to control these stinking, subhuman mud-people." Added McGrew: "Sure, sometimes he drives me crazy. I can be one good crack away from getting some beaner to confess, and he'll break in with his namby-pamby wah-wah, saying he can promise a better life for the 10 dirty little kids the guy must have running around at home. But in the end, we always get the job done. It just goes to show that no matter how different we are, we're both doing what we need to do to get these animals behind bars, where they belong.

Baby Boring
TAMARAC, FL — Michelle, the three-week-old daughter of area residents Sue and Allen McKay, is "unbelievably boring," sources close to the couple said Monday. "Sue's always raving about how amazing Michelle is," friend Elena Jacobs said. "But then you meet her, and she barely moves. Who knows? Maybe Michelle is an incredibly charming and engaging little mastermind during the 20 minutes each day that she's awake and not crying. " Jacobs added that Michelle must have been born with her mother's eyes and her father's total lack of personality.

Enraged Man Unable To Break TV
SHREVEPORT, LA — Enraged after seeing his ex-wife in a local commercial, area resident Bill Schwartz, 48, threw a potentially destructive tantrum Monday, but was unable to smash the screen of his 42-inch high-definition television. "If that television were less durable, there would be no doubt as to just how upset I am right now," Schwartz said after launching two shoes and a telephone at the screen. "Damn it. " Schwartz then made a final charge at the television before collapsing dejectedly into a recliner.

Small Town Honors Once-Ostracized Artist
ANSLEY, NE — Nearly 450 of Ansley's 590 residents gathered in the town square Monday morning to dedicate a statue of the late sculptor Robert Kett, who was born in the town in 1946 and generally either ignored or reviled during the 24 years he lived there. "Although no one took any notice of his art while he lived here, Mr. Kett has touched us all through his national fame," said Ansley mayor Paul Hollub, who went to high school with Kett and frequently referred to him as "that Kett faggot. " "Though he was the object of our derision for many years, Robert is truly Ansley's favorite son. " Examples of Kett's work, on display at the Guggenheim, will be reproduced and sold in postcard form at the ice-cream shop behind which he was once beaten up.

Woman Mentally Breaks Up With Colin Farrell
MERCER, PA — Heather Lentz's 11-month imaginary romance with bad-boy heartthrob Colin Farrell has ended, the 25-year-old paralegal announced Monday. "While I'll always have affection for Colin, the hard truth is that he's not the kind of man I need in my imagination right now," Lentz said, her voice tight with emotion. "It hurts to say this, but it's probably best that we will never actually meet. Though she was initially infatuated with the piercing good looks and Gaelic charm of the Irish-born star of Minority Report and S.W.A.T., Lentz admitted to being "troubled" by Farrell's widely reported penchant for hard drinking, profanity, and womanizing. "Those brown eyes are to die for, and I'll admit that I've always had a weakness for men with stubble," Lentz said. "Nevertheless, I was turned off by Colin's rude behavior. His constant need for attention is really juvenile. Lentz, who gleaned her knowledge of Farrell from various entertainment-news sources, has never sought a real-life relationship with the rising star, and characterized the phenomenon of celebrity stalking as "pathetic." Nevertheless, when pressed, Lentz was able to give a detailed account of the rise and fall of her pretend relationship with Farrell. "In the beginning, Colin could do no wrong," Lentz said. "I was aware of his wild reputation, but I was willing to tolerate it — I even welcomed it — because he was so exciting and alive. He made life unpredictable. Blind love, I guess. Lentz's passion for the actor manifested itself in several ways. If she caught a TV report on Farrell, she would quickly insert a tape into her VCR and record the remainder of the segment. If she saw that Farrell was scheduled as a guest on a late-night talk show, she would stay up to watch the appearance. Lentz would also buy a magazine if Farrell was on the cover, and even attended an opening-day showing of Daredevil, in spite of her aversion to most action movies. "My crush on Colin transformed me," Lentz said. "I found myself standing taller, dressing better, and taking things a little less seriously. My friends noticed the change. Still, all the while, anxiety was creeping in: What if I wasn't the type of woman he would find attractive? Eventually, Lentz said "reality" set in. "Colin and I live in separate worlds, divided by an unbridgeable gulf," Lentz said. "He's a wild, glamorous actor from cosmopolitan Dublin, and I'm just a community-college graduate from western Pennsylvania with a low-paying job and average looks. It would never work. "Colin loves fast living, and I prefer quiet evenings at home," Lentz said. "At first, I would imagine all the fun parties we'd go to if we were dating, but I grew tired of that pretty quickly. I started picturing myself sitting there in my bathrobe, waiting up for him — just like my mom used to do. I don't want that. Lentz also began to wonder if Farrell would remain faithful. "It got to where I couldn't fantasize about us being together without constantly wondering if he would run around on me," Lentz said. "If he's cheated on women before, I couldn't see why I'd be an exception. He's just not worth the heartache. The news that one of Farrell's girlfriends, model Kim Bordenave, gave birth to his son helped convince Lentz to break it off once and for all. "I had to dump him from my thoughts, if only to preserve my sanity," she said. "I know that I'm choosing practicality over love, and maybe that makes me as weak as Colin, but in a different way. Lentz said she is taking steps to scale back Farrell's presence in her life. She has taped over her copies of his Access Hollywood appearances, and removed the film Hart's War, starring Farrell and Bruce Willis, from her Netflix queue. Rumor has it that Lentz was recently overheard commenting on the attractiveness of the Scottish actor Ewan McGregor. Still, although Lentz said she considers McGregor "cute," she denied any pretend relationship. "To tell you the truth, I've been much more attracted to the veneer of maturity and stability lately," Lentz said. "I saw William H. Macy in [the TV movie] Door To Door, and he seemed like a man who could hold a woman's attention. Neither Farrell, on location in Australia, nor Lentz's real-life boyfriend Neil Benson, working late at Mercer Credit Union, could be reached for comment.

Family Unsure What To Do With Dead Hipster's Possessions
LOUISVILLE, KY — Five weeks after the death of her 26-year-old hipster son Kent, Enid Lowery announced that the family faces a difficult task in figuring out what to do with his many unusual possessions. "I just can't believe how much stuff Kent collected over the years," said Lowery Tuesday. "There's a poster for some movie called Urgh!, stacks of empty Quisp cereal boxes, at least five old lamps that don't work, and a slew of little plastic toys. Obviously, all these things meant something to Kent — but what? And why? A part-time English tutor and bassist for the local band Extra Moist, Kent died in a car accident Sept. 27. Overwhelmed with grief, his family members in nearby Bedford only mustered the strength to visit his apartment last week, where they were overwhelmed once again, this time by Kent's dense accumulation of miscellany. Assisted by her husband Thomas and her daughter Regina Panziel, Lowery set to the task of packing up the contents of her son's crowded one-bedroom apartment. "Of course, we'll take some of Kent's things home with us, to remember him by," Lowery said. "But we agreed, as a family, that it's not a good idea to just pack everything up and keep it. Not that we'd have enough room for five boxes of video tapes and three wooden birdcages anyway. Although they were aware that their son had "unusual tastes," the Lowerys said they were surprised by the sheer volume of his collections. Lowery said the large number of items has made it difficult to decide which of her son's former possessions to choose as keepsakes. "I'm so at a loss," Lowery said. "Which of these things best represents Kent? Should I choose the Pachinko machine to place on the mantle at home? Would Patricia [Eisner, Kent's favorite aunt] rather have this Two-Lane Blacktop DVD or this set of tiki lamps? What is a Pachinko machine? The family has considered donating the items that will not be kept as reminders of Kent. "I'd like to give his dishes to Goodwill or the local church, but I'm not sure they would want them," Lowery said. "None of his plates and cups match, and every single coffee mug is different. Here's a Zoloft mug, and here's one from White Castle hamburgers. This one says 'Hands Off Howard's Coffee.' I find it strange that he owned that, considering that he lived alone and never mentioned a friend named Howard." Although Kent's parents lean toward donating his possessions, Kent's 30-year-old sister said she feels that the legacy of his eccentric, old, and cheaply made possessions should be preserved. "Unfortunately, Kent didn't leave a will," Panziel said. "But it's obvious that he put a lot of time and effort into collecting these things. I think we should try to get them to someone who might appreciate them. Maybe there's someone out there who really wants a set of Hello Kitty pillows and an accordion with no straps. Panziel said the family has been largely unable to determine which items might be of value to anyone other than Kent. "See these records? " said Panziel, pointing to a pile of Herb Alpert LPs. "I don't think Grandma even listens to this stuff anymore, but I know that old vinyl can be valuable. If some of these records are worth something, I'm sure Kent would want us to think carefully about where they end up. But is this copy of 'The Super Bowl Shuffle' worth keeping? How about this Amazing Kreskin record? I don't know how to tell. The Lowerys said the logistics of selling all of the items, either to raise money for charity or to cover the funeral expenses, are daunting. "We've been going through his things for days," Lowery said. "Just think how long it would take to try and sell it all. We thought about having an estate sale, but I don't think a collection of Dallas and Mod Squad lunch boxes is the sort of thing anyone would buy. But then again, what do I know? I never would've guessed that Kent used a lunch box, either. The Lowerys have asked friends who collect antiques for guidance. "We called our friend Jack Puller, but he didn't know what to say," Lowery said. "He said there's a market for antique toys and old dishware, but he didn't know the value of any of the specific things I named. He didn't have any advice at all on the plastic cookie jar shaped like a dog that barks when you open its head. And he just coughed when I asked him about the phone shaped like a football. As of press time, the family is considering putting Kent's belongings in storage while they do some research. "I'm hoping someone out there can tell us more about what these things are, and what we should do with them," Thomas Lowery said. "We're just too sad and confused to make the decision right now. One thing's for sure: The furniture is going to the curb. To look at it, you'd think that's where Kent, God rest his soul, got it in the first place.

Deep Down, Woman Knows She's Watching Entire Trading Spaces Marathon
WINNSBORO, LA — On some level, college professor Lynnda Dale, 48, knows she'll watch this Saturday's entire 12-episode Trading Spaces marathon, Dale almost acknowledged Monday. "Hey, I sorta like that stupid show," said Dale, when she spotted the row of listings for the TLC home-makeover series. "I've got a lot to do, so I'll just watch one episode. But on the off chance that I get sucked in, I can do those lesson plans the next day. " Dale said that if she does tune in to the marathon, she won't pay close attention to the show, but will only keep it on for background noise as she does housework.

Mournful Irish Flute Used In Documentary About Loss Of Senior Lounge
GREENWICH, CT — In a documentary that the Greenwich High School Gazette called "daring and evocative," 17-year-old director Brad Harrison used a plaintive Irish-flute melody to underscore what he described as the "tragic nature of the loss of the senior lounge. "It wasn't easy to find the right soundtrack for my film," Harrison said as he smoked a cigarette in the school parking lot. "I knew it needed to be profoundly emotional. Luckily, when I was at Best Buy, I heard this CD called Celtic Moon. The third track, 'Dark In Dublin,' totally sucked me in. Todd Fackler, cinematographer of the 11-minute short, Paradise Lost: The Story Of Room 114, said he approved of the mournful flute music. "This whole movie was shot with tone in mind," Fackler said. "I spent two hours getting the perfect skateboard-dolly shot of the lounge. I wanted the audience to feel that. When Brad had Elton John's 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' in there, it just wasn't doing it. "But that wooden flute is dead on — it's so monumentally sad," Fackler added. "Everyone's been looking forward to using that lounge for the past three years. Harrison said he has looked forward to using the lounge for even longer. "My older brother told me about the lounge when I was in seventh grade," Harrison said. "He told me how each new senior class would decorate it however they wanted, and how you could hang out in there during lunch hour or whenever. That lounge was a tradition. Through the years, students furnished Room 114 with items brought in from home: a couch, two bean-bag chairs, a television, and a rug. But upon returning for the new school year on Sept. 8, Harrison and his classmates found the furniture replaced by stacks of chairs, desks, and various janitorial supplies. Students later found out that Principal Richard Ventzian had cruelly repurposed Room 114, filling it with the contents of Room 232, the former furniture-storage room, now the science laboratory. A single upholstered chair is all that remains of the old lounge. "We didn't even get any say in the matter," Harrison said. "It was so unfair. I couldn't just stand by and watch it happen. Harrison said he began work on Paradise Lost "immediately." The movie took two weeks to shoot and another four days to edit. "I didn't do this just for me, or even for my classmates. I did it for future generations of GHS students," Harrison said. "Homecoming week will never be the same without that lounge. According to the documentary, Ventzian was the one who officially designated the room as a senior lounge in the spring of 1995, when the school district cancelled its drivers-education program. Reached at his office, Ventzian said students were given use of Room 114 with the caveat that the room could be used as a lounge "only until it was needed for other purposes. Grainy pans across Room 114's furniture-stacked west wall feature prominently in Paradise Lost. The documentary also includes testimonials from outraged students and an interview with Ventzian. It's all tied together by the dramatic voiceover narration of Dan Phelan, the senior with the deepest voice. The documentary opens on a black-and-white, slow-motion shot of feet walking down a tiled hallway. "They say people can survive as long as they have hope and water, or see a light at the end of the tunnel," Phelan narrates. "But what happens when that light is snuffed out? Harrison shot several student interviews in his darkened bedroom, with subjects cast in silhouette so that they could speak with impunity. "They're just mad because we toilet-papered the school and egged Ventzian's car last year," an anonymous student said. "That lounge was ours, man. They can't just take it away from us. "But I guess they can and did," added the subject, who was identified on the screen as a National Honor Society member. "It's a bunch of bullcrap. Senior Jennifer Shouse expressed her frustration openly. As student council president, Shouse proposed a resolution to return Room 114 to the seniors. Although the act passed unanimously, it was ignored by GHS staff. "It's a travesty," Shouse said. "They're infringing on our rights. America is all about freedom, and I used to think that GHS was, too. I guess I was wrong. The movie ends with a slow-motion shot of Room 114's door closing. The shot is accompanied by the sound of a prison door slamming shut. After several seconds of blackness, Harrison's cell-phone number appears on screen, alongside a plea for viewers to "get involved. " At this point, the Irish-flute music takes the movie through the credits. Harrison shot his documentary on a Sony Mini-DV camcorder that he received for his 17th birthday. The project received an "A-minus" Tuesday in Harrison's audio-visual art class.

Rise In Teen Sexual Activity Comes As Surprise To Area Teen
SALEM, OR — The Alan Guttmacher Institute released a report Friday that showed a dramatic increase in teen sexual activity, a finding that surprised policy-makers, public-health professionals, and 17-year-old Tom Ellis. "So, more teens are having sex, are they? " Ellis asked Monday. "Well, I'm not sure where those guys got all their data, but it sure wasn't from me. Ellis, a senior this fall at Sprague High School in Salem, learned of the trend while watching television at home Saturday, as he does most weekend nights. A 20/20 story titled "The Teen Sex Epidemic" informed him that 82.6 percent of his peers aged 15 to 19 have engaged in some form of sexual contact with another person. "Really?" Ellis asked. "Eight out of 10 teens? There's an epidemic? While excited by the findings on teen sexuality, Ellis has yet to observe the increase in his own life. "I mean, it's summer, and I can't help but notice all the girls wearing sexy dresses and tank tops and stuff," he said. "But, does that mean I'm one millimeter closer to getting some tail? No, sir. "Doesn't matter that I've grown six inches this year, that I've been working out in my basement, or that I dress in Gap clothes, like everyone else," Ellis continued. "Girls like Kelly [Mehan] and Michelle [Lehrer] still totally ignore me. At this rate, I'll be lucky to French [kiss] a girl before college. Although teen sexual activity is on the rise, the Guttmacher report indicated that the teen pregnancy rate has dropped to a 13-year low. "More teens are engaging in sex, but a larger percentage of them are doing so responsibly," said Dr. Jerry Kendall, a senior researcher for the Guttmacher Institute. "There's an increased access to and acceptance of proper contraceptives, mainly the condom, even among the disenfranchised teen population. An additional factor is the marked casualization of oral sex, which is often substituted for full intercourse. "Really?!" Ellis asked. "Blow jobs? Well, that national trend hasn't spread to Salem yet, because I'm about one blow job shy of joining that statistic. It would take a miracle to get a girl to go down on me. Ellis did confirm that he would use a condom if he were to have sex. "You have sex, you wear a condom," said Ellis, who has practiced proper condom use alone in his bedroom. "At least that's what everybody says. I certainly wouldn't know from experience because, clearly, I'm a freak. I'm one of the pathetic 18 percent who still haven't even seen, much less touched, a naked breast. Well, rest assured: When and if I ever get the chance to have sex, I will definitely know how to put on a condom. Although Ellis has carefully documented his intense desire for a sexual encounter in his journal, that desire hasn't translated into sexual activity. Ellis insisted that this is not by choice. "Hey, I'm not one of those weird abstinence kids," Ellis said. "There's nothing I would like better than to waste myself on the wrong girl. I just want to know: Where in the hell are all these millions of loose teenage girls? Because they certainly don't go to my school. According to friend Doug Binder, Ellis' chances of joining the growing ranks of the sexually experienced are slim. "Tom?" Binder asked. "He's doomed to virginity, just like me. But, hey, that doesn't stop us from talking and thinking about sex all the freaking time. For all our yapping about what we'd do if we were ever alone with a girl, neither of us is anywhere near getting some action. Although he admitted he was startled by the report, Ellis said he remains hopeful for the future. "I've still got two years to get laid and join the majority," Ellis said. "I mean, I've heard guys talking about all the girls they've slept with, but I thought they were just making it up. Turns out, everyone really was having sex all that time. Well, thanks, 20/20. Now I know what a complete loser I am.

Woman Mentions Participation In Cancer Walk To Cancer Patient
DENVER — Trying to show empathy, Marilyn Rossum, 42, informed coworker and recently diagnosed breast-cancer patient Georgia Anderson, 40, that she participated in a breast-cancer walk-a-thon in 2001. "Oh, Georgia, I'm so sorry," Rossum told Anderson upon hearing the news Monday. "A few years back, I did the Avon Walk For Breast Cancer, and there were so many brave women like you who were afflicted or survivors, and it was just so moving. " Rossum added that her efforts raised nearly $80 for breast-cancer research.

Lottery Winner An Inspiration To All Who Play The Lottery
SNELLVILLE, GA–After years of back-breaking ticket-buying, Teddy LeBarge's hard work finally paid off Monday, when the 36-year-old Snellville man won $193 million in the multi-state Mega Millions lottery, making him an inspiration to lottery players everywhere. "I'm not going to be afraid to take risks anymore," said Teri Oswalt, a Paducah, KY, homemaker and one of the millions of Americans moved by LeBarge's remarkable rags-to-riches story. "I'm going to remember what Teddy LeBarge said: 'I just picked my numbers, and they finally done come up a winner.' If he can do it, so can I." "This man didn't just hit the jackpot the first time he ever bought a ticket," said Carla Brooke of Batavia, NY. "He'd been going down to that gas station for years. It just goes to show you that there's no such thing as an overnight success. The son of two factory workers, LeBarge grew up without the educational and economic opportunities most Americans take for granted. But that didn't stop him from striving to make something of himself. "Yeah, I'd drive my old heap of junk down to the Amoco station near every Friday–Friday bein' payday–buy myself a carton of cigarettes, six-pack of Busch, and a few lottery tickets," LeBarge said. "Some days during the week, I'd get me some scratch-offs, too, but I always made sure to buy that MegaPick ticket, 'cause that's where you get the big money. Despite going years without winning a single lottery jackpot, an undaunted LeBarge bravely soldiered on. "There was sometimes I thought I wasn't ever going to win, but I kept going," LeBarge said. "I knew I had to if I ever wanted a big TV and a boat and a Humvee and things like that. "I didn't let [not winning] get me down, 'cause I knew what I wanted," LeBarge continued. "Sometimes, it wasn't easy to scrounge up those couple dollars, like when I was unemployed from '92 to '95, but I did it. And here I am today–a goddamn millionaire. Shit." LeBarge, who will receive his jackpot in annual installments of $8.4 million over the next 23 years, quit his job as an unemployment-check collector hours after finding out he was a winner. "[LeBarge] was just a regular guy like me," said James Hale of Carthage, TN. "You don't need to be some fancy lawyer or doctor to win the lottery. You just need to be able to guess the same numbers as the ones that get picked a few days later. LeBarge's tenacity has even inspired some who have never played the lottery before. "I thought the lottery was for other people," said Ralph Fischer, a Medford, OR, retiree. "Now I realize that if I want a check for millions of dollars, I have to get out there and do what it takes. I'm going to make my dreams come true. As for LeBarge's dreams, he said his plans include paying off his many debts, taking a vacation to "someplace exotic," and doing some serious partying. "The world can't help but look up to him," said Brenda Kenyon, a Brookfield, WI, daycare worker who buys about 20 scratch-off lottery tickets a week. "It's so wonderful what he did, such a beautiful story. He truly is a lottery winner. "I see a lot of myself in Teddy LeBarge," Kenyon added. "He's someone who wanted to have a lot of money with little to no effort. And I do, too. More than anything else in the world.

World-Weary Garbage Man No Longer Shocked By Things People Throw Out
TULSA, OK — After years of being appalled by the perfectly good items discarded by Tulsa residents, garbage collector Matt Ciszek, 34, reported Monday that he is "no longer shocked by anything. "Used to be, I'd come across a new breadmaker still in the box, and I'd be floored that someone could be so wasteful," Ciszek told reporters Tuesday. "Now, I don't even flinch. I guess I'm just old. Ciszek, who has worked for the Tulsa Department of Sanitation for nine years, said he has "seen it all in my time. "You wouldn't believe the things I've hauled off," Ciszek said. "Fully functional air conditioners, entire record collections, VCRs, unopened boxes of cereal and canned goods, like-new chairs, desks with barely a scratch, stereo components, computers — you name it. I don't know how many pairs of shoes still in the box, never been worn, I've tossed in the back of the truck. I must have junked 50 miles of extension cords, and I'm guessing 95 percent of those still worked. "Yes, in the beginning, I was stunned," said Ciszek, staring off into the distance. "But now, well, I'm numb to it. It's all just another load to toss in the back. According to his wife, in the early days, Ciszek would come home fuming about the waste he witnessed on his run. "Matt used to get so worked up," said Joan Ciszek, 34. "He'd say, 'You won't believe what I found today — an entire box of tools, with an electric drill and everything. Must've been at least $800 worth of stuff.' Nowadays, he doesn't even talk about work. Even though the Department of Sanitation prohibits garbage collectors from taking discarded items for themselves, Ciszek said he used to pocket the occasional item. "How could I not bend the rules a little? " Ciszek said. "It would've been a sin to let that 20-gallon aquarium tank go to the dump. Years later, however, Ciszek rarely bothers bringing items home. "There's still great stuff out there," Ciszek said. "I guess I just don't have the motivation to do it anymore. I've become jaded. If some guy is going to throw away an entire box of plastic hangers, only to buy a whole new batch of hangers as soon as he moves into his new place, who am I to stop him? I'm just one garbage man.

Harsh Light Of Morning Falls On One-Night Stand's DVD Collection
MILWAUKEE, WI–The harsh light of morning fell on the terrible DVD collection of Marc Koenig Monday, when Traci Pearle discovered it upon waking up from their one-night stand. "It was a wild night, and from what I can recall, I had a great time with Marc," said Pearle, 25. "But I wonder if I would've felt the same way had I known the guy is the proud owner of Rollerball." Pearle, a Marquette University graduate student, and Koenig, a graphic designer, met Sunday during a party at the home of a mutual friend. Pearle and Koenig hit it off almost immediately, thanks largely to their mutual drunkenness. After a lengthy make-out session in a back room, the two departed for Koenig's nearby one-bedroom apartment, where they spent the night. Her powers of observation impaired by alcohol and darkness, Pearle took little notice of Koenig's furnishings. It was not until 8 a.m. that the hung-over Pearle, en route to the bathroom, came across Koenig's disturbingly random, mediocrity-filled DVD collection. "The glare from the living-room window made my eyes smart," Pearle said. "I rubbed them, and the first thing I saw was Narrow Margin sitting on Marc's sunlit coffee table. A nearby DVD shelf revealed similarly banal choices, including Driven, Evolution, Swordfish, Tomcats, Point Break, Pushing Tin, Bedazzled, Flatliners, My Blue Heaven, and Proof Of Life. While acknowledging that the majority of Koenig's movies were "not out-and-out horrible," Pearle wondered why anyone would own those particular titles. "They're the sort of things you'd rent, not buy, if you watch them at all," Pearle said. "Out of the thousands of movies you could own, why would you spend your money on this stuff? Don't you buy a movie because you're somehow passionate about it and want to watch it again and again? Does this guy feel that way about Hard Rain?" In spite of a wicked hangover, Pearle could not resist hypothesizing about Koenig based on his DVD choices. "It struck me as weird that the same person would possess both Hellraiser 2 and Holy Man," Pearle said. "What did it mean? That he's a guy with eclectic tastes, and therefore tolerant and open-minded? Or is he just meek and wishy-washy, surrendering his tastes and imagination to arbitrary pop-culture dictates? He seemed like such a smart, cool guy. Continued Pearle: "I slept with a guy who, at some point in his life, walked into a store and said to the cashier, 'Hi, I would like to purchase this copy of The Legend Of Bagger Vance.'" Pearle admitted that her decision to leave Koenig's apartment around 8:20 a.m. was heavily influenced by the discovery of the DVD collection. "As I got dressed, Marc sat up in bed and took my hand, telling me he had the day off from work if I wanted to stay in with him," Pearle said. "I considered it, but then I noticed the Vince Vaughn version of Psycho on the nightstand, so I made up something about having to meet my professor in half an hour. Therapist and counselor Dr. Patricia Abel said the one-night stand did not come to a particularly unusual end. "Often, casual sexual encounters between two people are not repeated because one of the parties has judged the other based on his or her personal effects," Abel said. "There exists a societal stigma against so-called 'one-night stands,' so Traci may have been subconsciously associating latent feelings of guilt and unfulfillment with Marc's ownership of several Ashley Judd thrillers. Pearle herself has been the victim of possessions-based judgment following a one-night stand. On June 4, 2000, pizza-delivery driver James Gaines fled Pearle's apartment shortly after 6 a.m. when the morning light revealed a Toad The Wet Sprocket CD and a prescription bottle of Xanax.

World-Weary Garbage Man No Longer Shocked By Things People Throw Out
TULSA, OK — After years of being appalled by the perfectly good items discarded by Tulsa residents, garbage collector Matt Ciszek, 34, reported Monday that he is "no longer shocked by anything. "Used to be, I'd come across a new breadmaker still in the box, and I'd be floored that someone could be so wasteful," Ciszek told reporters Tuesday. "Now, I don't even flinch. I guess I'm just old. Ciszek, who has worked for the Tulsa Department of Sanitation for nine years, said he has "seen it all in my time. "You wouldn't believe the things I've hauled off," Ciszek said. "Fully functional air conditioners, entire record collections, VCRs, unopened boxes of cereal and canned goods, like-new chairs, desks with barely a scratch, stereo components, computers — you name it. I don't know how many pairs of shoes still in the box, never been worn, I've tossed in the back of the truck. I must have junked 50 miles of extension cords, and I'm guessing 95 percent of those still worked. "Yes, in the beginning, I was stunned," said Ciszek, staring off into the distance. "But now, well, I'm numb to it. It's all just another load to toss in the back. According to his wife, in the early days, Ciszek would come home fuming about the waste he witnessed on his run. "Matt used to get so worked up," said Joan Ciszek, 34. "He'd say, 'You won't believe what I found today — an entire box of tools, with an electric drill and everything. Must've been at least $800 worth of stuff.' Nowadays, he doesn't even talk about work. Even though the Department of Sanitation prohibits garbage collectors from taking discarded items for themselves, Ciszek said he used to pocket the occasional item. "How could I not bend the rules a little? " Ciszek said. "It would've been a sin to let that 20-gallon aquarium tank go to the dump. Years later, however, Ciszek rarely bothers bringing items home. "There's still great stuff out there," Ciszek said. "I guess I just don't have the motivation to do it anymore. I've become jaded. If some guy is going to throw away an entire box of plastic hangers, only to buy a whole new batch of hangers as soon as he moves into his new place, who am I to stop him? I'm just one garbage man. Ciszek estimated that it was about five years ago that he "stopped noticing. "My job is to get the trash from people's homes to the dump," Ciszek said. "I can't get my job done if I'm always keeping one eye out for the good stuff. Besides, it's too painful to see a perfectly good set of wheel covers crushed right in front of my eyes. As the years roll by, the waste is only getting worse, Ciszek said. "Things I used to see only occasionally have now become the norm," he said.

Before He Knows What's Happening, Man Belongs To $uper $aver's Club
ALTOONA, PA — Will Zimmerman stepped into a local supermarket Monday to purchase a pint of half-and-half, but before he could fully comprehend the situation, the 28-year-old repairman was a member of the Feltz Foods $uper $aver's Club. "Yeah, I've got the card right here in my wallet," said a pale and dazed Zimmerman as he revealed the 3"x2" laminated induction into the $uper $aver family. "I guess I'm supposed to present it at any Feltz Supermarket for super savings. Zimmerman, addressing a sudden shortage of creamer in the Altoona Advance Heating & Cooling breakroom, drove to the Highmarket Road Feltz and at 2:26 p.m. selected a pint of half-and-half from the dairy case without incident. He approached one of the checkout aisles at 2:28 p.m. "I took out my wallet, and the girl at the register asked if I had a $uper $aver's card," Zimmerman said. "She must have interpreted my pause as a 'no,' because she started telling me all this stuff about the $uper $aver's Club." The cashier, 22-year-old Dorothy Salgado, recited a standard description of the benefits of joining the $uper $aver's Club. "Besides being able to take advantage of bigger discounts than non-cardholders, you can receive advance information on monthly specials, free check-cashing privileges, and the ability to participate in Double Coupon Tuesdays," Salgado said she told Zimmerman. "Best of all, there's no cost to join. Zimmerman can recall neither agreeing nor disagreeing to join. "I heard 'discounts' and 'no cost to join,'" he said. "Then it gets fuzzy. The only thing I remember is the girl shoving a form and ballpoint pen in my hand and directing me away from her register. A surveillance tape released by Feltz Foods confirms Zimmerman's recollection. At 2:30 p.m., he is seen leaving the checkout aisle and approaching the service desk. "I didn't really want to fill out a long form because I had to get back to work, but the lady [Feltz Foods supervisor Joyce Epps] said it would just take a couple minutes and it was worth the time," Zimmerman said. Zimmerman described the subsequent events as a "whirlwind of signing and laminating. " "I recall being told to fill out my address and phone number, and to 'press down hard,'" Zimmerman said. "Then I was given this little laminated card. No, wait — first I signed the card, then she laminated it. I'm sorry, it all happened so fast. New card and half-and-half carton in hand, Zimmerman was told by Epps to return to the checkout aisle. More confusion followed. "The half-and-half rang up at its regular price," Zimmerman said. "I asked if I got a discount, and [Salgado] said no, because the half-and-half wasn't a $uper $aver's Club Special Of The Week. So I asked why she made me join the $uper $aver's Club, and she said she didn't make me join anything. Zimmerman's supervisor, Jack Thiele, noted his employee's state when Zimmerman returned to work at 2:44 p.m. "The color was drained from his face, and when I asked what was wrong, he mumbled something about a laminated card and 'they charged me full price,'" Thiele said. "I said that's it — no more ducking out of the office to get half-and-half or gum or whatever the hell. " Supermarket analyst Mark Ludovic said that while Zimmerman's case is extreme, customers, especially those with work or family concerns on their minds, are often unprepared for the opportunity to save. "When you enter Feltz Foods or any other supermarket chain, you should be aware that discounts can occur without warning," Ludovic said. "Often, these supermarkets play by their own rules, such as claiming to honor the lower prices of competitors when they are only referring to advertised prices. Unless you feel you can fully comprehend the fine print and are capable of membership in a savings club, the best way to handle these situations is to politely decline any offers and calmly exit the store. Saving a few cents on kidney beans is not worth the stress and bewilderment. In the wake of the incident, Zimmerman remains unsure of whether he'll ever use his Feltz $uper $aver's card. "I usually shop at Goodall's Grocery near my apartment," Zimmerman said. "It's more convenient. I don't think they have a savings club, either. God, I hope they don't."

Circus Runaway Not Looking Forward To Hometown Show
SACRAMENTO, CA — Michael MacAlester, who ran away from his native Sacramento at 16 to join the circus, is not looking forward to the Big Top Circus' show this Friday in his hometown. "The idea of getting the hell out of Sacramento and joining a traveling circus was really exciting, but I guess I should've thought to check the schedule," MacAlester, 18, a unicycling clown, said Monday. "I asked the ringmaster if I could possibly sit this one out, but he said no way. " MacAlester said he plans to wear extra-heavy make-up in case his parents happen to be in attendance.

Teens 'Going To Town' With Restaurant Comment Cards
TRAVERSE CITY, MI — Three teens eating at the North Henderson Street Country Kitchen diner "really went to town" with the restaurant's comment cards Sunday, third-shift manager Rick Wehl reported. "Yeah, there was a group of kids in that back booth last night," Wehl said Monday. "They sure were getting their jollies filling out those comment cards. Must have been at it for an hour and a half. The 17-year-olds — Christine Konkel, Aaron Malkus, and Jeffrey McIntosh — reached Tuesday at the same Country Kitchen location, said they entered the 24-hour family restaurant at 12:15 a.m. Sunday, after spending several hours driving up and down Central Avenue. According to Malkus, an hour after the teens sat down, shortly before they ordered food, he spotted the comment-card display near the register. He brought a stack of cards to the table, at which point the teens immediately began to fill them out, reading their comments to one other as they wrote. "The first spot was 'name,' so I wrote 'Oliver Clothesoff,'" McIntosh said. "I thought about writing 'Jack Hoff,' but I decided on 'Oliver Clothesoff' in the end. My dad's name is Oliver." Malkus wrote "Seymour Butts," while Konkel wrote "George W. Bush." "For age, I wrote 'to perfection' — you know, 'aged to perfection,' like wine," Malkus said. "And for zip code, I wrote in my regular zip code, because I couldn't think of anything funny. I could have written '666' and then '69,' but that would have just looked like four sixes and a nine. Despite the comment cards' lack of sex-related questions, the teens found a way to work the topic into their evaluations. The teens provided a number of risqué answers — phone numbers like "555-TITS" and "ASS-FUCK" and e-mail addresses such as "blowme@yahoo.com" among them. The question "Who served you today? " proved especially provocative. "I wish I'd been served by Cameron Diaz instead of some Country Kitchen asshole," Malkus wrote. "Or Anna Kournikova. She's hot. In the blank that requested the server's name, Konkel wrote "Dick Whale," in reference to Wehl, with whom the teens are familiar from their many recent trips to Country Kitchen. "Remember that time Jeffrey brought over a booster seat and sat in it? " Konkel asked. "And then [Wehl] came over and told us to 'cool it.' Wasn't that hilarious? He was like, 'Cool it, guys.' "Remember the time we asked The Whale for the crayons, and he wouldn't give them to us, but then we got some from the other table? " asked Malkus, who has hung a Country Kitchen placemat featuring sexually explicit crayon drawings in his locker. Konkel merely nodded, her attention focused on recounting the lengthy answers she provided to such simple multiple-choice questions as "What meal did you share with us? "I wrote, 'Sharing is caring, and I don't care to share my damn pancakes with anybody,'" Konkel said. "Then I got a better idea, so I put an asterisk next the question and wrote 'Christmas fucking dinner' on the back. To answer a question about the frequency of her trips to Country Kitchen, Konkel wrote that she visits Country Kitchen "way more than [she] should, considering what a shithole it is. " In response to the same question, Malkus wrote "(2x - 50) y." The group also provided creative answers to such open-ended questions as "How could your Country Kitchen experience have been improved? The teens agreed that Konkel's answer was the best: "Country Kitchen? Oh, shit, I thought I was at Red Lobster!" In spite of the good time they seemed to have had Sunday, the teens' appraisals of their overall dining experience were overwhelmingly negative. "It was a nightmare…a waking hellscape…of crappiness," McIntosh wrote. "It sucked more ass…than the whole…gay-ass staff combined. The comment cards' last question solicited suggestions for improvement, and the teens happily complied, their responses sharing an undercurrent of sexual frustration. "You want to know what you could do? "Malkus wrote. "Put in a stripper pole and have nude waitresses… You should also have edible food, lower prices, and free blow jobs. Konkel said the restaurant "should have midgets bring you the food and then they should sit in your lap and feed it to you. McIntosh's response was the group's favorite. He wrote, "This place needs way less depressed truckers, and way more 16- to 20-year-old single girls who like to get high. At 2:45 a.m., the teens finished their seventh pot of coffee, hid the tip under a plate, and got up to leave the restaurant. On the way out, Malkus slipped 11 comment-filled cards into the box near the front register. "I knew those kids were filling out comment cards over there," said Wehl, emptying the box at the end of his shift. "As long as the things don't end up on the floor, I don't care how many anyone takes. We've got a box of 5,000 in the back. Wehl looked at one of Malkus' cards, which happened to be on top, for several seconds before dropping the stack in the trash.

"I cannot express how deeply mortified I am," said John Aulter, 52, the boy's father. "I mean, where in the world did Cris get the idea to suffocate himself while jerking off?

Dominatrix Seems Preoccupied
RENO, NV — Local submissive Jack Traden announced Monday that his dominatrix, Mistress Varla of DV8, seems to have more on her mind than his humiliation. "Mistress Varla hasn't been herself lately," Traden said. "Last week, she commanded me to lick her boots clean, but when I finished, she just stared off into space." "When she finally noticed I was waiting, she ordered me into the cage for no reason," Traden continued. "What's the point? Usually, before she puts me into the cage, she scolds me about how bad I've been or tells me that I need to learn a lesson. If she's punishing me for doing a bad job on her boots, I need to know that. It wasn't humiliating, just confusing." Traden cited other examples of Mistress Varla's recent distraction. "The whipping — it's all over the place," Traden said. "I don't know whether she's trying to whip my ass or my elbows. It's just not the same getting flogged by someone who's barely paying attention. And her ordering-around has been totally indecisive." Added Traden: "I've seen her like this before — last year, when she lost her job at the bank." Especially worrisome to Traden, however, is Mistress Varla's sudden inability to tie the simplest of bondage knots. "When I first started seeing Mistress Varla, you can bet if she bound me to a rack I was staying there," Traden said. "Lately, the leather knots are either so loose that they come undone or so tight I get no circulation. I love it when she makes me suffer, but I don't want to lose a limb." Traden then related what he termed the saddest example of Mistress Varla's recent lack of attention to his humiliation needs. "[Mistress Varla] slapped a collar around my neck and started walking me around her basement like a dog," Traden said. "Usually, the collar is on nice and snug, but this time it started to slip right off. I felt bad for her, so I tried holding it on with my chin while I was crawling around, but she caught me. Man, she beat the holy hell out of me for that, which normally would be great, but in this case it seemed like she was just upset with herself for making a rookie mistake. Who wants a dominatrix with confidence issues?" Also unsettling to Traden is the sloppiness of Mistress Varla's appearance. "When I walk into her dungeon, Mistress Varla is usually the very image of sleek menace," Traden said. "Lately, though, her boots are all scuffed and there are runs in her black stockings. Last week, I noticed she'd even incorrectly tied her leather corset. I would've mentioned it, but Mistress demands that I put in my ball gag before I arrive." Traden said he is also disappointed with the state of Mistress Varla's torture chamber. "A month and a half ago, that place was spotless," he said. "The floor was so clean you could eat off of it, and believe me, I would know. Now, instead of looking like her slaves scrubbed it with toothbrushes, it's just another mildewy basement with a dust-covered iron maiden." Traden said he has no idea why Mistress Varla seems so distant, but noted that he is unlikely to find out. "To ask about her personal life would be an inappropriate breach of the B&D code," Traden said. "But that doesn't mean I'm not worried about her. She's very special to me, but if I told her that, she probably wouldn't put me on the spanking rack for a long time." Although he could find a new dominatrix, Traden said he believes in loyalty. "I've been with Mistress Varla too long to call it quits," Traden said. "There's a bond that would be difficult to reproduce. When I'm under her boot, it feels like a second home to me. When she's focused, there's no one in the world who can make me feel more like a worm than she can." In spite of this praise, Traden said he "can't keep paying top dollar for second-rate domination." "I like to be debased, but I'm no chump," Traden said. "I might have to take a break from being her chattel while she gets her head together. After a little break, I'm sure before you know it I'll be lashed to the floor, covered in hot wax, and happier than ever."

Area Man Supports The Troops He Didn't Go To High School With
KIRKSVILLE, MO — Jon Strauss, 22, a Kirksville video-store manager, announced Monday that he supports U.S. troops "100 percent" — with the exception of the ones with whom he went to high school. "My heart goes out to the troops, and I pray for their safe return," said Strauss, a 1998 graduate of Kirksville High School. "Except for that dick Andy Tischler. I hope the Iraqis capture him and torture his wedgie-inflicting ass. Though he expressed mixed feelings about the war against Iraq, Strauss said he feels it is vital for Americans to stand united behind the nation's fighting men and women in uniform. He draws the line, however, at his former classmates. "Troy Nowicki, this guy who was in my junior-year gym class, is in the Navy now," Strauss said. "He was on the football team, and he used to love to tease me and give me purple nurples and generally make my life miserable. Once, he head-butted me so hard, I couldn't hear for an hour. Fucking asshole. Yeah, I'm really praying for his safe return. Strauss has tied a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of his parents' home, where he is temporarily living, to show his support for the troops. He also sports an American-flag pin on his shirt at work. "We can't let our soldiers feel like they're also facing an enemy on the homefront," Strauss said. "They have enough to worry about without hearing that their own country isn't behind them. Could you imagine how demoralizing that would be? It would be as traumatic as the time I had to give a speech on the Teapot Dome scandal at a school assembly, and Ricky Dorner kept whipping pennies at me the whole time. Ricky's a Marine now, and I heard his division got deployed to Tikrit, where they came under heavy fire from the Republican Guard. Haven't heard a casualty report yet. Strauss, like many Americans, said he believes the U.S. has learned its lesson from its poor treatment of Vietnam War soldiers. Today, even the staunchest anti-war activist is likely to agree that the soldiers are only carrying out the will of the policy-makers and deserve the nation's sympathy and good wishes. "For a lot of young people, the military is the only option," Strauss said. "Like Frank Deroia, this burnout who used to sit at the back of the school bus and loudly make fun of my clothes every day. Well, he joined the Army, and now I guess he's being treated like some kind of hero because he was one of the troops who secured Baghdad International Airport. Meanwhile, I've got a bachelor's degree and I'm stuck in Kirksville working at Blockbuster. How is that fair? Strauss' friends say they are well aware of his feelings about America's troops. "Jon was very moved by the horrible POW ordeal of Pfc. Jessica Lynch," longtime friend Will Arbus said. "He said she seems like a really sweet girl, the kind of person who would treat classmates with kindness and respect. Nothing like Lance Corporal Craig Veryzer of the 103rd Infantry. Apparently, Craig was fond of ridiculing Jon's less-than-perfect skin. Boy, does Jon hate that prick.

Migrant Worker Family Thrilled To See Selves On Cover Of The Economist
SAN CARLOS, TX — A family of Mexican migrant workers was thrilled to find its picture on the cover of the Jan. 25 issue of The Economist, vegetable farmhand, factory laborer, and fruit picker Luis Moreno reported Monday. "Imagine my surprise when I walked past the newsstand and saw my own face on the cover of a magazine — a very respected international publication, no less," said Moreno, 34, speaking with the aid of a translator. "I couldn't believe it. I opened the magazine and there we were again, right there under the headline, 'Hard Harvest: The Enduring Plight Of Migrant Workers In America.' I ran to my wife with a copy of the issue as fast as I could and said, 'Hey, Rosa, we're famous! Ever since losing his job as a mechanic's assistant in Mexico City four years ago, Moreno, his wife Rosa, and their three young sons have roamed the American South and Midwest in search of seasonal labor. "Judging by the scenery and the size of little Esteban, I am guessing the photo was taken in north Texas, shortly after the October harvest," Moreno said. "We were relocating from the lower Rio Grande valley to Iowa, where I can usually find winter work in the slaughterhouses or the pork-processing plants. How lucky we were to be on that particular road that day! Continued Moreno: "I do not specifically remember anyone taking my picture, but that is not surprising if we were in the middle of traveling. It gets very tiring, of course, and sometimes you do not pay attention to distractions. Moreno praised The Economist's photo editor for choosing the cover image. "The clothes we were wearing created a very interesting pastiche of colors, which is probably why he chose that particular shot," Moreno said. "Also, the photographer caught us at a moment when our expressions powerfully conveyed the great weariness we were feeling. The seven-page cover story, which featured a second photo of the Moreno family inside the magazine, focused on George W. Bush and Mexican president Vicente Fox's long-running dispute over migrant workers and the legalization of undocumented Mexicans in the U.S. "I was so excited," Moreno said. "I had a little money saved, enough for three copies. I sent one home to Mexico to my grandmother, I put one away to keep nice, and the other I used to show all of my friends. Within hours of the issue hitting newsstands, Moreno said he began hearing from friends, coworkers, and relatives. "I call home to my mother in Oaxaca whenever I can, just to make sure everyone is okay, especially our little Juanita, who is too young to travel," Moreno said. "The first thing she says to me is, 'Your cousin Carlos called to say he saw you in The Economist. He says to call him right away. My son, the celebrity!' Rosa said the cover story has made her and the rest of the Moreno clan the talk of the migrant-worker community. "It's amazing how many people have seen it," Rosa said. "We were passing through Sebastian on the way to Progreso, and we stopped to visit some old friends from Mexico City who found work in a tannery. The first thing out of everyone's mouth was, 'Here comes the cover girl!' You should have seen me blush. "Our friend Miguel and his wife were teasing us, calling us 'undocumented migrants' like they did in the story," Rosa added, "but it was all in good fun. Moreno, who read the article with the help of a translator, said he felt The Economist's assessment of migrant workers and their plight was "evenhanded and intelligent. "Basically, the author of the article said migrant workers are net contributors to the economy of a country because they are disproportionately of working age, and the receiving country has not had to pay for their education," Moreno said. "And they pointed out that migration does not seem to increase unemployment among the native-born." "To be fair, it did say it may reduce their pay," Rosa said. "But I agree with Luis that it certainly was a fairer look at the subject than I have come to expect. "I've been treated badly by many people throughout my life," added Rosa, lowering her eyes to the floor. Though he does not expect to appear on another magazine cover any time soon, Moreno expressed hope that one day his family will have the luck to be interviewed by a Ph.D candidate conducting research in one of the seasonal worker camps. "It's amazing what a complex system of social ties we itinerant workers maintain, considering that we are always in motion and have only limited access to modern communications," Moreno said. "Don't you think that would make a fascinating subject for a dissertation?

Hotel Bar Really Hopping Tonight, Says Hotel Bartender
GRAND RAPIDS, MI — According to George Fontana, the Grand Rapids Hilton's Tiki Town bar and lounge is "really hopping tonight," the 46-year-old hotel bartender reported Monday. "Usually, Mondays are pretty slow around here," Fontana said. "But it's been non-stop since about 10. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure why. I'd say it was the dental-supply convention, but most of those fellas are staying over at the Radisson." Fontana added that if the rush keeps up, he may have to unlock the supply closet to get a fresh box of olive picks.

Maxim Reader Eager To Put Newly Acquired Knowledge Of Women To Use
MANASSAS, VA–Maxim subscriber Kevin Blynn, 23, looks forward to putting into practical use the advice and information about women he has gleaned from the popular men's lifestyle magazine, sources reported Tuesday. "I'm the kind of guy who likes to work all the angles, and no one has more angles for dealing with women than Maxim," Blynn said. "I just read an article on how to land a model by dressing really sloppy so she thinks you're an artist or musician or something. It's genius. I've been taking mental notes for about four months now, and it's almost time to put them into action. This subscription is really going to pay for itself. While Blynn, who started reading the magazine in January, is currently single, he anticipates his dating status will change when he begins "Project: Laid." "Until I found out about Maxim, I really didn't understand girls," Blynn said. "Now, I've got an edge. One article suggested I pretend to be gay to get women to let their defenses down. I mean, it's risky and could easily backfire, but if it works, I'll be swimming in it. Though he has gone on just one date in the past three months, Blynn is confident that his lonely, masturbation-intensive Saturday nights will soon come to an end. "The latest issue tells you how to turn any situation into guaranteed sex," Blynn said. "If there's a threat of a terrorist attack, you can turn that into terror sex. If you're in a foreign country, you can turn that into 'two ships in the night' sex. If your girlfriend's pissed off about something, you can turn that into hot, angry, I-hate-you sex. As soon as I get a girlfriend, I'm gonna try that last one out. Maxim, Blynn said, also offers valuable advice on how to bed female acquaintances. "The February issue had some kick-ass info on how to score with a female friend who just got dumped," Blynn said. "You have to come on all nice and sensitive until you seal the deal. The article said chicks love it, but you have to do it right, or they'll get pissed before you can get any of that pie. Blynn said he is confident that Maxim's road-tested tips will work for him. "A lot of the information and advice is from guys like me," Blynn said. "They're out there in the trenches trying out their tips before they print them, so I know they've got to be good. Those guys at Maxim get all the tail. In spite of Blynn's faith, his friends are skeptical of his reliance on the magazine for advice. "I doubt this'll work any better than anything else he's tried," former roommate Chris Komarek said. "Kevin was never good when it came to meeting women. He had a girlfriend for a few months in college and was really hurt when they broke up. If this Maxim stuff is building up his confidence, more power to him. It couldn't be any worse than when he used to run stuff in the 'Missed Connections' section of the personals, hoping to hook up with some girl he'd stared at in some coffee shop for hours. That was just sad.

Newlyweds Regret Saving Sex For Marriage
WETUMKA, OK — Two weeks after their Feb. 1 wedding, Matt and Liz Kuchen, both 32, regret remaining virgins until marriage. "Why the hell did I wait? " Liz said Tuesday. "I could've been having mind-blowing sex with dozens of guys these last 15 years, and instead I spent them making little uptight speeches about how it'll be more special if I hold out. " Matt agreed, saying, "Stacy Pratt totally would've done me. Oh, man.

Teen Anxious For Cigarette Addiction To Kick In
EVANSVILLE, IN — Ashleigh Davis, 14, who started smoking three weeks ago, "can't wait" for her cigarette addiction to kick in. "Right now, I'm smoking, like, four or five cigarettes a day, but I definitely don't feel like I'm hooked yet," Davis said Tuesday. "That's gonna be so cool when the nicotine kicks in, and I have to, like, sneak out of restaurants and stuff for a fix.

Elderly Man Silently Wages War Against Pharmacy
AKRON, OH — Local retiree Gerald Stennis, 87, has been waging a silent war against the Copley Road Walgreens for the past two months, family members told reporters Monday. "I don't know what his problem is," daughter Lily Bergeron said. "Every time he goes in for his medicine, there's some kind of incident. Going to Walgreens used to be the highlight of his week, because the pharmacists all love him, but lately that's all changed. Last week, he knocked over a candy display. The store manager said he saw Dad kicking the candy bars down the aisle, even though he flatly denies it. I just know he's doing it on purpose. Stennis has refused to explain his behavior, denying that there is any feud between himself and Walgreens. "When I ask him what's going on between him and the pharmacy, he acts like I'm being crazy," Bergeron said. "That doesn't stop him from taking the manager's reserved parking spot every time he drives over there. He never did that until two months ago, so you can tell something is fishy. Stennis' friends seem equally mystified by his strange vendetta. "I don't know what's going on," said longtime friend Ed Bollinger, 81. "All I know is that when it's rainy, he makes a point to not wipe his feet on the mats and tracks mud all over their nice floors. If Gerry hadn't been a loyal customer for the past 15 years, I don't think they'd put up with his shenanigans. Theories regarding the source of Stennis' feud with the pharmacy vary. "Dad got the wrong medication a few months ago," Bergeron said. "But the pharmacist himself called to tell us they'd made a mistake before Dad even got home. They even sent someone to our house to make the switch. Dad was pretty steamed over that, but that's no reason for him to keep peeling the price tags off the vitamin bottles. It has to be something else. Bollinger said Stennis may be protesting certain store decisions. "Gerry's been complaining more and more about the Walgreens," Bollinger said. "He's been upset ever since they stopped stocking Tetley iced tea [in 1998]. But I think the final straw was when Rosalita, his favorite cashier, got fired. That was six months ago, but I think he considered it a real slap in the face. Because Stennis has been known to harbor a temper, some family members suspect that the grudge arose from an argument with an employee. "Lily asked me to stop in to find out if Dad had picked a fight with the manager or something," son Ryan Stennis said. "Everyone at the store seemed genuinely surprised that there were any ill feelings. Apparently, this battle Dad is fighting is completely one-sided, and he won't say what the hell is going on. To date, Stennis' war against the pharmacy has largely consisted of petty acts of sabotage, but his daughter fears that escalation may be imminent. "Dad's a stubborn guy," Bergeron said. "Right now, he's just doing stuff like knocking over displays and asking stock boys to see if they have any cherry-flavored Metamucil in the back and then walking out before they return. I'm just worried that one day he'll do something crazy, like pull the fire alarm. Though Walgreens expressed an eagerness to make peace, no resolution appears to be forthcoming. "If something is bothering Mr. Stennis, I'd be more than happy to discuss it with him," Walgreens manager Marianne Krieg said. "He's a valued customer. However, we are unsure how to make the first step toward peace, since no one has any clue what we did to upset him. Added Krieg: "And I sure as heck would like him to stop opening the tennis-ball cans, so we don't have to call the police or ban him from the store.

Free Condom Harsh Reminder Of Sexless Existence
SANTA CRUZ, CA — A free condom served as a harsh reminder of the sexless existence Julie Tudor has endured since February 2002, the 31-year-old bookstore manager reported Tuesday. "Uh, thanks," said Tudor, reluctantly accepting a LifeStyles Xtra Pleasure condom attached to a brochure containing detailed information on proper use of the prophylactic. "But I really don't, uh, okay, thanks. At approximately 2 p.m., while cutting across the University of California–Santa Cruz campus en route to a coffee shop, Tudor encountered a table featuring a hand-painted sign urging passersby to practice safe sex. She was immediately offered a condom by Stephanie Loughlin, a volunteer for the campus organization UC–Santa Cruz Safe-Sex Alliance. "I could've told them to save it for someone who has even a remote chance of actually using it, but I still have some dignity," said Tudor, who hasn't needed a prophylactic since her Feb. 14, 2002 split with then-boyfriend Doug Ryback. "God, if they only knew how little they were helping me. Tudor said she smiled politely when Loughlin, a bubbly 20-year-old, bounded up to her and urged her to "play it safe. "I didn't want to say that in the 11 months since Doug and I broke up, I really haven't been 'playing it' at all," Tudor said. "Thanks for reminding me. Tudor said she still has plenty of unused condoms at home. "I have a box that hasn't been touched since the breakup," Tudor said. "I know they're still there, because I checked for them before going out with that jerk stockbroker Michelle set me up with last month. Tudor initially tried to avoid the safe-sex booth, pretending not to hear Safe-Sex Alliance volunteer Ryan Schumann when he shouted, "Free condom? " Misinterpreting Tudor's efforts to sidestep the booth as discomfort with the subject of sex, Schumann targeted her for additional education. "Some people don't like talking about sex, which is why outreach programs like ours are so vitally important," said Schumann, 19. "I told her not to be embarrassed, and that sexuality is a normal, healthy part of everyone's life.' "Everyone's except mine," Tudor replied when told of Schumann's remarks. "I decided to spare him that detail, though, and let him blather on about mutual respect and positive sexuality and something about a dance at the student union on the last Friday of every month. Despite not needing protection from unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, Tudor was offered a choice of condoms by Trojan, Durex, Trustex, inSpiral, and Crown — all placed in a fishbowl along with complimentary packets of Astroglide lubricant and Wet-brand flavored lube pillows. "When I sort of frowned at the condom in my hand, they pulled me over to pick any that I liked better from their cornucopia of condoms," Tudor said. "Lubricated, non-lubricated, for-her-pleasure, for-his, mint-flavored. They even had ones wrapped in foil that looked like candy coins. Which, I hate to admit, caught my eye for a second. Chocolate, I would've had some use for. Declining the offer of an alternate condom, Tudor grudgingly accepted a brochure containing "fun and safe" sex practices to try with her purely theoretical partner. She also took a printed sheet listing local health clinics that provide free testing for STDs, a brochure on the correct use of dental dams, and a photocopy of an article about female condoms — none of which remotely interested her. In the two weeks since Tudor's last major sex-related letdown — her failure to get laid on New Year's Eve despite a willingness to sleep with anyone even slightly attractive — sex had largely been relegated to the back of her mind. On Tuesday, however, Tudor was reminded of her sexless existence every time she opened her purse and saw the free condom. "Back in college, when I was screwing with reasonable regularity, I'd actually spend time thinking about the subject [of safe sex]," Tudor said. "I'd worry if carrying a condom in my purse was being too forward. I'd think, is it okay to have sex with friends? What sort of stuff do I want to explore? Are threesomes safe? I had no idea that one day, my safe-sex questions would boil down to, 'Where can I get some?' Loughlin, who has volunteered for UC–Santa Cruz Safe-Sex Alliance since September, said she sees the unwillingness of some people to discuss sex as a problem facing safe-sex activists. "Some people are, like, really weird about sex, and that totally sucks," said Loughlin, adjusting a "Be On The Safe Side!" banner. "That's why I'm here. The more open everyone is about it, the less people will die. "God, I remember back when I was her age," Tudor said. "I was dating this guy who lived in Arizona, but I kept cheating on him with this guy on my dorm floor: Kyle? Karl? He was a rock climber, a real outdoorsy type — kinda skinny but strong. You know, with these nice knotty muscles. I'm sorry, what was your question?

Casual Sex Surprisingly Formal
DAYTONA BEACH, FL — After several hours of drunken Spring Break revelry Monday, Ron Viselic, 19, and Becky Pell, 18, returned to Pell's motel room for surprisingly formal casual sex. "We were laughing and doing body shots at the bar, but when we got back to my room, things turned all businesslike," Pell said. "He kept asking me if it was okay to take off each piece of clothing, then he wouldn't do anything but missionary. " Following the methodical, strangely businesslike intercourse, Viselic and Pell spent five minutes "spooning" before Viselic dressed and left.

Mommy Having Sleepover
GALESBURG, IL — Five days after Daddy's disappearance, Mommy hosted "Uncle" Rick at a sleepover, 5-year-old Hannah Dalton reported Monday. "They drank a lot of that special soda for grownups, and they watched movies," Hannah said. "And later, they must have told ghost stories, because I heard them both moaning and screaming. " The morning after the sleepover, a departing Rick permitted Hannah to eat as much Count Chocula as she wanted, as long as she did not wake Mommy.

Skeptic Pitied
FAYETTEVILLE, AR — Craig Schaffner, 46, a Fayetteville-area computer consultant, has earned the pity of friends and acquaintances for his tragic reluctance to embrace the unverifiable, sources reported Monday. "I honestly feel sorry for the guy," said neighbor Michael Eddy, 54, a born-again Christian. "To live in this world not believing in a higher power, doubting that Christ died for our sins — that's such a sad, cynical way to live. I don't know how he gets through his day. " Coworker Donald Cobb, who spends roughly 20 percent of his annual income on telephone psychics and tarot-card readings, similarly extended his compassion for Schaffner. "Craig is a really great guy," Cobb said. "It's just too bad he's chosen to cut himself off from the world of the paranormal, restricting himself to the limited universe of what can be seen and heard and verified through empirical evidence. Also feeling pity for Schaffner is his former girlfriend Aimee Brand, a holistic and homeopathic healer who earns a living selling tonics and medicines diluted to one molecule per gallon in the belief that the water "remembers" the curative properties of the medication. "Don't get me wrong — logic and reason have their place," Brand said. "But Craig fails to recognize the danger of going too far with medical common sense to the exclusion of alternative New Age remedies like chakra cleansing and energy-field realignment. Eddy said he has tried repeatedly to pull Schaffner back from the precipice of lucidity. "I admit, science might be great for curing diseases, exploring space, cataloguing the natural phenomena of our world, saving endangered species, extending the human lifespan, and enriching the quality of that life," Eddy said. "But at the end of the day, science has nothing to tell us about the human soul, and that's a critical thing Craig is missing. I would hate for his soul to be lost forever because of a stubborn doubt over the actual existence and nature of that soul. Gina Hitchens, a lifelong astrology devotee, blamed Schaffner's lack of faith on an accident of birth. "Craig can't entirely help himself, being a Gemini," Hitchens said. "Geminis are always very skeptical and destined to feel pain throughout life as a result of their closed-mindedness. If you try to introduce Craig to anything even remotely made-up, he starts going off about 'evidence this' and 'proof that.' If only the poor man were open-minded enough to stop attacking everything with his brain and just once look into his heart, he'd find all the proof he needed. But, sadly, he's unable to let even a little bit of imagination drive his core beliefs. Perhaps the person who pities Schaffner most is his brother Frank, a practicing Scientologist since 1991. "It's bad enough when someone has the ignorance to reject Dianetics in spite of its tremendous popularity," Frank said. "But Craig isn't even willing to try a free introductory course. Scientology has the potential to free humanity from the crippling yoke of common sense, unshackling billions from the chains of century after century of scientific precedent, and yet he still won't give it a try.

Ken, Barbie Reenact Parental Fight
SPARTA, TN — A pair of Mattel Barbie and Ken dolls reenacted a fight between the parents of Amanda Lytle, 6, in the girl's bedroom Monday. "Where were you so late last night? " Pop Sensation Barbie asked Ken at approximately 7 p.m., just after bath time. "What time did you get home? It was way past your bedtime when you got in. Angrily bobbing across Lytle's bedspread to the pillow against which Ken lounged, Barbie raised her arm parallel to the floor and menacingly leaned toward Ken. "I suppose you were down at that bar again with your dumb friends, weren't you? " Barbie said. "Why don't you call me when you're going to be late? Don't you think I worry? "If you know where I am, why do you need me to call? " responded Palm Beach Ken, dressed in a pair of Velcro-closed pants and a blue stretch pullover emblazoned with his name. "Besides, I only go to the bar because people are nice to me there instead of being mean and picking on me like you do. Lytle stared thoughtfully at the dolls before picking up Barbie, who raised her arm again and spoke. "If the policeman stops you, he's going to give you a ticket, and then you will be sorry," Barbie said. "The last time you got one, it was for $4. We don't have money to give to the policeman. You were naughty. While Barbie changed shoes, Lytle explained the conflict between the dolls to a row of Beanie Babies seated nearby. "Barbie is mad at Ken because he said he was coming home after work, but then he didn't," Lytle said. "But Ken said he had to work late, so he should be able to go where he wants. And he didn't want to call because Barbie always gets mad at him and yells when he calls, so he doesn't call. But that makes Barbie maaaad. She's going to the kitchen. "Slam, slam, slam! " said Barbie, facing the wall. "I'm making dinner. Rising from his seated position, still bent at the waist, Ken bobbed over to an empty Hostess Twinkies box on the floor next to the bed and climbed inside. "I'm going to Circus City," said Ken, revving the Twinkies box's engine. "That's the place with all the TVs for sale where we went that time Uncle Dale needed to get batteries for his camera. "Go ahead," Barbie said. "See you in five hours. Have a nice time at the bar. "What is that supposed to mean? " Ken asked. "I said I was going to go to Circus City in my car. You've been yelling at me all week to get a new plug for the toaster. Now I go, and you are yelling at me. "Fine, just don't buy anything else," Barbie said. "We don't have any money because you drink all the money. Added Barbie: "We should get our daughter lots of nice presents and throw her a birthday party and get her a bike and a cat instead. Throwing herself forward into a horizontal position on the bed, Barbie cried loudly. "Do you love me anymore? " Barbie asked. "Boo hoo hoo. If you don't love me anymore, tell me. "Vroom, vroom, vroom," said Ken, zooming the Twinkies box across the room to the dresser. "I have to get out of this nuthouse. I am going crazy. I'm going to go to Circus City to get the new plug for the toaster. Ken then drove off to Circus City, located on Lytle's dresser. After walking around the surface of the dresser several times, Ken climbed back into the Hostess box and returned home to find Barbie hiding under the pillow. "Knock, knock, knock," said Ken, rapping his open palm on the pillow. "I'm home from Circus City. I got the plug, and I got a movie on DVD. I got it because I know you wanted to see it. Come out, and we will make some microwave popcorn, and we can watch the movie on the couch. It's a movie with kissing in it. After nearly 10 seconds of silence, Barbie emerged from beneath the pillow. "I told you not to buy anything," Barbie said. "We don't have any money. "I got it for you," Ken said. "It's a movie for us to play. We can make the kids go to bed, and we can lay on the couch in our pajamas and watch it and drink beers together. And we can laugh a lot, but the kids will have to stay in bed even though it is not fair. "Okay, let's watch the movie," said Barbie, hugging Ken with outstretched arms and pressing her face to his. "Kiss, kiss, kiss. "I'm sorry," Ken said. "I love you. Barbie then joined Ken in a seated position on the windowsill. The pair sat motionless for several minutes while Lytle headed downstairs to the kitchen for a juice box. Upon returning, she collected the reconciled dolls and threw them on the floor of the closet. In the past week, Barbie and Ken have reenacted five parental fights. The most heated exchange came last Friday, when the dolls engaged in a screaming match over whether Barbie's sister Skipper should be allowed to come over any time she wants without calling.

Friendship Moving Way Too Fast
GLENDALE, CA — Expressing a desire to "slow things down and keep it casual," Troy Lanier, 28, said Monday that his friendship with Scott Perotta, 27, is moving way too fast. "[Scott]'s a nice enough guy, but I've only known him for, like, five weeks, and he already acts like we're best friends," said Lanier, a Glendale-area insurance adjuster. "I wish I had stronger feelings for him, but I don't. I just don't know where I want this friendship to go, and I need the space to figure it all out. Seen as a potentially good match based on their shared love of martial-arts films, Lanier and Perotta were introduced by a mutual friend in early January. "The first night we hung out, we went to see Five Fingers Of Death at the revival theater," Lanier said. "It was nice, but things started accelerating much too quickly from there. He's always inviting me out to do stuff, and he calls me every time there's a Jackie Chan movie on TV. Within a few weeks of meeting Scott, I was talking to him more than Rob [Poehler], who's been my best friend since high school. Lanier said he has been reluctant to give Perotta his e-mail address, fearing it will only accelerate the friendship. "I just know he'd be e-mailing me every day," Lanier said. "He's always talking about these funny things he sees on the Internet. I've been thinking about setting up a special Yahoo! account and giving him that address with the caveat that I only check it once in a while, but that seems like an awful lot of effort to deal with someone I barely know. According to Lanier, Perotta has also attempted to strengthen their bond through the disclosure of highly personal information. "I know more about Scott than I do about people I've known for years," Lanier said. "He told me about how his mother was an alcoholic and how his uncle committed suicide in his garage. I try to steer the conversation back to neutral subjects, but try bringing up Sammo Hung movies after someone tells you his ex-girlfriend was sexually molested when she was 12." Lanier has also taken exception to Perotta's habit of referring to him by nicknames. "He's always calling me things like 'Laney' or 'Troy-Boy,'" Lanier said. "My old high-school friends and I have nicknames for each other, but that's different. Until we've known each other a while, I'd prefer to be called Troy — or, at worst, Lanier." The final straw, Lanier said, came this past Sunday, when he received an unexpected gift from Perotta. "He stopped by my house to borrow a CD, and my heart just dropped when he handed me a present," Lanier said. "It was a poster for They Call Me Bruce. I like the movie okay, but there's no way I'm putting it on my wall. That's the last thing I need, for Scott to come over and see some token of our everlasting friendship hanging over my bed. Lanier said the situation might have been different had he met Perotta when he was in college. "I was more open to meeting new people back then," Lanier said. "You live in the dorms, you meet people in classes, you go to parties, and so on. But I have so much more going on in my life now. Before I get too deep into a new friendship, I've got to make sure it's going to be worth the trouble to maintain. Dr. Karen Franks, a Cornell University sociologist, said Lanier's predicament is not unusual. "People make friends at different speeds," Franks said. "The key is to be honest and firm with people who try to take things too fast. Troy and Scott may end up being best friends someday, but until then, they should proceed at a rate comfortable for them both. If they don't, things will burn out, leaving one of them spending months awkwardly trying to get back his Jet Li DVDs."

Newly Out Gay Man Overdoing It
PENSACOLA, FL — Calling his flamboyant air and effeminate mannerisms "a bit forced," friends of recently out-of-the-closet homosexual Mark Glynn, 23, say he's overdoing it. "When Mark first told us he was gay, everybody was totally cool with it," longtime friend Rich Eddy said. "We figured he'd basically be the same old Mark, except he'd be dating guys. Boy, were we wrong. Though Glynn's friends expected him to become comfortable and open with his sexuality, they did not expect him to go to such great lengths to proclaim his preference for men at every conceivable turn. "We just figured he'd start saying stuff to us at bars like, 'Check out that cute guy's butt,'" Eddy said. "But he takes pains to telegraph his gayness 24 hours a day. Last night, a bunch of us were talking about what's going on with Bush and Iraq, when, out of nowhere, he says, 'You know what Bush needs? A good ass-fucking. That'd relax him.' It's like, 'Okay, Mark, we get it already — you're gay.' Continued Eddy: "It's like he's scared that if he doesn't wear hot pants and say 'You go, girl!' a lot, somebody might think he's straight. Lydia Richter, another longtime friend of Glynn's, has also noticed the change. "We can't have a conversation without him mentioning some aspect of gay culture," Richter said. "No matter what it is — art, comedy, movies, restaurants, philosophy — he goes off on how it affects him as a gay man. Mark, we've accepted that you like the dick, so just shut up and be gay already. Even Andrew Storch, a gay coworker of Glynn's who recently went on several dates with him, said Glynn is "laying on the gay a little heavy. "After Mark came out, he said he'd been attracted to me for a long time," Storch said. "We went out a few times, but he constantly acted like he had something to prove. Everywhere he went, he was mincing around like RuPaul at Wigstock. And, Lord, you should have seen the shoes he was wearing on our second date. I realize he's excited about being out of the closet, but you don't have to make up for those lost years of gayness all at once. Added Storch: "I hope I wasn't like that when I came out. Of all the aspects of Glynn's life, friends say his wardrobe has undergone the most drastic change. Instead of wearing khakis and understated dress shirts, Glynn now opts for brightly patterned sleeveless T-shirts and tight short-shorts. "Two weeks after he came out, he showed up at a party in little pink biker shorts and an open button-down shirt with nothing on underneath," Eddy said. "This is a guy who once said wearing blue jeans made him feel 'weird.' Now, he says he's saving up to buy a whole leather get-up with harnesses and metal studs. I don't know where he got the idea that real gay people actually wear that stuff in their daily lives. Glynn has adopted a number of other stereotypically gay affectations, including finger-snapping, a "swishy" walk, and calling everyone "sweetie" or "girlfriend." "I guess he's picking it up from some of the gay guys he meets when he goes out, but it's just not him," Storch said. "A few times, I've actually caught him doing the limp-wrist thing. All that's missing is the lisp. Even Glynn's drinking habits have taken on a gay tone. "Mark used to be a single-malt scotch drinker," Eddy said. "Now it's Cosmos or Mai Tais. I didn't realize that liking men altered your taste buds. According to Dirk Yunger, author of You're Here, You're Queer, Get Used To It: The New Millennium Guide To Coming Out Of The Closet, it is common for "late bloomers" like Glynn to over-embrace homosexuality. "Mark has been hiding his true sexuality for so long, he can't help but want to shout it out to the world," Yunger said. "His friends should give him time to figure out how his newfound sexual openness will fit into his larger persona. Eventually, he will level out and become more like the Mark they used to know. In the meantime, his friends will have to endure a lot of annoying conversations about 14-inch dildos and what he'd like to do to Rupert Everett. Christ, I don't envy them.

Lackluster Marriage Enlivened By Cancer Scare
SWANDER, OH — George and Maureen McKay's stagnant, passionless 36-year marriage was briefly enlivened recently by Maureen's late-May cancer scare. "When the doctor told us Maureen had terminal stomach cancer, our priorities instantly changed," said George, 57, who had steadily grown more distant from his wife over the decades. "Suddenly, all that mattered was spending those final days together. "Last week, we found out the doctor made a misdiagnosis," George continued. "Now, thank God, everything's back to the way it was before. On May 25, Dr. Ernest Ingersoll, an oncologist at Dreyer General Hospital in nearby Tiffin, told the couple that a malignant mass in Maureen's stomach was Phase 4 stomach cancer. The grave diagnosis temporarily reignited a passion between George and Maureen that the weight of the years had dulled. "When we got home from the hospital, we both couldn't stop crying," said Maureen, 56, who was later correctly diagnosed with gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis, a rare but nonfatal fungal disease. "George just held me for hours and hours. I hadn't felt that loved and cared for in years. According to those who know the couple, this closeness was precisely what has been missing from the McKay marriage. "Maureen and George weren't what you would call the most romantic couple," next-door neighbor Curtis Curran said. "But when they thought Maureen had cancer, there was an instant change. You could even see it in the way they sat next to each other. Of course, now that they found out Maureen will be fine with treatment, they're back to opposite sides of the room again. Faced with the grim prospect of cancer, the McKays began to pay attention to "all the little things" that make a marriage special. "We started to say 'I love you' again, for no reason," Maureen said. "I guess George was afraid it might be the last time he'd get to say it. Thank God, it wasn't. Not that he's said it since we found out the diagnosis was wrong. In the days following Maureen's initial diagnosis, George would call her from work just to see how her day was going. He also started leaving her little love notes in random spots throughout the house. "It sure was an emotional three weeks," George said. "We'd stay up all night long, saying things we'd never said to each other and talking about all the things we never got to do together. Now, we've got a whole damn lifetime to do all that stuff with each other. "Twenty or thirty more years," George added. "Just the two of us. As soon as Maureen's stomach problems were found to be nonfatal, the couple returned to their normal mode of interaction: icy silence punctuated by the occasional bickering over petty household matters. An added source of tension was Maureen's medical treatments, which prompted fights about everything from who forgot to deposit the check from the insurance company to who was supposed to pick up the medicine from the pharmacy before it closed at 7 p.m. Still, the couple has their memories of the whirlwind three weeks. One moment in particular sticks out in Maureen's mind. A few days after the misdiagnosis, George presented her with a thick woolen sweater to wear around the house if she felt cold. It had been years since he had bought her a present out of the blue. "I was so touched that I cried," said Maureen, holding up the unattractive purple-and-green sweater. "Before, I would have made fun of this ugly thing and shoved it in the closet, but instead, I wore it every day. I mean, until I found out I was okay. I haven't worn it since. It's really not my style. Settling back into their pre-cancer-scare routine, the couple has canceled the vacation they had planned, deciding it would be wiser to put the money toward a new roof on their home. "Boy, am I glad that's all over," George said. "Now we can get back to being a normal married couple again.

Search For Public Restroom An Epic Ordeal Of Alienation, Humiliation, Human Cruelty
AMES, IA — A local resident's search for a public bathroom became an epic odyssey of alienation, humiliation, and human cruelty Monday. "You have no idea what I've been through," said Pete Webster, 27, recovering from the harrowing ordeal in his apartment. "From endless 'Bathroom For Paying Customers Only' signs to toilets so disgusting they're unsuitable for vomiting, I saw it all. Webster's bathroom search began at approximately 1:15 a.m., 30 minutes after leaving Burrito Bob's, where he consumed a double enchilada platter and a 32-ounce Pepsi. Though he felt fine upon exiting the popular late-night eatery, he soon felt an overwhelming need to defecate. "I should've gone at Burrito Bob's," said Webster, who had spent the night barhopping with friends. "But I didn't have to go when I left. Besides, I figured I could always just dart into a gas station or some 24-hour restaurant and do the deed. "What I failed to factor in," Webster continued, "is the unfathomable darkness of the human soul. Rather than head back to his west-side apartment, a 25-minute walk from the downtown area, Webster made the fateful decision to search for a public restroom. His first stop was the Rite-Aid 24-hour pharmacy on West Gentry Street. Asking for the bathroom, he was told by a cashier that the facilities were for employee use only. "I offered to buy a candy bar or something, but this bitch cashier said that wouldn't make any difference," Webster said. "How could a drugstore not have a public bathroom? Explain that one to me. Isn't public health in the interest of a drugstore? What's a more basic public-health issue than having to take a shit? The pressure on his bowels steadily building, Webster was able to obtain the key to the men's room of an Amoco gas station on Kellogg Avenue at 1:50 a.m. But an unspeakable horror awaited him. "The toilet was backed up, and sewage had slopped over the lid of the toilet onto the floor," Webster said. "There was no toilet paper, no soap, no paper towels, and no stall door. Still, I decided to go for it. Gingerly attempting to hover above the bowl without making contact, Webster stopped himself when he was suddenly overcome by a fear of splashback. He promptly returned the key to the gas-station attendant. "I told the guy the restroom was unusable," Webster said. "He gave me this look, like I was acting like some sort of diva. Unable to find a place to defecate, Webster decided to give himself partial relief by urinating. Even this effort, however, brought nothing but torment and pain. "I snuck behind a tree to piss, but I couldn't get the piss going without the rest coming out, too," Webster said. "Sometimes, I can take a piss when I actually have to do more, but this time it would've been too much to hold back. At 2:10 a.m., Webster encountered a group of Iowa State University students, who directed him to the school's student union. "They said, 'Oh, yeah, there's a bunch of bathrooms in [the union]. Just head a few blocks down Marston and take a right at 12th Street, you can't miss it,'" Webster said. "When I got there, the whole place was lit up. I can't tell you how happy I was running up the steps of that building. The building was locked, closed since midnight. "When I saw the union was closed, I started thinking about that one guy who was having a hard time keeping a straight face while the other rattled off the directions," Webster said. "I guess they decided to have a little fun at my expense. I didn't know them, and they didn't know me. It was just a bit of senseless, cruel fun. I guess they didn't realize they were toying with a broken, desperate man. The student-union episode was followed by several more spirit-crushing glimpses into the howling void. Webster encountered a Port-A-Potty in a local park which turned out to be padlocked, was denied restroom access by the acerbic employees of a bail-bonds office, and came across a convenience-store restroom dubiously declared "out of order" by a makeshift sign scrawled on notebook paper. Finally, at 2:45 a.m., Webster decided to accept defeat and begin the 25-minute walk home. Within moments of opening the apartment door, relief was his. "In retrospect, I should've just gone home right at the start," Webster said. "But I really thought it'd be faster to find a place downtown than to walk home. Even when I hit the one-hour mark, I still thought I'd find one any second. That's the thing about bathroom searches: No matter how bad it's going, you still think some mythical golden stall with a clean seat and a fresh roll of paper is just around the corner. The ordeal has given Webster new perspective on society's treatment of outsiders. "Before last night, I never realized what second-class citizens people without ready access to toilets are," Webster said. "I'll tell you one thing: If I ever encounter someone in that situation, I will not put them through this. I'll let them use my own toilet, or personally drive them around until we find a halfway-decent crapper.

Price Of Penis-Shaped Swimming Pool Negotiated
LAKE TAHOE, NV — The price of a customized penis-shaped swimming pool was negotiated down Monday, when purchaser Rocky Morgan persuaded contractor Lou Visconti to agree to a $12,000 reduction in price. "Right off the bat, I told Rocky I can do it, but it ain't gonna be cheap," said Visconti, owner of Mirage Pools. "First, there's a fee for the original design. And a lot more man hours go into laying a custom pool than one of those quick-and-dirty ready-made jobbers. Morgan, a former executive at Arista Records and now the owner of an adult-DVD distribution company, came up with the idea for the penis pool after seeing a guitar-shaped pool at a friend's house in Malibu, CA. "If you know Rocky Morgan, you know what his number-one skill is," said Morgan, 52, alluding to his sexual prowess. "People are impressed with my mirror room and my velvet-covered bar, but I knew a pool like this would make my Tahoe vacation house something guests would never forget. After pondering the pool idea for a few weeks, Morgan called several contractors for estimates. While a number of the contractors provided rough, non-binding estimates over the phone, only Visconti was willing to pay a personal visit to Morgan's home. "There was no way of knowing how to fit that pool in there without getting down in the backyard and actually scoping out the site," Visconti said. "I wasn't about to tease Rocky with a cock pool I couldn't deliver just to get his business. Though impressed with Visconti's professionalism, Morgan said he was shocked by his initial $89,000 estimate. "I was looking in a catalog, and most of the pools in there were in the $30,000 range," Morgan said. "I knew the one I wanted would be more, but 89 Gs? That's steep for any pool, whether it looks like a dick or not. Visconti assured Morgan that spending the extra money for a quality penis pool would pay off in the long run. "Sure, you can get someone else to do it for less, but they're gonna cut corners, do a shoddy job," Visconti told him. "In two, three years, you're going to have cracks up and down the shaft, the scrotal area is going to cave in, and then you'll need me to come fix it. And believe me, you're gonna pay a lot more down the line than if you spend the money up front. According to Visconti, many factors contribute to the final cost of a pool. Among them are the quality of materials, the type of wiring for the filtration system, and the amount of decorative detail — which Morgan decided to keep to a minimum, leaving the veins and ridges to swimmers' imagination. "This is Nevada, and the penis is going to be out in the sun all year round," Visconti said. "If you don't do it right, the paint is going to be peeling like nobody's business, especially on that highly detailed area down by the glans. Something like that in your backyard is gonna make property values plummet. Visconti is more than qualified to advise Morgan on penis-pool designs. He has 15 years experience in the custom-pool business and has been called "the best in Nevada," having built pools shaped like pianos, palm trees, and slot machines. In spite of his conviction that one must pay for quality, Visconti ultimately agreed to shave $12,000 off the cost of the pool. "I could have said 'no can do' and walked away," Visconti said. "But then he wouldn't have his penis by Labor Day, and I would've lost a chance to satisfy a valued customer. Visconti lowered the estimate by agreeing to absorb 15 percent of labor costs (approximately $6,500) and scaling down the pool's dimensions. The pool, originally slated for 80 meters, will be 50 meters in length, ranging in depth from three feet in the shallow play area at the base of the cock to 12 feet at the head, where a diving board will be positioned. Hand rails and steps will be built in the scrotal area, as well as midway down the shaft. A triangular deck will be added at the base, and bushes will be planted to create the effect of pubic hair. While Morgan initially wanted to have a pair of hot tubs for the pool's testicles, the idea proved too costly. And though he wanted the pool to have a 17-meter-wide shaft, Visconti ultimately convinced him to build it a more lifelike 10 meters. "So long as you build the cock a reasonable thickness, you're going to have a real nice lap pool on your hands," Visconti said. "Form follows function. That's what I always tell people. Visconti said Morgan let him see a faxed proposal from his competitor at Swan Lake Pools. "You should have seen this thing," Visconti said. "They had the whole thing running east-west, with a deck along the length. It would have looked like a brace, for Christ's sake. Then, they were going to paint the bottom blue. Come on. I can see white, black, maybe even pink. But blue? Who's ever seen a blue dong? It's ridiculous. Visconti said Morgan made the right choice to go with Mirage Pools. "Some of these outfits just pour concrete," Visconti said. "At Mirage, we use steel reinforcing rods to make a nice, sturdy, stiff base and shot crete, which has rock sand for extra strength. That'll keep your pool in top shape for a long time, hard as a rock when you're 80."

Everyone In Family Claims To Be The Black Sheep
STOCKTON, CA — Citing numerous examples of ostracization and failure to fit in, all of Paul and Martha Klessig's three children see themselves as the black sheep of the family. "I've always been the outcast," said son Jack Klessig, 21, a video-store assistant manager and aspiring musician. "Everybody else in my family, they're all, like, these total straight arrows and super-responsible. I'm the only one who's wandered off the traditional path." Continued Jack: "Mom and Dad are so proud of Anna and Tim. See, Tim is engaged and is co-owner of a landscaping business, and Anna is actually using her art degree to do her metal work. I got a history degree, but I'm just doing my thing, hoping the band takes off. They think I'm wasting my education and going nowhere." Tim, at 29 the oldest of the three Klessig children, feels a similar sense of alienation from the family. "I am definitely the odd man out," Tim said. "Mom and Dad know that I'm the only one who smokes pot. You'd think that being in a band, Jack would be a big pot guy, but he doesn't do any drugs. Same with Anna. You gotta be straitlaced to fit in with the Klessigs, and I'm anything but." "It also doesn't help that I'm the oldest but still the least responsible," Tim added. "Jack always remembers birthdays and is really good about keeping in touch with phone calls and e-mails, even though he lives in another city. Anna gives Mom and Dad the most thoughtful gifts. Shit, I'm lucky if I can remember my own goddamn birthday. I mean, they're my family, and I love them, but I'll never really belong the way Jack and Anna do. I swear, sometimes I think I'm adopted." Anna, 27, said she has felt vaguely disconnected from her family since she was a teenager. "Even when I was 14, I knew I was different," Anna said. "Mom and Dad spent way more time with the boys. We'd take family camping trips, and while everyone would be off fishing together, I'd hang back at the campsite and do something creative by myself. And now that I make my living as an independent jewelry designer, that just confirms their suspicions about me being some artsy, loner weirdo." Anna also feels that her status as a single woman in her late 20s has increased her marginalization. "I'm happily unmarried, and that really blows my parents' minds," Anna said. "Tim is getting married in October, and it's okay for Jack not to be married, because he's a guy, and he's only 21. But not me. Mom thinks I should have a husband and a bunch of screaming babies at my feet. I'm sorry, but if not wanting that puts me on the outside, so be it." Told of her children's feelings, Martha Klessig expressed confusion. "I'm not sure why they feel that way, " Martha said. "We don't have a judgment scale for our offspring. They're all our children, and we love each of them equally. It's not like my family growing up: I stuck out like a sore thumb because I read poetry and dropped out of college while my brothers got business degrees."

JazzFest Performer Recognizes Audience From Last Year
INDIANAPOLIS — Twenty minutes into his set at Sunday's JVC JazzFest, jazz guitarist Lee Ritenour recognized the entire audience from last year's event. "There's that one gray-haired guy with the ponytail and the Rippingtons T-shirt," Ritenour said to himself while playing. "And the fat guy who sits on a stack of old issues of Down Beat, just nodding his head. And there's that frizzy-haired lady with the Playboy JazzFest blanket who comes with her son. My, he's grown. " After a rousing ovation at the end of his set, Ritenour thanked the crowd and said, "See you all next year.

Family Upgrades To Shells & Cheese
MOBILE, AL — After years of eating regular Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, the Conroy family upgraded Monday to the higher-end Velveeta Shells & Cheese.

Gay Man, Unattractive Woman Form Tight Bond
GULFPORT, MS — Heavy-set, frumpily dressed Debbie Ayler and openly gay Curtis Gwinn are the best of friends, the pair reported Monday. "Curtis is so fun," said Ayler, 25, talking about her boyfriend-substitute as the two sat at a coffee shop. "We met each other and instantly clicked. Now, we do everything together: shopping, movies, coffee. I even took him to my parents' house for Christmas last year. Continued Ayler: "I told Mom and Dad, 'Don't get any ideas — Curtis and I are just friends,' but I don't think they believed me. Well, I guess if it makes them happy, let them think what they want. Gwinn also speaks highly of Ayler. "It's so great to have someone to lean on, someone you know will always be there for you," said Gwinn, 27. "I can call her any time, even in the middle of the night, and she's there to listen. Ayler met Gwinn in January 2001, when the two were assigned as temps at the same law firm. Ayler soon began spending less time with her old group of friends, even occasionally skipping their weekly "girls' night out" at a local Chi-Chi's. "I like my friends, but when I met Curtis, suddenly it was, like, I can relate to this person on a much deeper level, you know? " Ayler said. "We just connected. Plus, I can tell him anything. He is absolutely unshockable. Gwinn instantly took to Ayler, as well. "Debbie is just so crazy," Gwinn said. "I love that girl to pieces. The moment we met, I said, 'Uh oh, we are going to be one dangerous team.' In spite of Ayler's difficulties finding dates and her insecurity over her looks, Gwinn said she "has got it going on. "Debbie is bootylicious," Gwinn said. "Just look at her. She should be Miss America. Some women are skinny as a stick, but Debbie has got curves. Look out! Neither Gwinn nor Ayler has had much luck in the romantic department of late — a situation over which the pair has bonded. "I've mostly given up," said Ayler, who has never had a real boyfriend but regularly shares with Gwinn the crushes she has on coworkers. "As for Curtis, he just can't seem to find the right person. Most men are such assholes. We both agree on that. "I admit, I had a little crush on Curtis when we first met," Ayler continued. "But then I found out he was gay. You know what they say about all good men: They're either gay or married. Though Gwinn is often chastised for his sexual orientation, his homosexuality posed no problems for Ayler. "People can be so closed-minded about homosexuality, especially here in the South," Ayler said. "But I am totally fine with it. In fact, I read somewhere that 90 percent of people are bisexual. I wonder if Curtis is actually bisexual. Maybe that's why he hasn't found anyone yet. While "out" to his friends and family, Gwinn said that many people mistakenly assume he and Ayler are dating. "It's so funny," Gwinn said. "We were at a diner last week, and this old woman says to Debbie, 'Your husband forgot his coat.' So Debbie says, 'We're not married,' and the woman lowers her voice to a whisper and says, 'My daughter is living with someone, too.' It was sooo funny! "They're always giving each other these little looks that only they understand," said Karen Bilblach, a longtime friend of Ayler's. "At first, I thought something was going on between them, like secret sex, but Debbie assured me there's nothing like that. It's like they're playing house or something. Despite the platonic nature of their relationship, Ayler and Gwinn are physically demonstrative toward one another, with Ayler often stroking Gwinn's hair or leaning her head on him as they watch movies. Gwinn said he is perfectly comfortable undressing in front of Ayler and often does "fashion shows" for her in his living room, trying on newly purchased outfits to solicit her opinion. Ayler said that having a gay best friend has "opened [her] eyes to a whole new world. " Once oblivious to gay culture, she now spends much of her time discussing skin care or the latest hit Broadway musical with Gwinn. She has even begun frequenting gay bars with him. "There's this place in the neighborhood called The Crowbar that we've been going to lately," Ayler said. "We have the best time there, dancing and checking out all the guys. Sometimes, we'll just sit at a table with a pitcher of beer and rate all the guys' buns as they walk past. It's so hilarious! "The nicest part, though, is that they totally accept me there," Ayler added. "You'd think they'd have a problem with it, me being a 'breeder' and all. But they totally don't. It's ironic, but I actually feel more accepted when I'm with Curtis at a place like that than when I'm with straight people. According to psychiatrist Dr. Angela Paschal, Gwinn and Ayler's relationship makes perfect sense. "For Debbie, Curtis is an ideal partner," Paschal said. "He provides friendship, emotional support, and a certain sense of exoticism via his homosexuality. And since she is long-accustomed to not having sex, she barely even misses that component in her quasi-romance. As for Curtis, he receives from Debbie social respectability, unconditional acceptance, and a major ego boost via her obvious but unspoken crush on him. Best of all, he doesn't have to feel the tiniest bit guilty or uncomfortable about her attraction to him because the relationship can never be consummated, thanks to his homosexuality. Curtis and Debbie enjoy a symbiotic relationship of the highest, most dysfunctional order.

BETHEL PARK, PA — Local resident Randy Paltz's two-year home-brewing phase finally came to its long-overdue conclusion Tuesday. "Thank God, it's over at last," said Andrea Longo, girlfriend of the 33-year-old beer aficionado. "Every few weeks, he'd make a big production about his latest 'Paltz's Signature Brew.'

Area Man Criticizes Hazelnut Coffee, Volvos, New Mexico's Flag In Two-Minute Span
ST. PAUL, MN — In a span of two minutes Monday, 33-year-old St. Paul resident Daniel Devore managed to criticize hazelnut coffee, Volvos, and the flag of New Mexico. The 120-second rant took place at Caribou Coffee in the presence of longtime friend Meredith Caranza, 31. "Hazelnut?" said Devore as he browsed the establishment's menu. "That's coffee for people that don't like coffee but want to pretend they do. It's like drinking a candy bar. Why not just drink a glass of Nestlé Quik instead? "I remember thinking 'Uh-oh,'" Caranza said. "We hadn't even placed our order yet, and he was already on a roll. Devore's criticism of hazelnut coffee continued for another 35 seconds, at which point he mysteriously transitioned to the subject of Volvos. "You know what I can't stand is Volvos. They're, like, the most selfish car to own, but the people who drive them act like they're being all earth-conscious and socially responsible," Devore said. "What's so responsible about owning some boxy tank that'll fuck up every other car in the accident while you don't get a scratch? Caranza said she was mystified by the Volvo tirade. "I have no idea what brought that on," Caranza said. "I looked out the window, scanned the paper, checked the stuff on the table, and couldn't find a single thing related to Volvos. He was obviously following some bizarre train of thought in his head. Seconds after his Volvo diatribe died down, Devore spotted a store patron with a New Mexico flag on his backpack. He quickly shifted gears to the iron-on patch. "Of all the 50 state flags, that has to be the stupidest one," Devore said. "It's just this bright-yellow field with, like, this bright-red crosshairs target in the middle. I suppose it's fitting, though. Gives all those desert loners and crackpots something to take aim at. Added Devore: "Pretty much all of the state flags are lame. The only decent one is Maryland." Devore has a long history of adopting seemingly arbitrary stances on a wide variety of subjects. In the past, he has taken aim at such diverse targets as Terry And The Pirates creator Milton Caniff, box springs, Stevie Nicks, tip jars, the History Channel, and carbonated water. Prior to Monday, however, Devore had never railed against three subjects in so condensed a period of time. "I've seen him spend 15 minutes talking about how stupid daylight savings time is," Caranza said. "He takes major issue with things most people don't care about enough to think about, much less form an opinion on. But even by his standards, the hazelnut-Volvo-New Mexico-flag thing was pretty remarkable. Despite Devore's penchant for hyper-criticism, his friends still enjoy his company much of the time. "Sometimes, Dan will go on some hilarious 20-minute tirade about how much he hates Bob Costas, and you'll be in stitches," former roommate Ron Bleier said. "Those are the good times. "He's really smart," Bleier continued, "and he'll occasionally have something interesting and illuminating to say on a subject you never really gave much thought. But mostly he just likes bitching.

Area Man Perpetually In Process Of Buying Or Selling Car
MARION, IL — Local resident Don Liman, 49, is almost constantly in the process of buying, selling, or preparing to buy or sell a car, sources reported Monday. "That's Don for you," said Russell Flange, Liman's neighbor. "We always say old Donnie's got a one-car car lot instead of a driveway. There's a Sable wagon for sale in front of his house right now. "It's not easy to find the exact right car," said Liman, whose search for the ideal car is now entering its 13th year. "But with a little hard work and some basic know-how, you can get yourself something great that really lasts. Since beginning his cycle of used-car ownership in 1989, Liman has bought and subsequently sold 11 vehicles, mostly compact or midsize family models. "Sure, you can buy new. But why bother when, if you know what you're doing, you can get a really decent used car for a couple thousand dollars? " said Liman, who has put an average of $1,800 into each of his used-car purchases before ultimately growing dissatisfied and selling the vehicles. "Once you know what to look for, you can usually get what you want for a song. Then you just fix up any little problems the car might have, and you've got a good-as-new used car that'll last you for years. Liman's current car, a 1992 Mercury Sable station wagon, replaced his 1989 Toyota Corolla when he decided he needed "something with a little more road-hugging weight. " Liman is now looking to sell the Sable to purchase a car that's "a little more nimble and with better mileage — not such a road hog. "Take this one, here," said Liman, circling an ad in one of the many pages of used-car classifieds littering his kitchen table. "An '87 Volvo 240 DL for just $1,900 over in Carbondale. Probably some college student who doesn't need it or couldn't be bothered with the upkeep. Popular car, not much fun, weak steering boxes, tend to go through bushings a little too fast. Plus, a lot of Volvos have diesel engines, and diesel fuel is a real hassle to get at the gas station, especially around here. A lot of guys just want to trade them in for something that runs on unleaded. But, let me tell you, no car's perfect. It's probably worth giving this guy a call. Hal Presser, editor of West-End Valu Shopper, said Liman is a familiar face around the office of the sales circular. "Every six months or so, Don will spend a couple consecutive Thursdays in the office when the new ads come in, poring over every one of them," said Presser, who in 1999 purchased a car from Liman, a "squirrely" 1991 Volkswagen Golf that his wife drove for two years before selling it back to Liman last April. "At first, it was kind of strange. But I suppose he's probably gotten to a few cars he wouldn't have otherwise. I guess.

Marine Never Knew What Freedom Was Until He Left The Marines
MADISON, WI — Troy Leffler, who spent four long years living under an oppressive, totalitarian Marine Corps regime, never knew how precious freedom was until he left the Marines, the former Private-First Class (PFC) said Sunday. "The freedom to go wherever you want, do whatever you like, and say whatever you feel is what makes America great," the 22-year-old Leffler told friends at a backyard barbecue Sunday. "And it's something I really learned to appreciate after four godforsaken years in the military. Though he spent the bulk of his 1998-2001 enlistment on U.S. soil, at Camp Pendleton near San Diego, Leffler did not enjoy the freedom of movement taken for granted by many American citizens. "A big part of American liberty is the right to come and go as one pleases," Leffler said. "For four terrible years, that freedom was denied me. Every minute of every day, I was told where to go and what to do. Except for an occasional weekend pass, the Marines made every decision in your life, from when you slept to when you showered to when and what you had to eat. Added Leffler: "I just hope the people at this picnic realize how very fortunate they are to live in a place where they aren't told what to wear or how to walk. According to Leffler, life under Marine rule was psychologically brutal. "It's hard for free Americans to understand this, but from day one of basic training, Sarge tells you how and what to think," he said. "Not only are you expected to surrender your idea of the individual and begin thinking as a member of a group, but they actually regulate your speech. You have to call a wall a bulkhead, a floor a deck, a gun a weapon. You're reprogrammed to think like one of them. Also denied Leffler were such basic rights as freedom of assembly, freedom from search and seizure of any or all items in his footlocker, and the pursuit of happiness. "It's the little things you never think about that I missed most," Leffler said. "Having a beer for lunch. Taking in a ball game whenever I wanted. Getting into a car with a couple of buddies and driving off for a few days with nowhere special to go. Hanging out all afternoon in a bar. You don't realize how much these things mean until the Marines don't let you do them. Leffler said his greatest hope is that his Marine experience will serve as an example to others. "[Leffler] asked to come to our school and speak to the kids about what freedom means and how you don't have any as a member of the armed services," said Madison West High School principal John Posey, who turned down Leffler's recent request to address the student body. "I admire his dedication to his ideals and his desire to pass along some of his life experience, but I think we'll let the kids make up their own minds on this one. That, Leffler said, may be the greatest danger. "That's how they got me," said Leffler, noting that he was barely 18 when he made the decision to enter the Marine Corps. "I guess I really did it to myself in the end, and that's the worst part. We must all vigilantly safeguard our sacred freedoms, lest we squander them on four years of desert marches and shoe polishing.

New Roommate Has Elaborate Theory About How Kenny Rogers Is A Genius
DAYTON, OH — University of Dayton sophomores Mike Maritz and Andrea Haltigan reported Monday that their otherwise normal-seeming new roommate has "this whole theory about how Kenny Rogers is a genius. "So, yesterday, we're moving the living room around to fit in some of Kurt [Schaier]'s stuff," said Maritz, 21. "The two of us are pushing my big CD shelf into the corner, and out of nowhere, Kurt says, 'Kenny Rogers is the most underrated musician alive.' I was like, 'Where did that come from?' According to Maritz, Schaier spent the next 25 minutes elaborating on his bold assertion, discussing Rogers' pre-solo days with The First Edition, his duets with Dottie West, and his 1977-80 "Golden Era." Later that evening, Schaier returned to the subject twice more, once to offer a line-by-line analysis of the lyrics to "Coward Of The County" and once to declare the 1968 First Edition hit "Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)" a "true pop-psychedelic classic. Haltigan and Maritz first met Schaier on March 14 when he responded to a classified ad for the vacant room in their three-bedroom apartment. "We said no to a few applicants, like this guy with these earlobe things and this one creepy engineering guy, but Kurt seemed totally normal," said Haltigan. "He's a poli-sci major, he has a great DVD collection, and he's into painting, which is all cool. Where the Kenny Rogers-is-a-god thing comes from, I have no idea. According to Haltigan, Schaier made no Rogers-related remarks during his first two days in the apartment. "The first 48 hours were fine, but then on day three, completely out of nowhere, the Kenny Rogers floodgates opened wide," Haltigan said. "That's when Kurt told me that Kenny Rogers straddles — actually, the exact phrase was effortlessly straddles — the line between contemporary pop and classic country, yet everyone unfairly dismisses him as a lightweight because he has strong appeal with the easy-listening crowd. Added Haltigan: "He also said Kenny Rogers is 'long overdue for the sort of critical reappraisal that Burt Bacharach has enjoyed of late.' Who says shit like that? While Haltigan and Maritz have nothing against Rogers, they told Schaier they do not consider him to be in the same league as such country legends as Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, and Willie Nelson. Schaier countered that Rogers "transcends the country label," asserting that he is "not so much a country singer as a spiritual descendant of the master songsmiths of Tin Pan Alley and The Brill Building." "Kurt said that if Kenny Rogers wanted to, he could limit himself to just country, but he wants to create accessible music," Maritz said. "Kurt said that's like criticizing a filmmaker for not working in paint on a canvas. Kurt also said… well, Kurt said a lot. In his efforts to demonstrate the breadth and depth of Rogers' music, Schaier cited a partial list of the artists with whom he has worked. "At one point, Kurt practically followed me into the bathroom," Maritz said. "I'm trying take a piss, and he's outside the door saying, 'Dolly Parton, Coolio… Sheena Easton, Ray Parker Jr., Olivia Newton-John… Madonna… The Charlie Daniels Band.'" Discussing Schaier while he was at class Monday, Haltigan and Maritz raised a number of questions about their new roommate: How long has Schaier been a Kenny Rogers fan? Does he actually listen to Kenny Rogers albums, or is his fandom primarily conceptual? Is Kenny Rogers genuinely of great importance to Schaier, or is Schaier merely a hipster contrarian with countless other, similarly irritating pop-culture theories at his disposal? "I've known tons of guys who say shit like, 'Josie & The Pussycats was the best film of 2001,' just to provoke outrage," Maritz said. "But so far with Kurt, it's only been Kenny Rogers, so I'm not sure if he's one of those. Continued Maritz: "Then there are those guys who randomly pull ridiculous shit out of their asses — for example that, um, every Ron Howard film is based on a different Shakespeare play — just to see if they can somehow prove it. Maybe that's his deal. Then again, maybe he's just a normal guy who happens to like really shitty music. Noted psychologist and author Dr. Terrence Paul agreed that it remains too soon to tell. "Mike and Andrea do not yet know enough about Kurt to determine whether his statements are driven by a genuine love of Kenny Rogers, a desire for acceptance, a desire to annoy, or some combination of the three," Paul said. "At this juncture, they still can't be certain to what extent they should dread the upcoming lease year.

Orgy A Logistical Nightmare
CANTON, OH — Despite his excitement about the upcoming sexual free-for-all, first-time orgy organizer Jerry Belsner, 33, admitted Monday that planning the event has been a logistical nightmare. "You have no idea what I've been through the last few weeks," Belsner said. "Everything that could possibly go wrong has. But I'm still determined to make this the best orgy ever. If I live to see it, that is. Belsner said the complications began soon after he started planning the orgy, scheduled for April 26 at his house. "I'm not naïve enough to think orgies just 'happen,' so I started making calls," Belsner said. "I was going to cover all the expenses myself, but when I started factoring in all the stuff we needed — snacks, liquor, handcuffs, condoms, lube, porno videos, anal beads, batteries for the vibrators, a Slip-N-Slide — it became clear that my wallet was going to take a major hit. So now I have to chase down everybody and try to get them to pitch in a little cash. Many of Belsner's headaches have stemmed from the difficulty of having to accommodate the widely varying sexual tastes of the participants. "Randy doesn't want pornos playing because he finds them distracting," Belsner said. "But Phil says he can't get hard without one. So do I have two rooms, one with pornos and one without? And Karen wants hardcore orgy-themed porn while Marc only wants girl-on-girl or softcore. I could have a whole bunch of different rooms, but if you spread everybody out too thin, it'll just wind up being a bunch of separate two- and three-ways instead of one massive fuckfest. Continued Belsner: "I was going to lay a tarp down in one room so people could oil each other up without damaging my rugs. But do I put the tarp in the porn room or the other one? Why does group sex have to be so complicated? One aspect of the orgy Belsner regrets changing is the theme. Originally slated to be a Roman-toga affair, the event was switched to a Mexican theme to indulge Belsner's fetish for naked women in sombreros. "That was stupid of me," he said. "Mexican food isn't really good for an orgy: No one wants to lick salsa off someone's privates. But I'd already spent two nights Photoshopping sombreros onto the nude pictures on the invitation, so I can't back out now. Another complication has been selecting adult toys for the event. "I figured I'd have a few strap-on dildos and some vibrators," Belsner said. "I'd like people to have as much fun as possible, but I only have a handful of silk scarves for light bondage and one vibrating butt plug. Do I ask people to bring their own stuff? I'd rather have guests just show up and fuck, but it'd be nice to have toys to pass around. Maybe I can find a place that rents butterfly fuck-swings, then decorate one like a piñata." Though already "way stressed," Belsner said he expects his anxiety level to increase as the day of the orgy approaches. "I don't know when I'm going to find the time to clean and set everything up," Belsner said. "My boss asked me to go to Columbus for a conference Wednesday. What am I going to tell him, 'Sorry, I have an orgy to prepare'? When this all started, Tony [Rusan] and Nate [Farris] said they'd help, but they haven't done jack shit except get a cheap sex doll that I'm probably going to have to blow up myself. Another growing concern is the male-female ratio. The orgy, Belsner said, currently skews heavily toward men. "Ideally, I wanted two girls for every guy," Belsner said. "As it stands now, it looks like I'll be lucky if I have one girl for every two guys. Of the yes responses, I've got ten men and four women. And two of those four women said they'd only come if the male-female ratio was 50/50, which doesn't look likely. If only two women show up, that's not an orgy, that's a gangbang. Though Belsner has considered taking out a classified ad seeking female orgy participants in his local newspaper's "alternative lifestyles" section, he characterized that as "a last resort. "You just don't know what kind of people an ad will bring," Belsner said. "I'd rather just keep it small and intimate. This is my first orgy, and I'd really like it to be people I know. Or at least friends of friends. I've been asking the guys to bring any willing females along, but I probably shouldn't count on it. Art Schonbrod, noted swinger and author of Think Globally, Swing Locally, said Belsner's frustrations are common among first-time orgy organizers. "Most first-timers are amazed to discover just how much goes into planning an orgy," Schonbrod said. "From the music to the props to the invite list, it can be extremely stressful. But the planner has to remember that, ultimately, all that stuff is peripheral. The most important thing is celebrating the union of friends and acquaintances in a wild night of mass sexual congress. If [Belsner] keeps his perspective and doesn't let all these hassles get to him, he'll have an orgy to remember for years. "I'm sure it'll all work out okay, and that everybody will have a great time," said Belsner, dialing a Mexican restaurant to inquire about catering prices.

Father's Dying Wish A Real Hassle
HARRISON, TN — The last wish of Gerard Sumlin, who died last month at 68, is "a real pain in the ass," his children reported Monday. "On his deathbed, Dad asked us to make sure there were always beautiful lilac bushes on the side of his sister Helen's house," said daughter Monica Torres, 42. "We were all crying and swore we would. But I guess we weren't really thinking about what a huge hassle it would be. Added Torres: "I don't know anything about planting lilacs. What if we do it wrong, and they die? Then we'd have to do the whole thing again next year. Why couldn't he have just asked for us to spread his ashes in his favorite park or something? Sumlin made the request on April 13, upon being admitted to St. Peter's Hospital in Chattanooga after suffering a massive heart attack. His children were only able to spend a few moments with him before he died. "Dad wasn't very lucid because of all the drugs," said son David Sumlin, 39. "At one point, he grabbed my hand and made me promise that Monica and I would plant the lilacs. In the moment, it seemed like a small request, but now that we actually have to follow through on it, that's a whole other story. According to David, Sumlin was once extremely close to his sister Helen. As children, the siblings used to spend a lot of time playing under the family's lilac bush. However, a bitter fight over family finances drove the two apart as young adults, and they never reconciled. "I understand Dad wanting to plant the lilacs as a gesture of peace toward Aunt Helen," Torres said. "It just sucks that David and I have to do all the work. Dad's not going to have to slave outside in the hot sun and get his hands dirty, but he gets to die with a clean conscience. Sounds like a win-win situation for him. At the time of their father's death, David and Monica said they would be "more than happy" to plant the lilacs, but time and reflection on the work involved have changed their stance. "You don't think about those things when your father is on his deathbed, but I don't know if I can afford to throw away an entire Saturday on this," David said. "I've had to work the last three weekends at the office, so my wife isn't exactly thrilled about the idea of me spending my first Saturday off in a month planting flowers for some woman I barely know. Neither David nor Monica has ever had any real contact with Aunt Helen, making the lilac planting, slated for this weekend, an awkward one. "I remember Mom pointed her out at Cousin Henry's funeral 20 years ago," David said. "It's kind of weird, not really knowing this woman at all and then calling her up and saying, 'Your estranged brother is dead; when can we bring over this bush?' Couldn't we just donate money to some charity in Dad's name instead? The request, Monica said, would have been easier to take if the preparations for her father's funeral hadn't already taken up so much of her time. "I had to take three days off from work just to get the funeral arranged," she said. "There was the notice of death for the newspaper, the insurance, picking out a casket, coordinating an after-funeral gathering, getting a church and organist, talking to the Army because Dad's a veteran, and so on. I'm just getting over all the shit I had to do for the funeral, and now I have to deal with this. Dreading the lilac-bush planting, David said he will be happy when his final-request-fulfilling days are over. "Monica and I have already made a pact not to do this to each other on our deathbeds," David said. "It's tough enough losing a loved one without also losing an entire day trying to find a garden center that sells the right kind of lilac bush and then having to haul the damn thing out to some strange woman's house way the hell out in McMinnville. That's not a dying wish, that's a dying chore.

Area Man Not Exactly Sure When To Take Down American Flags
UTICA, NY — After more than four months of proudly displaying American flags on his car, home, and body, 47-year-old computer consultant Jerry Wenger is uncertain when the appropriate time will be to take them down. "It seems like the war in Afghanistan is winding down," said Wenger from his cubicle at Armstrong & Grunau Consulting Monday. "Then again, we still haven't caught bin Laden. Am I supposed to keep [the flags] up until we get him? But what if we never do? "Do I have to wait until all the troops are home? " Wenger continued. "Because that could take years. I'm not trying to be a jerk — I'm just not sure when to consider this whole thing over. Though Wenger has nothing against displaying the American flag, prior to last September, he'd never owned a flag in his life. "Right after the attacks, there was something comforting about joining the rest of America in a display of patriotism," Wenger said. "I'm still fine with having them up, but I'm really not the type of person who would have flags all over the place if there wasn't a war. On Sept. 13, during a shopping excursion to Wal-Mart, Wenger purchased one flag to hang outside his front door, another for his car-radio antenna, and a flag pin for his coat. A full-page insert from The Utica Observer-Dispatch provided another flag, which he placed in his garage-door window. A fifth flag, in his office, was a gift from a coworker. After donating $20 to the Boy Scouts, he received another flag, bringing the total to six. "I'm not sure what to do now that the fervor is winding down," Wenger said. "I just don't think I'm a six-flag sort of guy. Added Wenger: "The one on my car antenna is looking pretty beat up. I think it might be illegal to display a desecrated flag like that. Last Thursday, seeking to gauge public opinion, he asked coworker Jim Bowden when he thought the office should take down the flag hanging by the receptionist's desk. Bowden said it should remain "until the injustice is eradicated around the world and God's peace prevails. "I had no idea what Jim meant, but I guess now is clearly not the time," Wenger said. In lieu of removing all his flags, Wenger said he is considering "gradually scaling back. "The one by my front door should cover my bases at home, so I could take down the one from the window in the garage," Wenger said. "Then again, the garage one is pretty prominent: The neighbors would definitely notice if that one were gone. Wenger said he's had flag-removal impulses as far back as early December, but he has been waiting for one of his neighbors to be the first to take one down. Thus far, no one has. "After the Taliban fell [on Dec. 7], I figured somebody would take something down, so I took a stroll up and down the block to see," Wenger said. "Not a single one was removed. Even the Dutlers, the world's biggest liberals, still had their three up. It's like the whole neighborhood is playing this giant game of flag chicken. Wenger said he worries what others would think if he removed them first. "I don't want to be the first to take one down and look like an ass," Wenger said. "When I put the flags up, I was saying, 'I support America.' If I take them down, some people will probably think I'm saying, 'I no longer support America.'" As the holiday season approached, Wenger hoped to discreetly replace his two exterior flags with Christmas decorations. But as his neighbors' yards filled with red-white-and-blue lights and flag-adorned plastic reindeer, Wenger aborted the plan. With the arrival of New Year's Day, Wenger renewed to his commitment to taking down some of his flags. His resolve faded, however, when the first American was killed in combat on Jan. 4. "After the death of that Green Beret, it seemed like the worst possible time to take down the flag," Wenger said. "Then, last week, just as I was about to try again, that refueling plane crashed in Pakistan. Next chance I get, I'll have to act quickly. Despite his determination to remove the flags, Wenger remains proud of his decision to display Old Glory for so long. "They say Sept. 11 was the current generation's Pearl Harbor, and I believe that," Wenger said. "But World War II ended with an official surrender and peace treaty, so everybody knew exactly when they could take their flags down. I highly doubt this thing's gonna end with President Bush and Mullah Omar signing an armistice on the deck of the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Ah, screw it — I'll just leave the things where they are.

Teen Who Just Discovered Led Zeppelin Starting To Piss Off Friends
GURNEE, IL — Mark Campa, 16, who has listened to and talked about Led Zeppelin almost exclusively since discovering the '70s rock group over the summer, is "really starting to piss off" his friends, sources reported Monday. "I've got nothing against Zep — they're awesome," said James Savich, 16, a longtime friend of Campa's. "But Mark acts like he's the first person ever to really get into them when he's, like, the 59 billionth. Campa was first exposed to the band in June when older brother Bryan returned from college and started playing Led Zeppelin II while lifting weights in the garage. After one listen, Campa was reportedly hooked, buying his own copy and playing it incessantly for weeks. Campa's Led Zeppelin fixation soon manifested itself in myriad ways, with the teen playing only Led Zeppelin in his car, drawing the Led Zeppelin IV runes on his arm, and spending $73 at the Kane County Fair ring toss in an effort to win a Swan Song mirror. According to friends, Campa's newfound love of the band has caused him to behave in a "dicklick" fashion. "Last Saturday night, a bunch of us were driving around cranking the new Slipknot when Mark popped the tape out and started messing with the radio," said Rick Eglund, 17. "I was like, 'Dude, what's your problem?' He said it was time for WLUP's 'Get The Led Out' and that he never missed it. I told him he was gonna miss it that night. Then, he tried to stop me from putting the tape back into my own stereo. I had to pull over and force him to switch seats with Dan [Alberman]." "The stupid thing is, at the time, we were driving Mark home," Eglund continued. "He has all their CDs, so he could've listened to Zep all night if he'd just waited five minutes. I guess he had to prove what a big fan he is. In addition to naming his '91 Prelude the "Honda Of The Holy" and renaming his cat of four years "Bonzo" as an homage to late Led Zeppelin drummer John "Bonzo" Bonham, Campa has irritated friends with his constant barrage of Led Zeppelin trivia. "In the past week alone, I've learned that Keith Moon came up with the band's name, Jimmy Page is in the movie Blowup, and 'All Of My Love' is about Robert Plant's son Karac, who died from a viral infection," Savich said. "And if I hear Mark tell us about the 'mudshark incident' one more time, I'm gonna kill him. Everybody knows Hammer Of The Gods is bullshit, anyway. Campa has also developed a habit of pointing out Led Zeppelin connections to seemingly non-Zeppelin-related items. "I downloaded the Lord Of The Rings trailer and, next thing you know, Mark goes into this whole thing about how 'The Battle Of Evermore' references the book Lord Of The Rings," Alberman said. "I had to re-start the trailer after he was done because no one got to see it. It's getting to the point where you're almost afraid to go to a movie with Mark because John Paul Jones' second cousin might be an extra in it. Added Eglund: "It could be worse, I guess.

Breakup Put Off Until Bioterrorism Scare Is Over
NEW CASTLE, PA — Shaken and needing companionship in this time of national crisis, Jordan Rosling, 26, announced Monday that he has decided to postpone breaking up with longtime girlfriend Allison Ward until the current bioterrorism scare is over. "I've been thinking of calling it off with Allison for a while, but the time just never seemed right," Rosling said. "Now that we might experience another Black Plague, this really isn't the time. I don't want to die alone, pathetic and girlfriendless. Rosling said it simply makes more sense to wait until the Al-Qaeda terrorist network is completely dismantled before ending things with Ward. "It's been almost six months since I started feeling like Allison and I weren't a forever thing," Rosling said. "So what's a few months more? If we capture [Osama] bin Laden, and it's clear that nothing worse than these anthrax letters is going to happen, then I can make some of these life decisions. But as for right now, I have serious fears about how long my life will even last. Despite his urge to end the relationship, Rosling said things are "okay" with Ward. "Why rock the boat? " Rosling asked. "We're at war. I don't want to be watching CNN, freaking out all by myself the next time something major happens. I've been with Allison for four years, and we've had some good times. It would be just plain stupid to break it off now. Rosling, who recently read Germs: Biological Weapons And America's Secret War, said the recent anthrax attacks are "nothing compared with the shit that could happen. "If smallpox is unleashed on the U.S., there'd be millions of deaths," Rosling said. "They stopped immunizing kids for it in 1972, and immunity to smallpox diminishes with time, anyway. If a terrorist successfully spreads smallpox here, one in three people could die. And those odds are too scary to face all on my own. Also contributing to Rosling's reluctance to break up with Ward is the fact that he has few other people to turn to besides her. "Pretty much all of my good friends have spouses or significant others of their own. So if something happened, they'd be with them, not me," Rosling said. "I don't want to die as a third wheel, all covered in weeping sores and rasping out my last breath as some couple wished I would give them some privacy. While his primary fear is bioterrorism, Rosling said he is also nervous about the possibility of a chemical-weapons attack or nuclear strike against America. "Can you imagine sitting there all by yourself, knowing you're going to die from radiation sickness? " Rosling said. "Then there's the added worry of our current recession. What if it turns into something on the level of the Great Depression? That would definitely not be the time to be on the singles scene. Rosling insisted that his decision to put off the breakup is not a selfish one. "Even though I've realized we're just too different for things to work long-term, I really do care deeply about Allison and wish only the best for her," Rosling said. "If she's going to die, I want to be there for her, too. I would feel so guilty if I dumped her in her final days. Though he termed the scenario a "long shot," Rosling said he sometimes fears that Ward will break up with him and find a new boyfriend right before a major bio-attack. "Then the new guy would be with Allison for a whirlwind one-month romance before dying together," Rosling said. "She would be passionately falling in love in a time of doom, living every moment as if it's their last. It might even be that Mark guy she works with. I don't think I could handle that. Rosling said things might be different if there were "women knocking down [his] door," but that is not — and has never been — the case. "I've never exactly been the ultimate ladies' man," Rosling said. "So let's say I break up with Allison, and in three months, the whole world ends. I might not be able to find anyone to have sex with for the rest of my life. That would suck so bad. There are other practical considerations, as well. "If I break up with Allison, I'd probably move to L.A., where I have this good friend who can give me a job," Rosling said. "But the last place you want to be if there's a smallpox outbreak or a nuclear attack is a major city. No, I'd better stay right here in New Castle with Allison." Dr. Sheila Durkin, therapist and author of the bestselling crisis-management guide Calm Down!: Staying Sane In An Insane World, said Rosling's behavior is not surprising. In times of imminent danger, our self-preservation instinct takes over, and we seek out personal bonds that bolster our feelings of security and comfort," Durkin said. "Given the circumstances, it's only natural that Jordan would behave like a spineless, self-centered prick.

Recently Divorced Man Thinks Everyone Else's Relationship Is In Trouble
SCRANTON, PA — Roger Dittman, whose four-year marriage ended in June, is convinced that the romantic relationships of all his friends and acquaintances are "on the rocks. "It's sad to say, but so many people I know are heading down the same path as me," the 31-year-old said Monday. "It's amazing how many dysfunctional relationships there are out there. Dittman, whose divorce from Amy Dittman, 29, became final on June 6, is unusually tuned into the troubles of others. "There's this couple I'm good friends with, Stephanie and Matt, who, on the surface, really seem to have a solid relationship," Dittman said. "They're totally inseparable, which may seem like a good thing, but they rely way too much on each other for their happiness. Wanting to spend the vast majority of your time with one person is not healthy. They're co-dependent instead of inter-dependent." In addition to co-dependence, Dittman cited 15 other "warning signs" that a relationship is in trouble, including stagnation, abrupt change, lack of common interests, over-compatibility, and any marked increase or decrease in sexual activity. Often, Dittman said, relationships are the rockiest when everything seems to be going well. "For my birthday, my husband Barry got me this wonderful, incredibly expensive present: a first-edition copy of A.A. Milne's Winnie-The-Pooh, my favorite book as a kid," said Jackie Peters, Dittman's sister. "I thought it was a beautiful gesture, but when I told Roger, he said Barry must be feeling guilty about something, like maybe an extramarital affair. I told him that was ridiculous, but he just said I was probably in denial. Though many of Dittman's friends are grateful for his honesty and insight, others would prefer that he mind his own business. "If [Roger] starts another sentence with, 'Ever since my divorce…,' I'm going to throttle him," said Joanie Castona, a coworker of Dittman's at Scranton Surgical Supply. "Maybe if he weren't always offering unwanted advice and treating people so patronizingly, Amy might not have left him. Dittman disagreed with Castona's assessment. "Poor Joanie," Dittman said. "She must be lashing out at me because her partner Claudine is straight and afraid to tell her. I knew this might happen to those two. See, even lesbian relationships have their problems. For all his pessimism, Dittman saves his greatest doubts for his ex-wife and her new love interest. "That stockbroker Amy's seeing now, if that isn't a heartbreak waiting to happen, I don't know what is," Dittman said. "With both of them caught up in such busy careers, when will they find the time to be together? Then there are all those expensive dinners and weekend getaways, which can't be good for the wallet: Money squabbles are bound to drive a wedge between them eventually. Such a pity.

Man Has Mixed Feelings About Having Disease Named After Him
CHICOPEE, MA — In the three years since Dominic Quinn was diagnosed with a previously undetected gastrointestinal disorder, he's become a household name. Yet, for all his notoriety, the 44-year-old Chicopee claims adjuster remains ambivalent about being the Quinn behind Quinn's Disease. "I suppose it's an honor," Quinn told reporters Monday. "I mean, how many people get something named after them? Then again, it'd be nice if I could have somehow gotten the notoriety without having to suffer from a disease. Quinn's Disease, believed to afflict one in every two million Americans, is a non-fatal genetic disorder that impairs the parts of the brain that control alimentary and digestive functions. Symptoms include severe gastrointestinal distress, esophageal inflammation, and constipation and gaseousness. In certain cases, a narrowing of the colon and extreme impacting of the bowels can result, with the pressure becoming so great that a violent hemorrhage of blood and fecal matter occurs. Quinn's ailment makes it necessary for him to submit to round-the-clock medical surveillance and a grueling regimen of thrice-daily enemas and anti-constipation drugs. In addition, since his March 1999 diagnosis, Quinn has undergone 11 operations to clear his large intestine of densely packed, highly toxic waste matter. Given the choice, Quinn would prefer to derive fame from other aspects of his life, such as being a devoted father and husband and a skilled potter. Quinn is particularly proud of having spearheaded a 1987 effort to preserve and restore an 18th-century farmhouse near his home that was slated for demolition. But the public seems unanimous in its opinion that none of these accomplishments are as noteworthy as the colon-obstructing disease that bears his name. "I heard that Lou Gehrig had a problem with ALS being named after him," Quinn said. "He was always telling his wife, 'You know, I was a completely disease-free pro ballplayer for more than a decade before I started to show even the slightest symptoms.' Boy, can I relate. Except, at least Lou Gehrig's Disease is also referred to as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. They've never even given my condition a scientific name. It's just Quinn's Disease, and that's it. Continued Quinn: "Sometimes, I wish I'd contracted a syndrome instead of a disease. Syndromes are often given descriptive names like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. I begged the doctors to reclassify my disease as a syndrome and call it, say, 'Anal-Blockage Syndrome,' but he refused because, technically, a syndrome is defined as a group of various symptoms that culminate in an abnormality. Mine is not an abnormality: I just can't shit properly. Nevertheless, Quinn remains hopeful that, by giving the disease a human face, he has helped raise awareness of Quinn's Disease, increasing the likelihood of a cure. "If my pioneering example can help one day eradicate this terrible disease, it will have all been worth it," Quinn said. "But until that day comes, I'm just Nicky Quinn, the exploding-feces guy.

Garage Band Actually Believes There Is A 'Terre Haute Sound'
TERRE HAUTE, IN–The members of The Weebles, a local garage band formed in 1998, actually believe there is something called the "Terre Haute Sound," sources reported Monday. "It's great," said Weebles bassist Gary Gaspart, 22, speaking from the band's practice space in guitarist/vocalist Jonah Thompson's parents' garage. "The scene is so supportive. It's all about helping each other out, going to the other bands' shows. We're really building on the Terre Haute Sound in ways that are going to blow it up, and I mean wide. The Terre Haute Sound is described by Gaspart as "a bit of NOFX, some revved-up psychobilly country a la Reverend Horton Heat or The Supersuckers, and some analog synthesizer thrown in just to keep it fresh. " He emphasized that the definition is by no means binding, and that virtually anyone who chooses to become part of the Terre Haute Sound is welcome. "We've got all sorts of bands in the THS," Gaspart said. "There's Cutie, who are sort of a psychedelicized version of Op Ivy with a hint of Cheap Trick-style power-pop thrown in. Then there's Spongebob Fuxx, which does grindcore ballads. And you can't forget The Vagina Splits, who are like Bratmobile but with more attitude. The Splits may be girls, but they rock harder than most of the guy bands around. "Not that there's anything wrong with the guy bands here," Gaspart added. "It's all about scene unity. Asked which local bands would not be considered part of the Terre Haute Sound, Thompson struggled to come up with one. "Bottom line, we all just like to rock," Thompson said. "I think that's what sets Terre Haute apart from the Danvilles and West Lafayettes of the world. That and the fact that a lot of us have the same drummer. According to Thompson, though the Terre Haute Sound is the product of many musical influences, one particular band casts the longest shadow. "No question, the Terre Haute Sound wouldn't even exist without The Larry Byrds," Thompson said. "They were the first on the scene, and in my mind, they'll always be the best. "Fuck, yeah," agreed Weebles, Spongebob Fuxx, and Introversion drummer Dave Murn, 23. "Back in '92, when I was in eighth grade, I saw The Larry Byrds play an all-ages show at the Elks Lodge, and they completely blew me away. Those guys paved the way for all the Terre Haute bands to come. Without them, there is no Weebles." The Larry Byrds, a trio of Indiana State University students, broke up in September 1994 when lead singer Elliott Greene moved to Berkeley, CA, to attend graduate school. Copies of the band's sole release, the out-of-print 1993 split single "Tempest In A Teacup," backed by The Draincloggers' cover of Mr. Mister's "Kyrie," has fetched up to $2.99 in cutout bins of Terre Haute-area record stores. In the years since, the recorded output of Terre Haute Sound bands has been limited to three releases. Two have been compilation CDs, 1997's Terror Haute and 1999's Return Of Terror Haute: A Tribute To The Larry Byrds. The third, a 2000 eponymous release by Cutie, was printed in a limited run of 3,200 copies. All three albums were issued by Terror Haute, the local label run by Gaspart. "There's just so much talent in this town," Gaspart said. "A few weeks ago, The Weebles and a few other Terror Haute bands went down to Evansville to do a label-showcase gig. Tons of people were coming up to us after the show, saying how amazing all of us Terre Haute bands were. They were totally going off about how distinctive and cool our sound was. This one guy said that, anyway.

Husband, Wife Have Conflicting Ideas About What Constitutes Healthy Sex Life
KNOXVILLE, TN — Craig and Lisa Livorno, Knoxville residents who have been married for nine years, possess different ideas about what constitutes a healthy sex life. "After almost 10 years together, we still make time for romance," said Lisa, who often equates cuddling and kissing with sex. "Barely a day goes by when we don't get a little intimate. "My parents were so cold and stiff," Lisa continued. "Their sex life was practically nonexistent. Craig and I are the exact opposite. It's always, 'I love you, honey… Give me a goodbye kiss!' While Craig enjoys hugging Lisa and telling her that he loves her, he equates a healthy sex life with frequent sexual intercourse. The couple, on average, has sex once a week, which is not enough for Craig. "Lisa and I are both to blame," said Craig, who is under the mistaken impression that his wife would also like to have sex more often. "You get caught up in your life and, before you know it, you can't even remember the last time you had sex. We both need to make more time. Lisa and Craig agree that they should be more adventurous in the bedroom. Each, however, assumes that the other defines "adventure" the same way. "I'd love to push things a little further, like experiment with leather restraints and maybe even try some anal sex," Craig said. "I'd definitely be into that. Lisa is also eager to push the envelope, having recently read a Cosmopolitan article titled "25 Sizzling Sex Tips To Keep Your Husband Begging For More" that suggests candles, silk sheets, and flavored condoms. "It says, 'A woman should not be afraid to wear sexy lingerie, talk dirty sometimes, or give her man a full body massage,'" said Lisa, reading aloud from the article while giggling nervously. "Some of the suggestions are a little out there, but a lot of it is very — how shall I say it? — intriguing. Lisa said she believes that openness and honesty are crucial to enjoying a healthy sex life. "So many other couples are afraid to talk about sex, but not us," Lisa said. "For example, I can say, 'George Clooney is so hot!' and Craig is totally fine with it. In the spirit of kinkiness, Lisa said she encourages Craig to tell her his wildest fantasies and vice versa. "I love it when Craig tells me about the crazy stuff he'd like to do," Lisa said. "It really turns me on. Once, he called me from work and said, 'I'd love for you to come by my office on your lunch break so we can do it on my desk.' I thought that was so sexy of him to say that! He loves telling me forbidden stuff like that — things we'd never actually do. Craig, on the other hand, would like to act on some of his fantasies, a desire he erroneously assumed was implicit in telling Lisa about them. "It would be cool, if the circumstances were right, to get together with another couple," Craig recently told Lisa. "Since we're so happy and secure, I thought a little 'swinging' might be good for us. " Oblivious to her husband's seriousness, Lisa replied, "Ooh, that would be so wild! "Sometimes, I think about renting a dirty movie," Lisa said. "You know, like an actual porno. I'm sure Craig has those kinds of filthy thoughts, too. We both like to do new things. It's what keeps a marriage interesting. Like his wife, Craig is interested in renting pornography. Unlike his wife, however, he is also interested in videotaping themselves having sex; having Lisa "forget" to wear underwear under her skirt when they go out to dinner; penetrating Lisa doggy-style while she wears a French-maid outfit; receiving fellatio from her in an alley; having intercourse in a restaurant, movie theater, or public library; watching Lisa secretly seduce a male stranger in a bar and invite him back to a hotel room on the condition that her husband can watch; and inviting Allison, the couple's sexy 23-year-old neighbor, over for coffee, only to find out that she works as a stripper and would like to have some feedback on her act and could use a little help from Lisa getting her bra undone.

Longtime Sexual Fantasy Awkwardly Fulfilled
LEXINGTON, KY–The longtime sexual fantasy of Andrew Marcone was awkwardly fulfilled Saturday, when the local record-store clerk participated in a clumsy, embarrassing menage a trois with girlfriend Karen Wagner and her roommate Shelley Peelen. "Well, I finally did it, for what it's worth," said Marcone, 27, following the long-dreamed-of sexual encounter, six minutes into which he ejaculated. "So much for wondering what it would be like, I guess. " After achieving orgasm, Marcone spent the next half hour "trying not to get in the way" of his companions.

Nation In Love With Girl From Record Store
ATHENS, GA–Captivated by her adorability and off-the-charts hipness, the U.S. populace sheepishly admitted a deep infatuation with 22-year-old Danielle Metzler, that amazing girl with the multi-colored hair who works at Slipped Discs in Athens. "God, she is so fucking unbelievably cute," Sam Kiefer of Euclid, OH, said Monday. "The last time she was wearing these super-tight silver pants and this rhinestone-studded New York Dolls half-shirt, and I was just like, 'Wow.'" Metzler was first spotted at Slipped Discs, an independently owned store stocked with a wide selection of indie rock, hip-hop, electronica, and otherwise hard-to-find music, in September 1999. Ever since, the nation has had a major crush on the girl. "[Metzler] works at the coolest record store in Athens, and she's totally up on all the latest stuff," said Ryan Griggs, 48, a television repairman from Salem, OR. "You have no idea how many people go in there every day and buy some obscure Go-Betweens B-sides collection or the latest Stephin Merritt side project just to try to impress her. Griggs recently purchased Toby Dammit's vinyl-only Gopher Edits EP–a highly successful move which prompted Metzler to ask about the record. "I couldn't believe it," Griggs said. "For 45 glorious seconds, it was just me and her talking about bands like Tipsy and Jazzanova." Residents of the Florida panhandle admitted that their own attempts to impress Metzler were less successful. "I heard her talking to someone about these great new Boredoms remixes, so I bought the one by U.N.K.L.E.," Pensacola's Andy Nichols said. "I don't even own a single original Boredoms album, but I now have an import remix I paid $30 for. Continued Nichols: "When she was ringing up the U.N.K.L.E. thing, I said, 'These are supposed to be really good.' So she says, 'Yeah, but if you're not going to get them all, the DJ Krush is really the one to go with.' I was like, oh, great. But then she gave me this really big smile, and it was all worth it. Upon discovering they were not the only ones with a long-standing crush on Metzler, residents of the Midwest came forward with their own tales of longing for the girl, sharing everything from the time she wore that really tight Le Tigre T-shirt to the time she danced to Cheap Trick's "Southern Girls" as it played on the store's stereo. "Once, she was reaching up to grab a CD for a customer, and I noticed maybe half an inch of leopard-print underwear peeking out of the back of her hip-huggers," said Carl Mills, a Beloit, WI, truck driver. "That was a year ago, and I still remember it. Josh Starkes of Boise, ID, is among the few Americans who know the girl's name. "I was hanging around the store one afternoon, and I heard one of her coworkers say, 'Hey, Dani, could you grab me a few of the new Dirty Three/Low from the back?' " Starkes recalled. "Turns out, her name is Danielle, but she goes by 'Dani,' and sometimes even 'Dan.' On the employee-suggestion rack, it says, 'Dan's Pick Of The Week.' I mean, how cool is that? According to millions of Americans, unlike many of the other clerks at Slipped Discs, Metzler never asks if you need help finding anything. Even if you make it obvious that you are struggling to find a particular record, she will remain by the front counter, talking and laughing with a select crowd of visitors. "I was in there, and I recognized this one guy talking to her as the lead singer from [Athens band] Corky Thatcher," said Dave Douglas of Riverside, CA. "I can never figure out if all these people hanging out are her actual friends or just people she's deemed cool enough to talk to her. And, if the latter is the case, how do I become one of those people? Oh, who am I kidding? I don't stand a chance. Despite such insecurities, the people of Southern California say the mixture of desire and insecurity associated with a trip to Slipped Discs is "exhilarating." "I wanted to get the first Modern Lovers album, but I didn't want her to know I didn't already own it," said Jody Osbourne of San Diego. "To cover up, I told her some big, long story about how my friend is such a jerk because he borrowed it a long time ago and never gave it back. When I was done with this four-minute spiel, she just said, 'I hate Jonathan Richman.' I wanted to curl up in a ball and die. While it's unknown whether Metzler has a boyfriend, the American people have always assumed she does. "Whenever I see her out at a show, she's always surrounded by this pack of slim-hipped, good-looking hipster guys," said Jesse Avery of Roseville, MI. "She's never hanging on any one in particular, but one of them has got to be her boyfriend. The nation has no plans to try to advance its relationship with Metzler beyond that of customer and clerk, saying it prefers to worship her from afar. "She's way out of my league, and even if I could get her to like me–which I couldn't–it would only cause problems," said Earl Shaw, 36, a Gulfport, MS, actuary. "When a girl has so many guys fawning over her, she's bound to want her way with everything. Continued Shaw: "That is, unless she was sick of all the rock 'n' roll assholes she dates and was ready for someone who doesn't fit into that mold. Maybe she is. Maybe she's looking for someone a little smarter than those guys–someone like me. Shaw added that maybe he could even learn to play bass guitar. Informed of the nation's crush, Metzler shrugged her shoulders. "That's cool," she said, "but lately I've been more into British guys. " She then returned to sorting CDs.

Guests Forced To Pretend Wedding A Good Thing
MINOT, ND–Suppressing their feelings about the doomed couple, guests at Saturday's wedding of Jerome Sykes, 23, and Madeline Pirone, 26, pretended the marriage was a good thing. "Madeline looked so beautiful today," said mother of the groom Betsy Sykes, who once threatened to disown her son if he married "that manipulative bitch. " "She looked positively radiant. They're going to give me such beautiful grandchildren one day. Willfully ignoring the eight months of screaming, pleading, and threats that marked the couple's courtship, both families were outwardly positive about what they secretly called a "horrible disaster waiting to happen. "Jerome and Madeline said they were in love and wanted to spend the rest of their lives together," said Dorothy Pirone, the bride's mother, who reacted to the October 2000 announcement of the engagement by throwing a porcelain cookie jar at Sykes' head. "It's so wonderful to see a young couple so in love. Despite near-constant fighting and two breakups during their eight months of dating, Sykes, a part-time worker at Federal Express, and Pirone, a hair stylist at Supercuts, say their relationship was meant to be. "Nobody in my family liked me going out with Maddy," Sykes said. "Everyone said she wasn't good enough for me, that she treats me like shit. But I don't care what they say: She's the love of my life and nobody can keep us apart. Pirone agreed, saying that their families' disapproval of the relationship brought her and Sykes closer together. "Everyone in Jerry's family said I was just dating him on the rebound after I broke up with Mike [Harrison]," said Pirone, straightening the same wedding gown worn years earlier by her mother, who reluctantly agreed to let Madeline wear it. "So we felt like we had to see each other in secret, just like in that movie Romeo And Juliet, until Jerry was just like, 'Screw this, let's just get married and nobody will be able to tell us what to do.' Friends of the bride and groom masked their true feelings throughout the reception, peppering their conversation with comments like, "Yes, we're very happy for the both of them," and "No, really, we're very happy. "When Jerome's high-school shop teacher, Mr. Kyzlowski, came through the receiving line, he said it looked like Jerome had really grown up in the last few years," said Patricia Sykes, the groom's mother. "And I guess I had to agree–he technically is a man now. Pirone's maternal grandmother, Mary Ellen O'Rourke, who after every meeting with Sykes said she "[doesn't] like that boy," was especially impressed with the wedding. "The flowers were so beautiful," O'Rourke said. "Very pretty flowers. "I told Madeline I was totally jealous of her," said maid of honor Roxanne David, who in March repeatedly warned Pirone that Sykes was sleeping with one of their friends. "I told her she looked so beautiful, and that Jerry is going to make her the happiest woman on the planet. What else was I supposed to say? Not everyone paid lip service to the couple's prospects. "If those two last more than a year, I'll sell my dentures," said Maria Van Kamp, 58, the harpist at the reception. "I've played a lot of weddings, and I can usually tell who's going to make it. Usually, if the groom is drunk and hitting on a bridesmaid, and the bride threatens to call off the wedding twice during the rehearsal dinner, it's a pretty good sign that they're not going the distance. Added Van Kamp: "They make a cute couple, though.

Eldercare Residents Long For Agonizing 'Funtime' To End
MIDDLESEX, CT — Staring at the rec-room clock Monday, Herman Oster and 23 of his fellow Eldercare Nursing Home residents waited for the day's agonizing "Funtime" to finally end. "Not too much longer now," said Oster, 83, midway through the two-hour descent into tedium. "After we throw the big ball back and forth, there's usually one more song, and then it's over at last. Listed on the Eldercare Events Calendar as "Funtime with Judy," the weekly event is hosted by Judy Lyon, one of Eldercare's two recreational therapists. "On other days, we have scheduled events like bingo or bridge or movie time," the 34-year-old Lyon said. "But on Tuesdays, I like to mix it up a little and surprise the residents. During Funtime, anything goes! Previous Funtime activities have included leatherworking, macrame, and waving brightly colored flags. "I always plan something that involves everyone," said Lyon, who in 1995 received her master's degree in recreational therapy from Central Connecticut State University. "I try to provide the residents with socialization opportunities that will also improve motor function, increase relaxation, and build awareness skills. According to Oster, the most painful Funtime activity is "Remember When?," in which Lyon asks residents questions about their lives before entering the nursing home. "Sometimes, Judy asks us to talk about our kids, and that always hurts, because I hardly ever see them," Oster said. "I really don't like talking about it in front of the group. John Edwards, 91, is similarly uncomfortable with "Remember When?" "One time, Judy asked me what my first car was," Edwards said. "I had no idea. I just couldn't remember. I was so embarrassed. Despite the depressing, non-fun nature of Funtime, many residents still feel compelled to attend. "Whenever I see Judy in the hall, she asks if I'm going to Funtime this week," said Doris Heckel, 80. "She's so smiley, I feel bad saying no. "If I don't go, Judy always asks me where I was," Heckel continued. "I can get away with skipping every third time or so, but if I miss two in a row, she really lets me have it. Some residents said they attend because of the availability of food and beverages. "The meals here are worse than the K-rations I had to choke down during the Big One, but they make up for it during Funtime by rolling out cake and coffee," said Sam Cropper, 84. "A nice piece of chocolate bundt helps ease the pain of Judy's interminable sing-alongs." Cropper, who spends most days in his room reading the newspaper and writing letters to long-deceased friends, said he appreciates the attention paid to residents by Lyon, despite the unbearable nature of the activities she plans. "Most of us are still adjusting to not being able to get around like we used to, so it can get pretty lonely here at Eldercare," Cropper said. "It's nice to have someone to talk to, even if it's about something dumb like what kind of flower we'd like to be. Added Cropper: "There are many things I'd like to see and do, but since my stroke, I just haven't had the energy. Max [Franklin] has been the same way ever since he broke his hip. I guess fear of loneliness is what drives most of us to endure the distraction of Funtime."

Tenants Feel Guilty Asking Elderly Maintenance Man To Fix Anything
BOSTON–Tenants in the apartment building at 437 Market St. reported Monday that they experience a gnawing feeling of guilt every time they ask Hank Hudson, the 82-year-old maintenance man, to repair anything.

New Parents Desperately Seeking Other New Parents For Socializing
BETHESDA, MD–New parents David and Diane Huber, both 28, remain locked in a desperate search for other parents with whom they can talk exclusively about children, child-rearing, and their beautiful eight-month-old son Tyler, sources said Monday. Despite a few tentative signs of progress–including the discovery of a new-parent Internet bulletin board, a brief conversation with a new father in their pediatrician's waiting room, and a possible get-together with Marc and Allison Wofford, new parents they met through their pastor's aunt–the Hubers' quest has been slow going. "I really liked Rob and Kim, didn't you? " Diane asked David, referring to a couple the Hubers cornered near the swingsets at a Bethesda-area park upon spotting them with a stroller. Absent-mindedly musing as she folded tiny pieces of cloth, Diane added, "We really should get together with them sometime. It seems like we have a lot in common. " Diane knows nothing about the couple that is not baby-related. "We should all go out to dinner," David replied. "Although, maybe it would be easier just to have them over to the house for dinner, because I'm still not all that comfortable with the whole babysitter thing. David and Diane then concluded that it would be great if the other couple, whose last name they failed to obtain, brought over their baby, too. Friends and neighbors see no end in sight for the Hubers' quest, which has produced few viable candidates for new-parent socializing due to the lack of other new parents in their extended social circle. "David used to go bowling every Sunday night with the league at Bumper's Bar and Grill," said onetime friend Carl Henkins. "We always got along real well because we both like boats. Plus, I'm a big Philadelphia Eagles fan, and David went to college in Philly. But now, the few times he comes down to bowl, it's always, 'When Tyler was born, he weighed almost as much as this bowling ball,' or, 'Speaking of shoe rental, you should see the booties we bought Tyler last week' or some other such nonsense. "I mean, come on, I've got a five-year-old girl myself," Henkins said. "But that doesn't mean I can't keep my bowling life and my family life separate. The primary cause of the Hubers' inability to relate to their former friends, David said, lies in their friends' unwillingness to talk exclusively about parenting. "Ever since the baby arrived, my old buddies have been acting really weird around me," said David, warming a bottle of formula. "Like, just the other day, I met Jason [Niering] for a game of racquetball, which I hardly ever have time for anymore. When I got there, I started telling him how Tyler had been lying on his back that morning, grabbing his ankles and swinging his legs up over his head, and how it was noteworthy because neither Diane nor I had ever seen him do that particular move before. After pausing for approximately four minutes to remove a messy diaper, clean Tyler's soiled backside, find a Wet-Nap, apply lotion, put on a fresh diaper, and return to warming the now-cold bottle, Huber continued: "So, anyway, I'm not more than four or five minutes into the story when all of a sudden, Jason says, 'What does this have to do with anything? Will you serve, already?' Totally out of the blue. I mean, what provoked that outburst? Henkins and Niering are not the only friends from whom Huber has "grown apart. "Me and Tony [Lake] used to hang out all the time because we were both into cars," Huber said. "Now it's just not the same. Every time we get together, it seems like all he ever talks about is cars. Diane has noticed an increased distance from her old friends, as well. Over the past several months, she has frequently remarked that none of them seem to share her interests anymore. The lack of conversation with others her own age, Diane said, has made her feel lonely at times. "What with all the work I have to do taking care of Tyler, I'd sure like to spend some time with other adults every now and again," Diane recently told her mother, in between anecdotes about Tyler, during a long-distance phone call. "I'm a well-rounded person, and I have lots of interests: like where the best public schools in the area are, when is the right time to introduce pets into the home, what is the best way to set up a college fund, the whole issue of immunizations–you name it. As pathetic and self-deluding as it may seem, the Hubers' plight, experts say, is actually quite common. "It is not unusual for the parents of a new baby to feel terrible isolation, as the demands of parenting force them to spend less and less time with friends," said noted family therapist Dr. Eli Wasserbaum. "Yet it is possible to cope with these changes. All the Hubers need is to find someone–pretty much anyone with a pulse, really–they can spend a little time with away from the baby, yet with whom they can talk about nothing but the baby for hours on end, without making the other person feel like tearing his or her hair out and screaming. That's all.

Mockingbird Imitates Car Alarm Perfectly
HOUSTON–In an unsettling development for the natural world, a mockingbird was heard perfectly mimicking a car alarm Monday. "I heard this strange song coming from a mockingbird in a big spruce across the street from St. Luke's Hospital," bird watcher Bob Ausmus said. "After a minute or two, I realized it was one of those multi-sound car alarms–he did the staccato one, the slowly rising one, the buzzing one. He must have picked it up from one of the BMWs in the parking lot. " Ornithologists predict that the alarm song will spread to millions of birds and be handed down for centuries to come.

As a gay man, whenever I'm in a new city, the first thing I do is seek out the gay district. Whether it's New York's Greenwich Village, The Castro in San Francisco, or Chicago's Boystown, a gay district has the stores, cafés, and clubs that fit my lifestyle. But I've been here in Moline for two whole days on business and, God help me, I can't find the Moline gay district anywhere. I just don't get it. I've driven all over town with no luck at all. Where are the gay bars? The vintage-clothing shops? The lesbian book stores? I swear, it's like Moline is trying to keep the gay part of town a big secret. You have to be a regular queer Columbo to find a single upscale erotic-art gallery in Moline, much less an entire gay district. My first stop was downtown, which I quickly redubbed Lametown. No vegan restaurants, no scented-candle shops–not so much as a single inverted pink triangle in a window. Only fast-food chains, auto-supply stores, and a Kmart. Can't get much straighter than that. Convinced that I missed something, I scoured the entire downtown area again, this time with my gay-dar turned up a good three notches. Once again, nada. For a second, I thought I saw a rainbow flag, but it was just a sign in the window of a paint store. It was time for drastic measures. I marched into Ray's Feed & Farm and asked if there were any thrift shops, massage parlors, or holistic pet-food stores nearby. Those farmers looked at me like I was balancing a Buick on my dick. After a few moments of awkward silence, one guy in a John Deere cap cleared his throat and directed me to Bridgewood Antiques. I thanked them for their help and got out of the store quickly. I hope I don't ever have any need for feed or farming supplies, because I don't think I'd want to go back in there any time soon. After going through all that trouble, Bridgewood Antiques turned out to be a major bust. All they had were old magazines and Craftsman tools. No Shaker rocking chairs, no Japanese screens, no chintz drapes. What's worse, the customers were all just a bunch of gray-haired old grandmas. Where were the immaculately dressed gay professionals trying to find that perfect, one-of-a-kind floor rug for their sunroom? Where were the flamboyant hipsters buying campy early-'60s kitchen tables? They must be somewhere in Moline, but where? I finally realized where I needed to look: the local college campus. That's always a reliable gay hotbed. I marched right up to the entrance of the Black Hawk College student union and asked a man where I might find any "Friends Of Dorothy." All I got was a blank stare. The next 250 people I approached just offered more of the same. I'm not giving up yet. I know there's a gay district somewhere in Moline. There has to be. I mean, it's a city of more than 40,000 people, for heaven's sake. Ten percent of that works out to 4,000 people. That's heck of a lot of gay people to keep hidden and districtless. This morning, while leaving my hotel, I got a tip from the front-desk clerk. He said there's a drag show on the outskirts of town tonight. Hallelujah! If I can get out there, I should be able to find my kind of folks. I just have to remember the directions to the raceway where it's being held, and I'll be home free. Keep your fingers crossed.

Beauty Of National Forest Enjoyed By Logger
SAWTOOTH NATIONAL FOREST, ID–The rugged natural beauty of Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest was thoroughly enjoyed by logger Steve Orton Monday. "This sure is beautiful country," said Orton, admiring the lush foliage surrounding him in most directions. "Just smell that fresh air. An employee of the Northwestern Logging Company, Orton was dispatched as part of a team of 350 loggers to Sawtooth last Thursday after the company outbid dozens of competitors for a lucrative government contract. "I could never work all cooped up in an office," said Orton, placing his coffee mug on a stump grinder, a three-ton machine used to pulverize tree stumps into sawdust. "I only feel at home when I'm surrounded by nature in all her magnificent splendor. One of the largest national forests in the U.S., the 2.1 million-acre Sawtooth boasts an astonishing variety of terrain, from wildflower-covered meadows to towering mountain peaks. With many areas only accessible by helicopter, Sawtooth is considered one of the most pristine old-growth forests in America. "I've been a logger all my life," Orton said. "I've worked in a lot of areas, but this is definitely one of the most awe-inspiring. It was so beautiful and untouched, it was almost like we were the first people to set foot here. I know that's not true because people used to camp out here, but they cleaned up after themselves so well, you'd never know it. Orton, a self-proclaimed "nature lover and all-around outdoorsman," reported that the first tree they felled was especially impressive. "For some reason, we decided to start with this enormous western hemlock," said Orton, motioning to what is now a 15-foot-wide stump. "During a break, Wally [Dassle] decided to count the rings and there were 160 of them, which means that tree had been here since 1841. Just think about all the history that's happened since that tree was a sapling. In addition to admiring the trees, Orton said he has "a real soft spot" for the local wildlife. "You wouldn't believe how many elk we saw over there," said Orton, pointing to what is now a pockmarked, heavily eroded field. "Every morning, before we started work, one or two would come out of the trees into the clearing to say hello. "Most days, we see animals while we're setting up camp, but after we begin we don't see them anymore," said Orton while filling the gas tank on a professional-grade chainsaw. "I keep forgetting to take a camera with me to snap some shots. For nearly a week, Orton has been working on clearing 1,200 acres of the Sawtooth National Forest, with the lumber to be turned into 2x4s or presswood. "This is an incredible area," said Orton, patting the bark of a Sitka Spruce. "Sometimes, when we're on break and everything's quiet, the rustling of the remaining foliage almost seems to be talking to me. Orton said that even though he and the other loggers are working, they have set aside time for fun. "When we first got out here, we'd fish during our lunch break," Orton said. "Russ [Keely] caught a 30-pound Steelhead, and we all got pretty excited. We haven't been able to fish the last few days, what with the logs and all, but it sure was fun while the river was still clear. With the logging project scheduled for completion March 4, Orton is determined to enjoy his remaining time in the forest. "Russ and I talked about seeing who can scale that huge one over there the fastest," said Orton, pointing to a 100-foot-tall spruce. "We'll have to do it soon, though, because we're taking it out right after lunch tomorrow.

Five Or Six Dudes Jump Out Of Nowhere And Just Start Whaling On This One Guy
BOULDER, CO–Shock and disbelief were the prevailing reactions Monday, when pizza-delivery guy Lyle Kelso, 24, reported to roommates that at around 2 or 3 a.m., he personally witnessed, like, five or six dudes suddenly jump out of freakin' nowhere and just start totally whaling on this one guy. "That is majorly messed-up," roommate "Thatches" Moynihan said. "You hear about that sort of shit on the news, but you never think it's going to happen right in front of somebody you know who'll later come home and totally tell you all about it. When Lyle told us, I was like, 'Whoa, dude. That's harsh.' We all were. It sounded like some seriously wigged-out shit, from what Lyle was saying. According to Moynihan, he and three other roommates were sitting around, just kicking back and watching TV, when Kelso burst into the room and breathlessly announced that "you guys are not gonna fucking believe what the fuck I just saw by the Dumpsters behind Papa Luigi's [Pizza]." After a dramatic pause, the visibly agitated Kelso said, "I just saw some poor fucker completely get his ass beat down by a bunch of seriously pissed-off dudes," prompting responses ranging from "No way, man! " to "Holy shit, dude! According to this one guy who heard the story from a buddy of one of the roommates at a house party the next night, the scene supposedly went down something like this: Toward the end of his shift, Kelso sneaked out to the alleyway between Papa Luigi's and Fat Pete's Subs to fire up a big ol' jay. While smoking up, Kelso heard the sound of squealing tires from the parking lot behind Papa Luigi's. Fearing that it was the cops about to bust his ass, he peered around the corner to check out what the fuck was up. Kelso said he saw a black van, identified only by an airbrushed painting of a barbarian chick on the side and an enormous "Ozzy" sticker in the back window, suddenly pull up from out of nowhere, right next to some dude who was about to get in his car. Without warning, the guy who heard the story from a buddy of one of the roommates said, five or six huge-ass motherfuckers who totally looked like bodybuilders or something jumped out of the van, cornered the unidentified victim, and basically just commenced to whaling on his ass. "I would've tried to help, but there was no way I was messing with those fuckers. Uh-uh, no sir," Kelso reportedly told roommates. "I may have been baked, but I ain't stupid. After several minutes of some seriously painful ass-kicking, the big, mean-looking dudes reportedly hopped back inside the van and bolted as suddenly as they'd appeared. Before Kelso could approach the poor fucker who'd gotten whaled on, the dude limped to his car and bolted, leaving the stunned Kelso standing there wondering what the holy hell had just fucking happened and "feeling like [his] mind was totally friggin' blown. Though the identity of the whaled-upon dude remains unknown, numerous theories exist regarding who the fuck he was. Among the theories are that he was Some Poor Sap Who Never Knew What Hit Him, A Guy Who Just Happened To Be In The Wrong Place At The Way-Wrong Freaking Time, or Somebody Who Obviously Must Have Fucked With The Wrong People. Supporters of each theory, however, agree that, whoever the hell the guy was, he probably ain't exactly having the best day right about now, wherever the hell he is. The attack has raised serious safety and crime-prevention concerns among the roommates. "After that shit Lyle told us he saw, I ain't goin' anywhere without a baseball bat in the car, I'm telling you that right the fuck now," said Matt Mendham, 22. "It's like, do I want to get my ass pounded by a bunch of monster dudes? No, I don't think so. Added Mendham: "It's too bad my friend Chad's brother wasn't there, because he totally knows t'ai chi and shit. Despite the strong reaction to the guy-whaling incident among Kelso roommates and associates, some are questioning the validity of his claims. "Kelso's always making shit up," said Dan Soderlund, a longtime coworker of Kelso's at Papa Luigi's. "He smokes a few bowls, and the next thing you know, it's, 'Dude! The freakiest thing just happened!' It's like, 'Yeah, yeah, keep talking, Lyle.' That guy is so full of it sometimes. Believe me, I've heard it all before, man.

Web-Browser History A Chronicle Of Couple's Unspoken Desires
VALLEJO, CA–The web-browser history on Allen and Christine Pollard's home iMac computer provides a comprehensive chronicle of the couple's deepest frustrations and desires, sources reported Monday. "By simply opening Allen and Christine's Internet Explorer history folder, we find their innermost longings laid bare," said Dr. Terrence Kimble, dean of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley. "From emotionally stunted, sexually frustrated Allen's frequent visits to porn and Camaro sites to childless Christine's frequent visits to baby-clothes sites, it's all right there. According to Kimble, the Pollards' browser history, which logs the 200 most recent hits by users of the computer, "offers a glimpse into an entire universe of unvoiced pain and disappointment. "As the Pollards enter their late 30s, all the dissatisfaction they hide from the world and, in most cases, each other can be easily found under the menu heading 'Go,'" Kimble said. "Because he knows Christine loves living in suburbia, Allen never talks to her about his dream of roughing it in a cabin in the Rockies. He just spends hours surfing the REI and Patagonia sites, filling his virtual shopping cart with lanterns and sleeping bags, then logs out without purchasing anything. "Likewise," Kimble continued, "although Christine tells her friends that she and Allen have decided they aren't ready to have children, her www. babynames.com bookmark tells a different story. The unfulfilled desire to procreate is by no means Christine's only source of unhappiness, Kimble said. "While she maintains a cheery and fun-loving front, it is obvious that Christine has deep-seated self-esteem issues," Kimble said. "She is all but addicted to online quizzes like Redbook's 'Does Your Wardrobe Give Away Your Age?' and Cosmo's 'Are You A Bore In Bed?' With her high-school cheerleading days far behind her, Christine has yet to find a new identity with which she is comfortable. By carefully examining the history log, it's even possible to reconstruct Allen and Christine's respective thought processes. "Let's look at Christine's time online last night," said Kimble, pointing to an opened history folder on the computer screen. "She starts at the Godiva gourmet chocolates online gift catalog at 7:35 p.m. Then it's on to eDiets.com at 7:43 p.m. and the Nordic Track web site at 7:45. I'm guessing she clicked on a banner ad at eDiets to get there. Then it's on to 'Liposuction FAQs' at 7:52. Next is a page titled, 'Sexy Swimwear Sale: Dare To Be Bare.' Then, at 8:06 p.m., it's back to the Godiva chocolates secure-server online order form. Christine admitted she keeps the details of her Internet surfing from her spouse. "I don't mention this to Allen, because he would just say I'm being too self-critical, but I wish my nose weren't so big," Christine said. "I tried some of the de-emphasizing makeup tricks on the Maybelline site, but it's clear that what I really need to do is see a professional. Plasticsurgery.com says the procedure only takes six hours and is totally safe. While Christine's browser history exposes her insecurities about her appearance, Allen's web-surfing patterns reveal his career dissatisfaction. "It's obvious that Allen wants to quit his dead-end job at the bank and become an author," said Kimble, pointing to a list of Allen's web links to iUniverse.com and NextGreatAmericanNovel.com. "An author who works out of his cabin in the mountain, that is. Despite doing so on a daily basis, the Pollards are oblivious to the fact that they pour their innermost frustrations into their blueberry iMac. "We both really enjoy going online," Allen said. "It's just a great way to waste time and have a little fun.

Man Who Thought He'd Lost All Hope Loses Last Additional Bit Of Hope He Didn't Even Know He Still Had
INDIANAPOLIS–Despite assuming that he had lost every last possible ounce of hope long ago, area office-supply coordinator Bob Dempsey, 31, was surprised to discover Monday that he did, in fact, possess one tiny additional shred of hope, which he subsequently lost. "Contrary to the belief of coworkers, neighbors, distant relatives, and Mr. Dempsey himself, this so-called 'hopeless' man actually still had one infinitesimally small shred of hope, which he became aware of in the process of losing said last shred of hope," said noted therapist Dr. Eli Wasserbaum. "Oddly, it was only during that fleeting moment in which he was losing this additional micro-hope that he was able to realize that the hope had ever existed at all. "Unravelling this singular psychological event makes for a tremendous challenge for the trained therapist," said Wasserbaum, who is attempting to reconstruct the basics of the incident, believed to be the least epiphanic moment of self-discovery in the annals of modern medicine. "In fact, some might even say a challenge so daunting as to be hopeless. Dempsey's discovery and subsequent loss of the hope is believed to have begun at approximately 8 a.m. Monday, when he noticed a letter in his mailbox–which he checks every two to three weeks, usually finding nothing–from a German address unfamiliar to him. Unable to open the letter at the time because he was on his way to work, he left it behind to read later. At some point during his workday, which consists primarily of sitting at a desk, staring into space, and occasionally placing a checkmark in boxes next to such words as "staplers" or "paperclips," he realized that the name on the return address was that of an old college friend who had moved to Germany years before and told Dempsey that "maybe you'll hear from me again sometime. "Apparently, though he had long since forgotten about the friend, there remained in Dempsey some residual, subconscious awareness that there was a tiny chance, however microscopically small, that he would one day hear from this person again," Wasserbaum said. "He must have realized this at some point during the day and experienced a slight sensation of excitement, looking forward to going home and reading the letter. Upon returning to his squalid one-room flat that evening, however, Dempsey discovered that the letter was actually a notice from German authorities informing him that the friend had died in a fire and asking assistance in locating his relatives. The only reason Dempsey was sent the letter, sources said, was that his name was the only legible words from a charred college yearbook unearthed in the ash and rubble of the tragic blaze. Prior to Monday, Dempsey had not experienced any loss of hope in more than three years. According to Wasserbaum, a majority of Dempsey's hope-losses hit him in successive ramrod batterings between the ages of 18 and 24. By the time he had reached his late 20s, Dempsey had lost enough of his remaining hope to be considered officially hopeless. Nevertheless, he forged ahead with his few tiny remaining shreds of hope–too insignificant to be considered hope to the average person–until a final devastating blow depleted his hope reserves in February 1997. "There have just been so many times he's lost hope over the years," Wasserbaum said. "There was the night of his senior prom, when his date and then-best friend drunkenly made out in front of dozens of classmates before openly mocking him in a group sing-along along with the rest of the senior class. This is just one of a lifetime of incidents. There was the time his recently discovered biological mother, for whom he had searched for years, told him, 'I have no son' at her own wedding, the first time they met. And one can safely assume that his rejection as 'unsuitable for conversion' by a pair of Mormon missionaries he attempted to befriend after they randomly knocked on his door must have cost him a significant amount of what precious little hope he had left. But this latest loss is one not even he could have anticipated, as he was unaware that he had any hope remaining at all. Incredibly, even greater pain may still lie ahead for Dempsey. Experts fear that the German-letter incident may lead to the discovery of other Lilliputian bits of undiscovered hope, all of which are certain to be ultimately lost. "If this poor, miserable wretch can finally lose every last ounce of hope, then at least his life will be relatively bearable, inasmuch as he will have nothing more to lose," Wasserbaum said. "However, as long as there is even the slightest chance, no matter how astronomical the odds, that he has more undiscovered hope left inside him somewhere, he will always have the inevitable loss of that hope hanging over him like a dank cloud of black soul-sludge, waiting to devour him in a pit of churning agony. "Of course, maybe this was the last time, after all, and he is completely hopeless for good," said Wasserbaum. "But even that scenario constitutes a form of hope, making his overall prospects of eventually finding a stable, hope-free existence a distant hope at best.

Neighborhood Children Gear Up For Hotly Anticipated 'Opening Of The Gerbil's Tomb'
COVINGTON, KY–In what promises to be the biggest neighborhood event since July's golf-ball dismantling, Andy Mefford, 9, announced plans Monday to exhume Marshall, his sister's deceased pet gerbil. "Guys," said Mefford, addressing fellow fourth-graders from the jungle gym during recess, "this Saturday morning, right after Batman Beyond, I'm gonna dig up Marshall to see what he looks like now. Marshall, who died June 24 of complications from an eye infection, was laid to rest the following day beneath the large oak tree in the Meffords' backyard. The gerbil was entombed in a styrofoam hamburger container, along with a daisy and a poem written by its devoted owner, 7-year-old Kimberly Mefford. Mefford's decision to exhume the rodent, made partly in response to a recent Learning Channel Secrets Of The Pyramids documentary, has sparked excitement among children throughout the Reardon Street area. "That's gonna be so cool," said classmate Danny Stossel. "I bet it's all gross, with worms crawling out of his eyes and stuff. "My brother once dug up a parakeet after it was buried for, like, three weeks, and it was all black and hard," next-door neighbor Douglas Beane, 10, said. "This'll probably be even better. Added Beane: "I wonder if the tail will still be there. Despite such enthusiasm, not all neighborhood children support the gerbil exhumation. "You can't dig somebody up after you bury them," said Amy Coryell, 7, who will not attend the dig. "That disturbs their spirit, and then you can get haunted by the dead ghost, I bet. Speculation regarding the contents of the Marshall gravesite is running high, with guesses ranging from a gerbil skeleton to a gerbil zombie. The latter theory was posited by Bradley Dorner, 9, who has been fixated by death and zombification since an Sept. 15 viewing of Return Of The Living Dead on cable TV while his parents were out at a play. "Seriously, there are these zombies, and they're dead bodies, and they come back to life and try to eat your brains," a visibly agitated Dorner told Mefford upon learning of the plan. "Including animals. I saw it. Unbowed by the prospect of attacks by the undead, Mefford reiterated his intention to open the styrofoam crypt. As a concession to those concerned about zombies, however, basic precautions against the undead will be taken, including the presence of garlic, a cross, and a Bible. In addition, a large shovel will be kept nearby for the purpose of hitting Marshall if he moves posthumously in any way. As an added measure, all children who plan to attend the ceremony have been sworn to strict secrecy by Mefford. "My mom is gonna take my sister to dance lessons at 11, and my dad never gets up before noon on Saturdays, so we have to do it between 11 and 12," Mefford told his jungle-gym audience. "But nobody tell anybody, or we'll get busted, okay? Mefford warned potential security threats that compromising the secrecy of the event by tipping off neighborhood adults or engaging in any other form of "telling" would result in their being barred from all future Mefford-sponsored events, including street-hockey games and secret-fort meetings. In addition, tattle-tales would be subject to revocation of treehouse-hideout privileges for one year.

My Moroccan Neighbors Won't Stop Their Damn Ululating
Well, there goes the neighborhood. Last week, the moving van pulls up to the Petersens' old house and — yup, you guessed it — a bunch of Moroccans move in. I haven't even met the Aatabous yet, but already I can't stand them: All night long, they won't stop with their damn ululating! To be honest, I haven't the foggiest notion what they're even wailing about. Maybe they're lamenting a deceased relative. Or retelling the traditional Moroccan folk tale The Girl Who Lived With The Gazelles. Or maybe they're just performing some Gnawa devotional trance music. All I know is, that damn ululating of theirs is loud, it's in D-sharp, and it goes on well past 9 p.m. Next time, I'm calling the cops. Last Monday night, I'm trying to relax in my own home — which I paid for with my hard-earned American dollars, mind you, not some wad of dirham — and enjoy the big game. The whole time, the Aatabous are out on their backyard patio, ululating up a storm! They've even got the Santur dulcimer and three-stringed Berber lutes going. I try to ignore it, but, finally, I just can't take it anymore. I open my window and shout, "Hey, would you mind keeping that bendir-thumping down to a dull roar? A man can only take so much of those cylindrical, single-membrane tambourines, you know! It usually gets better for a few days. They promise they'll try to keep it down. But like clockwork, the ululating always starts up again. And even on the days when their voices aren't raised together in a long, sorrowful cry, their teenage daughter is usually blaring that Moroccan pop singer Lem Chaheb out her bedroom window. As if that's an improvement. Isn't that always the way: You work hard to make a nice home for your family, and then, just when you're ready to enjoy the fruits of your labor, the whole neighborhood goes to the Moroccans. They move in and, just like that, braziers and woodcrafts stores start popping up on every corner. Guys are out there selling olives and pomegranates right on the street. Next thing you know, property values are plummeting. It gets worse, though — you should see what the Aatabous have done to the Petersens' front yard! They've got handmade rugs hanging out to dry and some sort of pet bird flapping around. They're laying hand-painted tiles left and right. It's an eyesore for the entire block! Then there are those horrible smells that come from their house — coriander, cumin, saffron. It's awful. Haven't these kebab-eaters ever heard of a Big Mac? Couscous marrakesh made with grilled lamb, batinjaan zalud dribbled with olive oil… I've got to smell that crap seven days a week! Then, to add insult to injury, I find out that the Aatabous come from the port city of Tétouan. Well, I don't have to tell you what those Moroccan coastal types are like, especially the men. They get all hopped up on mint tea and go out and have their way with white women. Thank God our daughters are grown up and out of the house, that's all I have to say. And I haven't even mentioned the bonfire dances. You know what I'm talking about. That guedra dance, where the woman starts out kneeling, hidden completely under a black veil. Pretty soon, her fingers are swaying to the music and, from there, it's anything goes. Before long, everyone is dancing the ahaidous, beating the ground rhythmically together in a circle. I won't have it! Not in my neighborhood, dammit! The way I see it, if you want to go bangy-bangy on your goatskin-topped wooden taarija drum, go back to Morocco. This is America, land of the Dallas Cowboys, John Wayne, and barbecued ribs. We don't cotton to that kind of stuff around here. Nothing, though, is worse than that incense wafting over the fence. When you smell that, you know exactly what's going on over there behind those walls. They're doing that crazy religious stuff, what with the dancing and the singing and the instruments. Damn Sufis. That's just what this country needs: more Gnostic sympathizers going on about tawakkul, the total reliance on God, and dhikr, the perpetual remembrance of God. We could move, I suppose, but it probably wouldn't do any good. My brother lives over on the east side of town, and he's having the same problem with the Inuits. No place is safe these days, I tell you. Fred Parker

Internet Friend Gradually Getting Creepier
DEDHAM, MA–According to Boston-area America Online user Josh Reuss, an Internet friendship between himself and Larry Vliet of Socorro, NM, is "getting a little creepy. The pair, who first met in a Quake III Arena chat room on AOL, quickly discovered that they share numerous interests and began a pattern of regular e-mails and instant-message conversations, which Reuss described as "pretty normal and enjoyable at first, but soon turned strange. "One time, we were playing Quake against each other, and he killed my guy," the 31-year-old Reuss said. "A few minutes after the game ended, I get this e-mail from him saying, 'Hey, sorry I killed you, Josh. But at least now you know what it's like to be dead.' I thought that was kind of weird, but then he added, 'P.S.–Did I tell you I'm going to be in D.C. next week? Maybe I'll swing by Dedham to see you.' That's, like, 500 miles away. Reuss' discomfort grew several days later during an e-mail exchange. "Larry e-mailed me, supposedly just to say hi, and toward the end of his message, he asked if I had a dog," Reuss said. "I said no. So he writes back and says that's too bad, because he was wondering if I knew of any good ways to keep a dog from howling. I'm thinking to myself: Why is he asking me for help with this? And why is his dog howling? The following week, Reuss e-mailed Vliet to inquire if his dog had finally settled down. Vliet responded that he didn't know what Reuss was talking about, informing him that he does not have a dog. "That was definitely some Twilight Zone shit there," Reuss said. "But then, just as I'm trying to process the whole dog thing, the thought suddenly pops into my head that he'd never made that trip to D.C. he'd been talking about. Why on Earth would someone lie about something like that? Compounding Reuss' unease are his repeated attempts to determine what Vliet does for a living. "A while back, I asked him what kind of job he has, just to try to start up a normal conversation, and he said, 'Oh, I do a bunch of stuff.' That got me curious, so I've asked him a few more times since, and he's always given these vague, evasive answers like, 'Oh, I pick up work here and there,' and 'Don't worry about me, Josh, I've got my ways of paying the rent, if you catch my drift.' No, I don't catch his drift. Another font of strangeness, Reuss said, is an ongoing conversational thread he calls "the web-page issue. "One of our first chats was about how tough it is to find good Half-Life levels on-line. At one point, I said someone should make a really good Half-Life-file web page, but he somehow got it into his head that I was saying this was something the two of us should do. He brings up 'our web page' every week or so, asking if I've made any progress. I keep telling him I don't know anything about web-site programming, but he just says, 'Well, there are books you can get that will teach you how to do it.' It's like, then you learn to do it. Recently, Reuss has taken to signing onto AOL under a name different from the one on his account and then checking his e-mail via AOL's web page, all in an effort to avoid Vliet. "I don't want to be rude to the guy, since, believe it or not, I'm still not 100 percent sure he's a psycho," Reuss said. "But just the same, I think I'll keep him at a healthy distance. Especially after yesterday's e-mail, where he went off about how he got drunk the other night and woke up the next morning in a hospital bed with scorpion bites all over his arms. I mean, if that story's true, that's weird. But if it's not true, well, that's even weirder.

Hypothetical Question Clearly Not Hypothetical
YUMA, AZ– Brad Thorstadt was rattled Monday, when hiking partner and longtime friend Ken Daniels asked him a hypothetical question that clearly was not hypothetical. "What the hell did he mean by, 'Hypothetically speaking, if you and Cheryl were into threesomes, would you consider me?' " Thorstadt asked. "That's not the kind of thing you just ask hypothetically.

Improved Communication Ruins Marriage
SANDY SPRINGS, GA–At the urging of loved ones and their marital counselor, struggling couple David and Joanne Hebner recently opened the channels of communication between them, bringing their 11-year marriage to an end. "It had been a long time since we openly and honestly expressed how we felt," Joanne said Monday. "About a month ago, we decided it was time to learn to share our thoughts about each other again. That was the beginning of the end. After years of marital stability rooted in mutual denial, the Hebners decided to open a floodgate of repressed feelings–anger, resentment, bitterness, betrayal, and regret–that precipitated their filing for separation on Aug. 11. "Our mutual friend Rochelle [Kerwin] said that we each had to look deep into our hearts and tell the other what we found," Hebner said. "Well, I found that I hate the fact that David is content merely being a high-school art teacher, and he found that he hates my 'obsession with climbing the social ladder.' After several weeks of openly communicating at the top of their lungs, the couple decided to see a counselor to find out if their marriage could be saved. "Joanne and David are the classic example of a couple who have fallen into harmful EDPs, or Emotion-Denial Patterns," Dr. Dorothea Boushea said. "They needed to relearn to express themselves. Only when partners open their hearts to each other's hopes, fears, and needs can a marriage grow. With Boushea's help, the Hebners realized just how much they truly disliked each other. "I tore down the wall I had built around myself and told Joanne what was hidden deep within my soul," David said. "Namely, that I can't stand the air of Southern gentility that pervades everything she does. I can't stand her anachronistic attitudes and values. I can't stand her family. I can't stand her accent. "On my own journey of discovery, I learned that I hate the fact that David has no overarching plan for his life," Joanne said. "I also learned that I hate the way he dresses. And his goatee. During one session, Dr. Boushea had David and Joanne each take out a sheet of paper and draw two columns. She then instructed them to write down all the things about their relationship that were positive on one side, and all the things they considered 'barriers to happiness' on the other. "Let's just say one of the columns continued on the back of the pages and onto another sheet of paper," Joanne said. "Then there was the fact that when Dr. Boushea asked us to underline what we considered the number-one obstacle to satisfaction in life, we both underlined each other's name. Once David and Joanne identified their problems, Boushea gave them a list of relevant books to read. "It seemed like we'd already figured out what to do, but Dr. Boushea insisted we give the books a shot anyway," David said. "It turns out, she was right: After reading the books, instead of worrying about whether we were doing the right thing, we were 100 percent sure. We made an appointment for the lawyer the very next day. Of all the books, the Hebners found Dr. Katharine Vine's A Beautiful Marriage In 10 Easy Steps the most helpful. During a role-playing exercise from chapter eight, "The Cornerstone Of Complete Honesty," Joanne told David about the affair she'd had with his best friend Mark. "I knew instantly I could never forgive Joanne for sleeping with Mark," David said. "But, thanks to our counseling, I learned that the best thing was to not lay blame on Joanne, but to look inside myself for answers. That's when I realized that her huge thighs and sagging breasts are huge turn-offs." "That was extremely helpful," Joanne said. "I'd always felt that making love to David was like making love to a log. And now I know why. He's revolted by my physical presence. As they begin the process of separating their belongings and selling their house, the couple takes solace in the fact that they were able to confront their marital difficulties head-on. "The worst thing two people can do is ignore the problems in their marriage," Joanne said. "Luckily, we didn't do that.

Eight-Pound Man Removed From Woman's Vagina
ALBUQUERQUE, NM–In a bizarre case that has baffled medical professionals across the country, surgeons at Albuquerque's Veterans Memorial Hospital removed a living eight-pound man from the confines of an area woman's vagina Monday. The unusually small man, who has refused to identify himself or give a reason for his presence in the vagina, was extremely disoriented throughout the incident, and, according to eyewitnesses, was "nude and covered in blood and gore. " Though the man strenuously resisted rescue attempts, screaming and kicking wildly at medical personnel, he has not yet been charged with any crime. The woman, Ruth Hessman, a 33-year-old systems analyst from nearby Winfield, was admitted to Veterans Memorial Hospital late Sunday night complaining of strange, repeated abdominal pains and contractions occurring at regular intervals. When the painful episodes were five minutes apart, her husband drove her to the hospital. "We get all kinds of strange things here in the emergency unit," said Dr. Carlos Mendoza, a surgeon at Veterans Memorial, "but this was something new. At first glance, Mrs. Hessman appeared to be obese, but upon closer examination, it became apparent that she was actually suffering from severe abdominal distension. After she described her painful symptoms, we conducted an examination of her vagina. Imagine our shock and surprise when we discovered that there, looking back at us, was a tiny human head. After overcoming their initial shock, doctors discovered that the grotesque miniature head belonged to a small man. The attending physicians performed emergency surgery to forcibly remove him, then notified local police. "At this time, we have no idea how this man came to be situated within the woman's vagina, or what motivation he might have had for being there," said Albuquerque police chief Burke Manning. "His dazed state, public defecating, and lack of clothing suggest that he is a mentally ill homeless man who was seeking shelter. Yet it's hard to believe that someone so feeble and mentally disturbed would be capable of such an intrusion. We have not ruled out the possibility that he had help. Manning is advising Albuquerque residents to stay calm. "This is likely an isolated event," he said. "But we are nevertheless considering conducting a search of all area vaginas to see if any more small, naked men are on the prowl. The eight-pound man has thus far refused to cooperate with police, responding to all questions with strange gurgling noises. He is also prone to sudden, violent mood swings, resting peacefully one moment and wailing uncontrollably the next. Adding to the difficulty of establishing the man's identity is his lack of fingerprints and teeth, making a match with federal records impossible. "This man seems to have undergone some sort of massive trauma within the last 24 hours which has, in effect, wiped his memory clean and turned his mind into a blank slate," Mendoza said. "To be honest, this case couldn't be any weirder if a stork had dropped him out of the sky.

Malignant Tumor Sees Every Day As Gift From God
MUNCIE, IN–On July 12, the cancerous growth imbedded in the brain tissue of Warren Lenders got the news no tumor ever wants to hear: chemotherapy. Facing the prospect of cancer-killing radiation, the six-month-old malignant brain tumor could have cursed the heavens for dealing it such a cruel fate. Instead, it chose to be grateful for the time it has left, viewing each new day as a gift from God. "God put me on this Earth for a purpose: to attach myself to the parietal lobe of loving husband and father of three Warren Lenders," said the tumor, speaking from the left hemisphere of Lenders' cerebrum. "But if He says it's time to go, then it's time to go. It is not for me to question why. "As it says in the Good Book," the high-grade cerebellar astrocytoma continued, "'If you have received God's Gift of Grace, rejoice. Enjoy it every day.' After tragically losing most of its mass in a June 28 operation, the tumor is now in the midst of 12 grueling weeks of chemotherapy, a procedure doctors say it has a less than 20 percent chance of surviving. "This has been the greatest trial of my entire life," the tumor said. "Operations, radium bombardment, cesium. You name it, I've been through it. But just as He did with Job, the Lord is presenting me with these hardships as a way of testing my faith. According to doctors at Indiana University Medical Center, where the tumor is being treated, malignancies of its kind generally have a 60 percent survival rate. But because the tumor was detected early, its chances are far worse. "Statistically, the odds are against it, no question," chief oncologist Dr. Irwin Patel said. "But this is one tough little tumor, and I wouldn't count it out. It's showing unusual tenacity for a supratentorial growth of its size. We thought the surgery would be the end, but when we got in there to debulk it, we found it had spread all over the place. Throughout the ordeal, the tumor has found comfort in its strong Christian faith. "Going into that surgery, I thought, 'Well, this could be the end of the line for me,'" the tumor said. "But, by some miracle, a few of my tendrils had adhered to the occipital lobe without the doctors realizing it, and I made it through the operation. I know in my heart it was God's hand guiding that surgeon's scalpel to the wrong place that day. After the surgery, the tumor's weight had dropped to 9.8 grams. "Some tumors might have thrown in the towel right then and there," it said. "But I'm not the type. I need only remember the trials that Jesus went through while in His earthly form to realize that my trials have been nothing. The tumor sees the fact that it is still alive as "part of God's great plan. "May I quote The Bible again? 'For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,'" the tumor said. "I guess I'm so calm because I know that when it's my time to go, a better life awaits me in Heaven, where I will be rewarded for my faith with a glorious bounty of ganglion and glial cells, the likes of which a mortal being like myself cannot even conceive. With its time possibly drawing to a close, the tumor reflected on its life. "Honestly, I've been lucky," it said. "I could have been born an easily detectable epidermoid cyst and been destroyed swiftly. But instead, I was hidden by the bone matter of Lenders' skull and went undetected by X-rays for months. The tumor also draws comfort and strength from its offspring. "In my life, I've been fortunate enough to metastasize three dozen beautiful little cancerous cell masses, which I've sent off into the cerebrospinal fluid," it said. "Right now, they're just imperceptible growths on the spinal cord and medulla. But, God willing, when I've gone to my maker, they will be there to carry on my work. Praise the Lord."

" McNally said she cannot say whether or not she likes Wheeler because she simply doesn't know him well enough, because whenever he visits, she hardly sees him, since the two of you spend the entire time at the bars.

Apartment Full Of Jesus Stuff Brings Date To Screeching Halt
PAWTUCKET, RI–A first date that "actually seemed to be going pretty well" came to a screeching halt Saturday, when area resident Kyle Richman stepped into Melinda Tulle's Christ-packed apartment. "Immediately upon walking into the living room, I spotted that framed Last Supper hanging above the couch," said Richman, 32, speaking from the safety of his own non-Jesus-themed apartment. "It took me about half a second to realize that it just wasn't going to happen for the two of us. Richman expressed regret that the evening turned sour, but also relief that he "found out when [he] did. "It was only our first date, but I'd been thinking I might have actually found someone nice for a change," Richman said. "But when I saw all those Jesus eyes staring down at me, I realized I'd made a mistake–a big mistake. Among the other Christian decorative items Richman encountered were rosary beads, a St. Peter statuette, several glass angels arranged on an end table, and a gruesomely detailed Christ-on-the-crucifix painting casually placed above the television. Excusing himself to the bathroom to collect his thoughts, Richman found a Virgin Mary night light and a heavily highlighted book titled Living Your Faith. "The book sealed it," Richman said. "She wasn't just a Christian; she was one who actually 'lived her faith.' There was no way to make it work between us. Just minutes prior, an excited Richman had been driving Tulle home as the two energetically discussed music. "All of Melinda's favorite bands were ones I'd never even heard of–Footprints, Garden's Edge, Everybodyduck, Concrete Jesus–so I figured they must be some of those alternative bands I don't know anything about," Richman said. "When she asked me if I wanted to stop up to her apartment and borrow some CDs, I said sure. I was like, wow, this date must be going even better than I thought if she's asking me up to her place. Even after seeing the Jesus-laden apartment, Richman said he still clung to the faint hope that the religious items belonged to a roommate. Tulle confirmed, however, that the Jesus stuff did belong to her and was not there for any kitsch value. "My faith is very important to me," Tulle told Richman. "It makes me feel at home to know the Lord's presence is near. Please, sit down. I'll get you something to drink. Said Richman: "I honestly never saw it coming. I mean, she was wearing a cross around her neck, but I figured it didn't mean much. Lots of Christians wear those, not just Christian Christians." The pair met on Mar. 12 when Tulle came into the Eastgate Mall B. Dalton where Richman works to buy a book for her niece. The purchase led to a brief conversation between Richman and Tulle about their own favorite childhood books, and he asked her out to dinner. Richman reported that the date began well. He and Tulle enjoyed dinner at a local Italian restaurant, enthusiastically discussing their shared love of dogs, camping, and The Wizard Of Oz, and then stopped by a nearby ice-cream shop for sundaes. "It was going great: She was laughing at all my jokes and said I had 'wonderfully deep' eyes," Richman said. "At one point, I suggested that we go to a dance bar, but she said she didn't really like dancing. Now I see it's probably not so much that she doesn't like dancing but is against dancing. And when she said most movies and TV shows are awful these days, she didn't mean lame or dumb, but sinful. The evening ended approximately 10 minutes after Richman entered the apartment, when Tulle mentioned she was going to church the following morning. "Before she could get a chance to invite me, I said I thought I left my car door unlocked and got the hell out of there," Richman said. "The worst part is, I can't even just avoid her because I have all these CDs I have to return. Christ."

Attempt To Impress Becky Lundegaard Undermined By Interloper
HAMPTON, VA–An attempt by Brian Shuman, 12, to impress fellow seventh-grader Becky Lundegaard, 13, met with spectacular failure Monday, when his school supplies and shoulder bag were forcibly seized, his sweater vest yanked over his head, and his face pressed into a row of lockers, witnesses reported. According to the unpopular Shuman, known primarily among classmates at Hampton Middle School for his scholastic achievements and awkward social manner, he was "deliberately undermined by the uncalled-for actions of an interloping usurper intent on humiliating me in a derogatory manner in front of Miss Lundegaard, thus ruining my chances with her in the foreseeable future. Shuman, who has long considered the elusive Lundegaard "really pretty," has admired her from a distance since the fifth grade, but never spoke to her for more than a few minutes until three weeks ago, when he was randomly assigned to be her lab partner in fifth-period Earth Science. Sources close to the straight-A student said the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to talk to Lundegaard in class laid the groundwork for Monday's impression attempt, which was made shortly before lunch hour at a location near Lundegaard's locker. Shuman approached and was about to strike up a conversation when the interloper, varsity wrestling champion Lance Pulaski, 13, arrived on the scene. Pulaski lifted the comparatively slight Shuman off the floor by the back of his shirt before hurling the hapless would-be suitor against a nearby wall. The popular student-athlete offered no comment at the time of the incident other than laughter and a terse, mumbled issuance of the term "dorkass," presumably aimed at Shuman. Pulaski then began an extended and reportedly friendly conversation with Lundegaard that lasted, according to hall monitor Gregg Nussbaum, "right up to the second five-minute bell before the start of fourth-period gym. According to an anonymous source who overheard Lundegaard talking about the incident by the bike racks later that day, Lundegaard described Pulaski as "cute," though that report remains unconfirmed by either Lundegaard or those within her immediate circle of associates, including Jessica, Brianna, Ashley, Stephanie, Lisa, Jennifer, Sarah H., Sarah W., Tami, Michelle, Nicole, and Christina. When asked for comment on Shuman's failed attempt, Lundegaard said, "Who? Look, I've got Michelle on the other line, and she's going to tell me what Brittany Ryback said about Stacey Schwaba, so can this wait? Observers throughout the Hampton Middle School student body remain baffled as to what motivated Shuman to think he was in a position to approach Lundegaard in a social context in the first place. "Becky Lundegaard is so out of Brian's league," said student-council treasurer Iris Paulson. "How he could be smart enough to win the district Academic Decathlon but still not be able to figure that out is beyond me. The general consensus among students is that Shuman's attempted overture was ill-advised from the start. Spelling-club insiders, however, said Shuman continues to insist that the failure was entirely the result of Pulaski's intrusion and in no way due to any shortcoming on his part. "Brian was going on and on about how last Friday, Becky was smiling at him when he explained how to measure a solvent's concentration in a solution, and I was like, 'Duh, Brian, that's because she knew she'd get an easy A in the class if you did all the work for her," said Shuman's friend and debate-team partner Bobby Gannett. "I mean, no doy. I put forth the proposition that he is suffering from a delusion of epic proportions. Gannett then began laughing in a snorting, wheezing manner before being silenced by a hail of spitwads. "Despite the contrarian position taken by certain people I shall not name," said Shuman, pausing to glare at Gannett from across the library, "I am more than convinced that Becky would've been delighted and charmed by the pyrex graduated cylinder I planned to show her that fateful day in the hall. I ordered it special online, and it is far more heat-resistant than the substandard plastic beakers we are issued in class. Who wouldn't be impressed by such an item? "Unfortunately," Shuman continued, "Mr. Stupid Muscle-Face Wrestle-Head Lance Pul-asshole-ski sent the item in question flying when he pounded me into submission. Whereupon it shattered after landing a distance of at least 10 meters away. How am I supposed to impress her now? The incident is considered the worst failure to impress a Lundegaard at Hampton Middle School since 1988, when eighth-grader Rodney Siefert purchased a pair of boat shoes in an attempt to impress Jennifer Lundegaard, then 14, Becky's older cousin. The attempt turned tragic when Siefert made the sartorial blunder of wearing the boat shoes with socks, incurring the derision and scorn of his more fashion-forward peers. Though not confirmed as of press time, reports indicate that Pulaski may have gotten to first base, and possibly even second, with Lundegaard after last Friday's spring dance.

Area Woman Offended For Fourth Time In One Day
BROOKLINE, MA–Irene Fowles was offended by a telemarketer who called during the dinner hour Tuesday, raising the total number of times the 56-year-old homemaker had been offended that day to four. "I simply could not believe the nerve of that so-and-so, calling just as my husband and I were finally sitting down to the nice meal I had prepared," Fowles told reporters gathered in front of her suburban Boston home. "Imagine harassing decent people in the middle of their private time like that. How dare he? Fowles' mark of four falls short of the all-time Boston-area single-day offense-taking record of seven, set by Somerville secretary Florence Bullock in 1981. It is, however, a personal best for Fowles, who on a daily basis is forced to endure slights, rebuffs, affronts, and astonishing gall from a wide range of sources. The first instance of offense took place at 9:20 a.m. while Fowles was watching the syndicated talk show Leeza. The topic of the show was Charles Manson, and Fowles was shocked to learn of a subculture of youths who greatly admire the serial killer, sending him fan mail and buying T-shirts and posters bearing his image. "'Outraged' is too mild a word to describe my reaction when I heard this," Fowles said. "'Sickened' is more like it. How can anyone admire that evil man? It deeply disturbs me that with all the millions of unsung heroes out there, like teachers and paramedics and neighborhood-watch people, young people would worship a monster like Charles Manson. And Leeza's not much better herself for giving these wackos a forum to air their twisted views. Shame on her. The disapproval continued approximately three hours later when Fowles stopped by First Boston Savings & Loan to withdraw money for grocery shopping. Though the bank was nearly empty, the area facing the tellers' windows was elaborately roped off. "After filling out my withdrawal slip, I worked my way through the ropes," Fowles said. "I felt a little silly winding through them when I could have directly walked to a teller window, but I felt I was supposed to. Before Fowles could reach the teller windows, however, a man entered the lobby and walked directly to the teller window, where he was immediately served. "That really got my goat," Fowles said. "Obviously, I was there in the line before the man, but because I followed the rules, I was the one who got the short shrift. The worst part is, when I complained to the teller, she said she didn't see what happened. It's bad enough that the guy cuts in front of me, but then, when a representative of the very institution whose ropes I'm walking through at their request doesn't even seem to care, well, that's when I really must take issue. Added Fowles: "I wonder if the real reason I got ignored is because I'm a woman. After an unexpectedly umbrage-free trip to the supermarket, Fowles returned home, only to be "taken aback" by the realization that that her friend Shirley Reynolds, a 48-year-old registered nurse and Tupperware representative, had neglected to place a Tupperware catalog in her mailbox as promised. "The new Tupperware catalogs were supposed to be out on the 25th, and Shirley knew that I want to order some new CrystalWave microwave bowls, since my daughter Lindsay took my original ones," Fowles said. "I must have told Shirley on at least on three separate occasions that when the new catalogs come out, please stick one in my mailbox. Well, she promised me she would on Tuesday afternoon, but when I got home, no catalog. That really steamed me. "Friendly favors aside," Fowles continued, "if you're in the Tupperware business, you should take care of your customers. Especially when they're perfectly capable of going out to Wal-Mart and buying some Pyrex or Rubbermaid bowls–for less money, I might add. Unless, of course, Shirley's doing so well as a Tupperware representative that I'm not important enough a customer to be considered worthy of a catalog. As of press time, it is not known how Fowles will respond to the various offenses. Fowles' husband, however, said she will likely seek satisfaction through indirect reproach. "Irene's forever writing letters to the editor, filling out comment cards, and complaining to assistant managers," said Dean Fowles, 59. "But four offenses in one day is remarkable even for her. She's loaded for bear, let me tell you. In the past, Fowles has been offended by a wide range of matters, including the Clinton-Lewinsky imbroglio, the adult humor content on Fox's That '70s Show, and not being asked to make something for her church's July 1998 bake sale. Dick Hollingsworth, president of the Dallas-based courtesy-advocacy group Of All The Incredible Nerve, sympathized with Fowles. "When I heard about the many indignities Irene suffered, I rolled my eyes and clucked my tongue disapprovingly," Hollingsworth said. "It's all very typical, isn't it? Absolutely no regard for how the other person might feel. Just an hour ago, I looked outside at the parking lot and saw these kids sitting on my car waiting for the bus. Just sitting on my car like it was a park bench! The nerve. And have you seen that Kellogg's Rice Krispies Treats commercial where the man's arm is ripped off his body in the subway? Whose idea of humor is that? Certainly not mine. I have to be subjected to this kind of trash day in and day out, and I'm fed up. Well, Kellogg's is going to get one angry letter from me, let me tell you.

Man Carefully Selects T-Shirt For Night Out
WILMINGTON, NC–After nearly half an hour of trying on different T-shirts, Wilmington resident Larry Goltz finally settled on a black Peterbilt Trucks shirt for a night on the town Saturday. "I was going to wear my Blockbuster Video T-shirt, but it's white, and I wanted something a little nicer for a Saturday night. Plus, I wore that one when we went bowling Tuesday," Goltz said. "I was also thinking about my plain red one, but for some reason, I was in the mood to wear something with writing on it. And I like the way the Peterbilt logo on the chest draws attention away from my belly. " Goltz said he is "99 percent sure" he made the right choice.

Local Welder Suffering From Welder's Block
EASTON, PA–Area welder Bruce Meacham admitted Monday that he is suffering from a severe case of welder's block. "I know what I want to do," Meacham said. "I need to get this supporting strut attached to the main body of this girder. But I keep running into a wall every time I sit down and try to actually weld. " Meacham said he spent the better part of last Saturday putting on his goggles, starting up his acetylene torch, and then merely staring at the two pieces of metal for hours. "You've got to understand, welding is a creative act," Meacham said. "It's not the kind of thing where you can just punch the clock and do it from nine to five.

Slightly Upset Woman Declared Insane
NORTH CALDWELL, NJ–Area resident Gayle Wenzel, 44, was declared legally insane Monday after becoming upset over a living-room mess caused by her husband Milt's Friday-night get-together with friends. "Apparently, Gayle came home after being gone all weekend, saw the condition of the living room, and just completely lost it," said Dr. Marvin Schaffer, director of hysteriatrics at St. Joseph's Hospital in nearby Montclair. "This is clearly a clinically psychotic individual who has no grip on reality and no control over her own actions or emotions. You know how women get. Wenzel, who insists that she was "only mad for about two minutes," is currently under 24-hour watch at St. Joseph's. According to Milt, on Sunday evening, Gayle returned home after spending four days in Kansas City helping her sister recover from back surgery. Upon entering the living room, she found empty beer cans scattered across the floor, an ashtray overturned on the rug, and a pile of dirty dishes on the end table next to the couch. "Gayle asked me what happened. I told her that some of the guys came over Friday night, but that I didn't clean up because I couldn't find the vacuum cleaner," Milt said. "That's when she went nuts. "You left that mess for me to clean up. You had zero intention of ever doing it yourself, Milt," Wenzel reportedly yelled like a lunatic. "Well, I'm not touching it. I've spent the entire day in airports, and I have to be up for work at 6 a.m. tomorrow. You clean it. Milt said that all of his many attempts to make his psychotic wife listen to reason failed. "Gayle was out of her mind," Milt said. "I was pleading with her, 'Honey, calm down. What's the big deal? You're acting insane. Get it together.' But she just kept freaking out. Twenty minutes later, after putting her bags away and showering, Wenzel went back downstairs to discover a team of emergency medical technicians and crisis-intervention counselors waiting for her. After placing Wenzel in restraints and rushing her to St. Joseph's Hospital, doctors were able to administer a strong sedative. "I had to do something to ensure that Gayle wouldn't harm herself or others," said Dr. Gilbert Perry, who handled Wenzel's hospital admission. "Gayle was out of her mind. I mean, come on, a few beer cans lying around and she completely goes off the deep end? As soon as I learned that the outburst was not menstruation-related, as I'd initially assumed, I ordered her hospitalized. I couldn't let an unbalanced, over-emotional woman like that out on the streets. Wenzel has allegedly had a long history of out-of-control behavior, particularly at work. According to coworkers, she has reacted irrationally to everything from having to work weekends to having her assigned parking spot taken away. "Last week, I made a little friendly joke about the dark hair on Gayle's upper lip by calling her Tom Selleck," said Stuart Runnels, a fellow claims processor at Mid-American Insurance. "You should've seen her flip out. I was just kidding around, but she gets all deranged and says, 'I really don't think that was very funny at all, Stan. I don't make fun of your personal appearance.' Runnels said he responded by making cuckoo noises and backing away from Wenzel with an exaggerated look of fright. "What can I say? " Runnels said. "She's crazy.

Insurance Executive Fakes Own Life
WARREN, MI–Gordon Krumrie, a 43-year-old executive with Great Lakes Mutual, admitted Tuesday that he faked his own life to collect a substantial insurance payoff. "It was simple," said Krumrie, who came clean after collecting more than $300,000 over a 25-year period. "Just fool the right people, make my life look believable, and every month, Great Lakes would cut me a check for $5,000." "Plus bonuses," he added. "If they only knew. Krumrie began laying the groundwork for his false identity at an early age. In high school, he fabricated an interest in community and local business affairs, getting elected student-council treasurer and president of his school's chapter of Future Business Leaders of America. "It was dirty work, but I had to establish a credible cover story early," Krumrie said. "It's the first thing those insurance investigators check when they suspect a wrongful life has been committed. Krumrie's deception continued at Western Michigan University, where he earned an economics degree, deceiving professors into thinking he had a genuine interest in a career in finance. All the while, he made the necessary behind-the-scenes connections. "I spent four years playing along with those Sigma Chi bastards," Krumrie said. "But they left me no choice. Some of them had highly placed fathers in key firms. Upon being hired by Great Lakes Mutual in 1982, Krumrie was careful to behave like a typical sycophantic company man, running for coffee, calling superiors by their initials, and learning important insurance lingo like "great" and "happy to do it for you, boss. "I had to make my life seem real while establishing a paper trail," Krumrie said. "That way, if the company became suspicious enough to investigate, they'd find hundreds of calls to the head office on my telephone records and my fingerprints all over countless claimant response forms. There's no way they could have proven that my existence was a hollow sham. Outside the office, Krumrie was careful to cover his tracks, marrying a nice, conservative woman he met at a church mixer, buying a home in the suburbs, and devoting hours of his spare time to lawn care and maintenance. "I knew I could never let up," Krumrie said. "The tiniest slip, like forgetting to golf with the fellas on Saturdays or letting my Optimist Club membership lapse, would look suspicious. You can't give the insurance company any reason to suspect that your life is a fraud. Over time, however, Krumrie became worn down by his hoax of an existence. "Just a few more years, and I would have been be ready to end it all and cash in on that huge 401K," Krumrie said. "If I hadn't buckled under the strain, I would've run off to some tropical island beach with Janice from Accounting, and no one would have ever found me. "All that insurance money," continued Krumrie, shaking his head. "But I just couldn't keep it up. I couldn't stand the lies. Faking your own life is harder than it looks.

Cocktail-Party Guest Cornered By Joel Stein
NEW YORK–An innocent Upper West Side cocktail party turned tragic Tuesday, when journalist Michael Conlon found himself cornered by Time magazine columnist Joel Stein. "There I was, making light conversation and sipping a dry white wine, when, all of a sudden, I heard those four fateful words: 'Hi, I'm Joel Stein,'" a visibly shaken Conlon said following the 45-minute ordeal. "We covered a wide range of topics, from Joel Stein's favorite restaurants to Joel Stein's dating prospects, to anecdotes about famous people Joel Stein had met. " According to witnesses, Stein paused briefly at several intervals to make sure Conlon was still nodding politely before launching back into his otherwise non-stop conversational stream. Conlon is said to be "recovering well" after an overnight stay at Mt. Sinai Hospital and should return to the cocktail-party circuit by early next week.

X-Files Fan Killed For Knowing Too Much
EUGENE, OR–Mounting evidence in the murder case of Roy Bannister, the 27-year-old X-Files fan whose body was found beaten beyond recognition in his home Sunday, strongly suggests that he was killed for "knowing too much" about the long-running Fox series, investigators said Tuesday. "He knew everything about that show–who was conspiring with whom, where the bodies were buried, the latest top-secret plot developments–everything," said detective Nathan Tillinghast of the Eugene police department. "And he was willing to spill his guts to the first sucker who asked him. It was practically all he ever talked about. All the evidence we've collected points to someone wanting to shut him up. The victim's friends agreed. "Roy would get started on Scully's alien implant, or the Cancer Man's paternal fascination with Mulder, and he'd just talk about it for hours," said Albert Hashimoto, the night manager of the 7-11 convenience store where Bannister was last seen alive. "Finally, I had to tell him, 'Look, Roy, I'm your friend, but if you keep talking about this show constantly, somebody's gonna want to kill you. Roy's sister, Julia Bannister, said she pleaded with him repeatedly to give up his dangerous obsession before it was too late. "If I told him once, I told him a million times: 'Roy, shut the hell up about the goddamn stupid X-Files. It's just not cool. And it's not even all that popular anymore," Julia told police. "But he wouldn't keep quiet, and now somebody's silenced him for good. "Roy would corner people at parties and just totally go off on all this sci-fi stuff," said close friend Rob Settles, who was "deeply disturbed" by Bannister's insistence that aliens, working closely with secret factions deep within the U.S. government, were the most important thing on television. "We were always afraid that one day he'd talk to the wrong person. And he did. "There's no doubt that Roy knew a lot more about The X-Files than was healthy for a person," said Tillinghast, who now faces the grim task of sifting through more than 150 separate pieces of X-Files-related evidence from Bannister's efficiency apartment, including videotaped episodes, fanzines, magazine articles, and nitpicker's guides to all eight seasons. "Believe me when I say there's information in that apartment that no man should know. Police are still without a prime suspect, estimating that it will take months to go through the long list of people who may have had an interest in keeping Bannister quiet. "At this point, we've narrowed it down to everyone who'd ever talked to him for more than five minutes," Tillinghast said. "But since there have been no follow-up crimes, I guess we can at least breathe a little easier and assume that whatever Bannister knew died with him. Thank God."

Witty Remark Repeated Throughout Week
HIBBING, MN–According to coworkers at Hibbing Vacuum Repair & Supply, all week long, Ed Andersen has been repeating a witty remark he made Monday. The original quip surfaced when Andersen spotted ordinarily dowdy coworker Jim Billick sporting a tie and remarked, "Hot date tonight, Jimbo?" Later that day, Andersen saw Billick in the break room and told coworker Lydia Samuels, "Old loverboy here's got a hot date tonight. " When Billick arrived at work Tuesday, Andersen asked him, "So, how'd your hot date go?

Local Mother Clips Article About Benefits Of Vitamin E
FLAGSTAFF, AZ — In her most recent attempt to feel relevant and necessary in the life of her daughter, area retiree Frances Crandall clipped and mailed a Parade magazine article on the health benefits of Vitamin E to daughter Jennifer Reid of St. Paul, MN, Monday. "Jenny needs to see this," Crandall said. "She can use all the health information she can get, considering how active she is at the bank. " In the past month, Crandall has mailed Reid two Reader's Digest articles, the Bill Cosby book Kids Say The Darndest Things, and a sock-drawer organizer that will "keep her socks from getting all mixed up. " Crandall also telephoned Reid twice when the Weather Channel predicted rain in the Twin Cities area.

This Town Ain't Big Enough For The Both Of Us, Unless We Can Reach Some Sort Of Mutually Acceptable Compromise
I reckon everyone from Silver City to Carson's Gulch knows that you're here in my town, you sour-bellied varmint. And everyone knows that having two gunslingers like us in a town like this is like putting two ruttin' bobcats in a burlap sack. You see, this town, pardner, just ain't big enough for the both of us. Unless, of course, we can work out some sort of equitable, mutually agreeable compromise. Then maybe we could both stay. There's gonna be blood between us, hombre, because I'd just as soon spit in your eye as look at you. I got me an itchy trigger finger, and there's only one thing that can scratch it — and that's filling your flea-bitten hide full of lead at high noon tomorrow. Exceptin', that is, unless you wanna have some sort of mediated discussion, during which we could each air our respective dissatisfactions and maybe find a way to avoid bloodshed. You know, talk things out in a civilized manner and try to find some middle ground we can both agree to. That might be better'n fightin'. I heard what you said about me bein' yellow-bellied, an' you're lower'n a bloodsuckin' tick's belly if you think I'm gonna stand for it, you bowlegged half-breed. Though, in all fairness, you mighta just been callin' me yella in the heat of the moment and didn't really mean it. But I don't cotton to bein' called a welsher by no man, if that's what you meant to imply. So I dare you to step across this here line I drew in the street, you mangy owlhoot. You done said some low-down things about Nacogdoches Slim, and I'm gonna make you slap leather. You're gonna be coffin stuffin's before the sun sets tomorrow, pard, unless you can come up with some other way of settling our differences. Like maybe we could sit down and talk about how we feel, and through open and honest communication, each try to get a better sense of the other's perspective. Or maybe we could exchange gifts as a way of saying sorry for the hurt we've caused. Oh, if you do agree to have a gunfight and don't like where I done drew the line, I could draw it in another street. Or even in a different location on this street, you back-bitin' peckerwood. And don't go lookin' for no help from that weak-kneed sheriff, neither. He's been scared to death of Nacogdoches Slim ever since I showed him I could plea-bargain a manslaughter charge better'n any man since Sam Houston hisself. And, besides, it was self-defense. So it's up to you an' me to settle this, mano a mano, until one of us lies dead. But hopefully, it doesn't have to come to that. Nacogdoches Slim

Woman Angered When Veiled Anger Expressed As Mock Anger Is Interpreted As Real Anger
CHEEKTOWAGA, NY — Anger was the order of the day Tuesday, when area resident Gwen McCullers, 41, reacted angrily to husband Craig's insinuation that she was angry. Sources report that real anger over an inexpensive, thoughtless anniversary gift surfaced in the form of thinly veiled mock anger on the part of Gwen, who suggested to Craig that "another goddamn cheap beaded car seat" would be a suitable gift for his mother's 70th birthday. Gwen's veiled anger, which she disguised as mock anger, turned to openly displayed real anger when Craig responded, "What? You said you didn't want to make a big deal out of the anniversary. " After 15 minutes of discussing the various complexities, emotional underpinnings and larger implications of the previous discussion, both parties walked off angrily. "I was just pretending to be angry as a little joke," Gwen said angrily.

Non-Spooktacular Haunted House Under Fire From Community
MALDEN, MA — A group of outraged community members gathered at city hall Monday to protest a Malden Jaycees' House Of Horror they called "utterly un-spooktacular." "This so-called 'spooktacular' haunted house claims to offer both thrills and chills," said Barb Weyner, official spokesperson for the coalition of angry citizens. "Yet visitors to this sham of a devilish diversion reported that not only did their blood fail to run cold, but that no fiendish fun is to be had throughout the entire non-hair-raising experience. "This house is not a scream," Weyner added. "And, as far as I can tell, people are not dying to get in. After 20 minutes of chanting, "Hey-hey! Ho-host! The House Of Horror has got to ghost! " the demonstrators were led into Mayor Sidney Trent's office, demanding that the supposedly frightastic haunted house be closed. Trent promised to "immediately look into these serious allegations of substandard spookery. Located in Jaycee member Will Banghart's unfinished basement, the embattled haunted house opened its doors to the public Oct. 15. Since then, its opponents claim, it has failed to induce fearful fun in any of the roughly 250 people who have paid $4.75 to enter. With the house's highly publicized Creepy Costume Contest and pumpkin-carving party just days away, the group felt that now was the time to act, before too many others were drawn to the less-than-eerie abode. "This sort of second-rate, un-creeptastic dungeon of doom may be acceptable in other neighborhoods, but not in mine," said concerned parent Erin Willis. "My own children were lured to this Halloween happening with promises of a ghoulishly good time. But once inside, they discovered a very un-nightmarish netherworld of fake cobwebs, colored light bulbs and muffled sound effects. A number of other non-spine-chilling shenanigans were cited by the house's critics, including unpainted tombstones obviously constructed of styrofoam, eyeless bed-sheet ghosts, and construction-paper bats that were lazily taped to the ceiling rather than being suspended from fishing line. In addition, contrary to promises made in an ad in last Sunday's Malden Bugle-Tribune, there has been little to no "frolicking with Frankenstein," as the five-foot-six monster is almost always busy tending to the house's dry-ice buckets. "They call that a Trick Or Treat Terror Trail?" Willis said. "I've seen scarier axe murderers on the Luther League Haunted Hayride." Of all the people who have passed through the House Of Horror to date, only a handful reported being even mildly tormented. "Do they think I'm stupid or something? " 14-year-old Jeff Engers asked. "Those were obviously peeled grapes in that bowl. "Yeah," agreed Engers' 11-year-old sister Tara. "And those rats were so totally plastic. As of press time, the Jaycees have declined to respond to charges that the House Of Horror is sub-ghastly. "We're open Friday through Sunday from 6 to 9 p.m. Come on in for a frightfully good time… if you dare," said Jaycees vice-president/mummy Marilyn Schulte, bending to wrap lengths of toilet paper around her legs. "And please, no children under eight.

Newly Unearthed Time Capsule Just Full Of Useless Old Crap
ATCHISON, KS — A deep sense of disappointment gripped the citizens of Atchison, KS, Tuesday, when a 60-year-old time capsule unearthed from the site of a demolished library was found to contain a bunch of useless old crap. "What were the people who buried this thing thinking? " asked Atchison mayor Donald Kirschwald, following a capsule-opening ceremony at Atchison Town Hall. "None of this stuff is worth a red cent. It's all a bunch of stupid, worthless junk: newspapers, photographs, children's toys, sheet music, a pen knife, an iron and some rusty kitchen appliances. Big deal. The capsule — a large wooden crate bearing the words, "For The People Of The Future, So That They May Come To Know Us" — is believed to have been buried in 1939 during the dedication of the just-built Atchison Public Library. Earlier this month, as the library was torn down to make room for a new Steak & Shake, demolitions workers came across the capsule, which had been sealed in the building's cornerstone. Though the capsule also bore the instructions, "Not to be unsealed until 2939 A.D.," civic leaders decided it should be opened as soon as possible. "Everyone was very excited about the capsule," Kirschwald said. "We thought, 'What if it contains gold? Or pirate treasure? Or a deed to a diamond mine?' We also figured that by the time 2939 rolled around, folks would probably know how to synthesize gold and other precious metals anyway, so why let them get all the good stuff when we could really use it now? As word got around Atchison that the contents of a circa-1939 time capsule were to be revealed in a public ceremony, rumors about its contents began to fly. Local residents conjectured that it contained everything from solid-gold Egyptian tomb idols to the British crown jewels to vials of pure uranium. "The speculation really got ridiculous," Kirschwald said. "How would a Kansas farm town get a hold of Egyptian tomb idols, especially during the Depression? It's just absurd. Now, Disney stock certificates, that's what I was counting on. But when the capsule was finally opened, a collective groan rose up among Atchison residents. Instead of treasure, the capsule merely yielded banal items of everyday function. Among the "artifacts" were photographs of prominent Atchison residents, postcards of town landmarks, a spoon, a vacuum tube, a measuring pitcher, an alarm clock, a Bakelite comb, a washboard, a pair of spectacles, a die-cast toy car, a Sears-Roebuck catalog, a pair of leather shoes made in the now-defunct Atchison Shoe Works, detailed statistics of Atchison County's 1938 agricultural output, and a stack of hand-written county birth records. "The first question was, 'Why?' Why would the town fathers bury a box full of junk? " Kirschwald asked. "A letter included with the time capsule explained that the items are designed to give future generations an idea of how people lived and what life was like in Atchison in 1939. Well, who cares about that? Added Kirschwald: "Yeah, pretty impressive, people of 1939. Thanks for giving us the priceless, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to look at all of your old garbage. Perhaps the most unusual item in the capsule was an elaborately calligraphed document titled, "A Proclamation To The Peoples Of The Distant Future." "It is our profound hope," the document read, "that as the clouds of war once again darken the Earth here in 1939, you, our descendants of the year 2939, will have come to realize that the destruction of civilization in the name of nationalism is too great a price to bear. It is also our hope that peace, harmony and prosperity will embrace your world as it has eluded ours. "Boring!" said Cub Foods cashier Sherri Gower, 20, who witnessed the capsule-opening ceremony during a cigarette break. "It would've been a lot more interesting if they'd included something cool, like a signed murder confession from a famous citizen or a severed hand or something. Instead, they give us some big lecture about how bad war is. Well, duh. University of Kansas history professor Dr. Curtis Dandridge said the capsule's dullness is a reflection of the time from which it came. "The 1930s were one of the most boring eras in American history," Dandridge said. "People didn't have a lot of money or education, so they amused themselves in simple ways. Yes, there were movies, but they were in crude black-and-white and didn't have any swearing, nudity or special effects. Radio also existed, but the programs were hokey and old-fashioned. So planting a time capsule was, for these people, a departure from their horribly dull routines. But their poverty, combined with their naïvete and limited knowledge of the world, left them no choice but to put cheap, uninteresting stuff in their time capsule. The capsule's contents are currently being stored in a broom closet in Atchison Town Hall. "It's yours for the taking, if you're interested," Kirschwald said. "But we'll probably end up tossing that stuff out. Not even the libraries around here want that crap. Do you know anyone who uses vacuum tubes these days?

Computer-Generated Talking Cat On TV Delights Iowa Woman
OTTUMWA, IA — A computer-manipulated talking cat in a commercial for Fresh Step cat litter thoroughly delighted Ottumwa resident Sheila Dagenhardt Monday. "Honey, you've got to come in here and see this ad! " Dagenhardt called out to husband Dale, who was in the kitchen making a bowl of microwave popcorn at the time. "It's so adorable! Dale, who missed a majority of the 30-second spot, managed to race back to the living room in time to see the cat's owner hold out a bag of Fresh Step cat litter, to which the sass-talking feline responded, "Meow you're talking! The ad then ended with an announcer delivering a warning to viewers to "get your cat Fresh Step, before your cat gets fresh with you. "That was just about the cutest commercial I've ever seen," Dagenhardt said. "When the lady tried to fill the cat's box with a brand of litter that wasn't Fresh Step, the cat got all mad and put out its arm and said, 'Talk to the paw!' Dagenhardt enjoyed the computer-generated cat so much, later that evening she phoned her sister in Des Moines to ask if she had seen the commercial. "Yeah, I saw that one during Judging Amy! It really looks like the cat's talking! " sister Deborah Sayner said. "How do they make it do that? "Don't go there! " added Sayner, repeating the part of the commercial in which the sharp-tongued tabby warns its owner not to reach for a bargain-brand litter. After a lengthy discussion, the sisters came to the conclusion that the Fresh Step commercial was the best talking-animal ad they had seen since the one in which a group of brown bears sing "P-E-P-S-I" to the tune of "YMCA." They did note, however, that even though the antics of the Fresh Step cat are funnier, the Snuggle bear is cuter. According to Fresh Step spokeswoman Roberta Alt, the Dagenhardts are not alone in their positive response to the new ad. In extensive focus-group testing, it scored 45 percent higher than last year's Fresh Step campaign, in which a large cat, heartbroken over his owner's litter choice, wakes up the neighbors by mournfully singing "O Sole Meow." "Last year's 'Luciano Paw-varotti' spot was popular, but this one is even bigger," Alt said. "People really seem to love Fresh Step's new 'frank feline.' The cat's got attitude. Or, as we like to say, 'cattitude.'" Created by the San Francisco-based computer-animation firm Ocean 1, the ad's special effects cost $200,000. Total project expenditures for the funny-cat commercial were $245,000, but television air-time outlays are expected to bring the total cost of the campaign to $4.5 million, a sum Alt called "well worth it in gains to brand-name recognition. "We're currently developing other cheeky ads that humorously illustrate what might happen if you don't provide your pet with a premium cat litter like Fresh Step," Alt said. "Imagine a cat who rebels against his owner's cheap litter by donning a leather jacket, sunglasses and mohawk! Though Fresh Step's in-house creative team is still working on the new computer- generated cat's dialogue, Alt did confirm that the feline will utter the catchphrase, "Are you talking to me-ow?"

Stemke Family Murder Rate Lowest In 20 Years
BELVIDERE, IL–Though the overall rate of Stemke-family violent crime decreased only 10 percent in 1999, the Stemke murder rate has dropped to its lowest point in 20 years, Belvidere law-enforcement officials announced Monday. "Stemke-family homicide is still a concern, but, as these new statistics show, we've come a long way," said Belvidere police chief Lloyd Mortensen. "I don't think we'll see another 1979 again. Belvidere residents are cautiously optimistic about the news. "There's been a lot less killing since old Dale [Stemke] passed on, that's for sure," said Belvidere-area homeowner and real-estate agent Robert Dortmund. "But I still don't know how safe it really is. Winnebago County district attorney Gerald Fort attributed the decline to demographic shifts. "There are fewer 17- to 25-year-old Stemke males–the Stemkes most likely to commit homicide–than ever before. You just wait a couple years, when Bobby and John Lee get a little older. The Stemke-family murder rate hit an all-time high in November 1979, when, during an argument over Bill Stemke's drinking, Betty Stemke was hit on the head with a frying pan and died of massive brain hemorrhaging. In April of that year, Bud Stemke fatally stabbed brother Pete Stemke while arguing over the ownership of a hunting dog. Less than a month later, Paula Stemke shot sister Sue Stemke-Braunschweig after finding her in bed with Paula's fiancé, Earl Harris. "Our top priority has been to safeguard our citizens–Stemke and non-Stemke alike–from Stemke-related incidents in their homes, schools, and neighborhoods," Mortensen said. "When I became chief of police, I immediately began working to enact bold new initiatives to meet that challenge. Winnebago County is a safer place to live now because of our policies that get tough on Stemkes and keep violent Stemkes behind bars and off our streets. Figures kept by the Belvidere Police Department support Mortensen's claims. Since early 1999, there has been only one Stemke-family murder, in which Sophia Stemke beat her son Edward to death with a .22 rifle while reportedly attempting to "get him off his sister Bethany." Sophia was eventually able to plead her case down to second-degree Stemkeslaughter. Despite widespread excitement over Monday's announcement, some caution that the low figure is misleading. Jill Echols, president of the Stemke Community Action Coalition, said upwards of 40 percent of all Stemke-related deaths may go unreported each year, and that at least three of the nine unsolved homicides in Belvidere since 1976 are suspected of having some Stemke involvement. "Don't lose sight of the fact that Stemke crime did not decrease appreciably last year," Echols said. "There was a Stemke arrest for assault and battery once every three weeks last year. Domestic-disturbance calls, DUI arrests, and indecent exposure are up significantly, as well. We can't afford to relax.

Hedonistic Orgy Marred By Exclusively Overweight, Middle-Aged Participants
NORTH PLATTE, NE–"Aphrodite's Fantasy '99," a no-holds-barred, free-for-all orgy intended by organizers to be "a week-long carnal smorgasbord of wild, untamed sexual abandon and untold pleasures of the flesh," fell far short of its goal due to the exclusively middle-aged, overweight status of its participants, sources reported Monday. "Uh, I'd really rather not talk about that," said desk clerk Mustafa al-Aziz of the North Platte Budget Motor Lodge, which has hosted the annual event since 1995. "I think they come here because of our location just off the interstate, I don't know. To be honest, I try not to think about it too much. That's a mental image I just prefer not to have in my brain. The orgy, hosted by the 175-member, Omaha-based Cornhusker Couples' Connection Club, involved the rental of two of the motel's three floors and drew nearly four dozen couples from across Nebraska. Unfortunately, none of them even remotely resembled the sort of person with whom one would fantasize about having sex. "My Margaret and I look forward to this trip each year," said Karl Gustafson, 51, a semi-retired auto-insurance adjuster from Falls City who enjoys barbecues, Yahtzee and golf. "She's a dom into hot bi three-ways, and I enjoy getting [a form of anal/oral gratification] while strapped to a table in a rubber suit. "That used to be a bit iffy because of my irritable bowel syndrome," added Gustafson, his male-pattern baldness gleaming with the perspiration of his recent exertions. "But lately I've been taking these Fibercon dietary supplements, and it's made a heck of a difference. Look out, ladies, the wild man of Timberbrook Village Condominiums is back in action! " Though many of the participants somehow managed to greatly enjoy themselves, motel employees reported being notably non-titillated by the mass coupling of massive couples, which began Friday afternoon and is expected to continue through Thursday, barring stoppage due to hernias or fatigue. "I got a room-service call asking for extra cots, so I had no choice but to go up there," said part-time busboy and maintenance worker Mike Lipton, 19. "The guy came to the door wearing a feather boa, nipple clamps and some sort of tribal grass skirt. He looked just like my late Uncle Murray." According to nearby residents and police officials, ecstatic moans and screams could be heard coming from the building until well after 3 a.m. Saturday, causing them to feel vaguely queasy and, in some cases, experience nightmares. "They don't cause no trouble, so we let them do their thing," said North Platte police chief Reginald Burkett. "Whatever they need to do to get their rocks off. Still, I'd say most folks around here tend to give them a wide berth. In addition to local residents, a number of would-be participants also reported feeling uneasy with the event. Despite finding the idea of a marathon session of out-of-control group sex appealing in theory, several of those in attendance agreed that the reality of the situation failed to live up to their expectations. "My husband Eric and I thought this would be a good way to spice up our marriage a bit, because things have been rocky in that department ever since the baby was born," said a towel-clad Janet MacAlester, 29, standing amid 15 or 20 naked, lovemaking fiftysomethings while glancing around for a chance to bolt for the door. "Most of these people look like they came from some sort of church bazaar my parents would go to. I mean, some of them even brought a dish to pass. Growing increasingly nervous amid the writhing mass of sweaty, wheezing bodies, MacAlester repeatedly tapped the shoulder of husband Eric, who had become momentarily paralyzed with incredulity and fear by the sight of two elderly, obese couples attempting to remove each other's trusses.

Local Trailer Park Shatters No Stereotypes
TULSA, OK — Over the course of its 24-year history, Kilty's Kourt, a Tulsa-area trailer park, has shattered no stereotypes, causing no one to rethink any preconceptions about its coarse, poorly educated residents. "Very often, one forms a set of preconceived notions about a type of person based on generalizations, but then a closer examination of the individuals within the situation allows one to look beyond these stereotypes," said University of Oklahoma sociologist Dr. Terry Atkins, who recently completed an in-depth three-year study of the trailer park. "Such is not the case here, though: Kilty's Kourt is pretty much a depressing, disgusting place filled with total losers. Atkins had intended the study to challenge unfair, negative images of mobile-home dwellers by collecting statistical data that contradicts commonly held misconceptions. The professor's findings, however, only affirmed popular conceptions, with unemployment, sexual promiscuity and lack of education the norm among residents. Affirming widely held assumptions about trailer parks, Kilty's Kourt is little more than a muddy field filled with mobile homes in various states of disrepair. The blighted park is littered with rusted cars up on blocks, half-attached screen doors, makeshift clotheslines with laundry hanging untouched for weeks, and toppled TV antennas. Nor do the park's inhabitants — obese women who take notice of their filthy, pantsless children only long enough to scream at them; skinny, shirtless men who stink of McCormick vodka most of the day; a cadre of Ku Klux Klan sympathizers; and a sprinkling of clinically insane veterans — shatter any myths. "Based on all the stories I'd heard about trailer-park types, I expected to see the lowest of the low, people I wouldn't even want to look at, much less talk to," Atkins said. "I pretty much hit the nail right on the head. Atkins said he had also hoped that the study would give him a greater understanding of those who occupy a lower socioeconomic strata than himself, and vice-versa. "This project, in theory, afforded an upper-middle-class academic like myself the opportunity to build bridges with those of a culturally dissimilar background, enabling both me and them to gain a greater understanding and appreciation of the other's unique perspectives and experiences," he said. "Nope. Didn't happen. I did, however, have a lot of empty bottles thrown at me through missing windows. On his final day at Kilty's Kourt, Atkins was called "a fucking dead man" by one barefoot resident, threatened with a swinging hair dryer, and warned that he had "better stay away from White Jimmy's bitch. "They live like pigs," Atkins said. "Foul-mouthed, degenerate pigs. Members of the Tulsa Police Department may know Kilty's Kourt best of all, as they are called to the four-block area 20 to 30 times a week. "Just because a person isn't made of money doesn't mean they can't live their life with self-respect, gaining satisfaction and joy from simple things like the smile on a child's face, the beauty of a song, or the love of neighbors and friends," Tulsa police officer Joseph Lindgren said. "Unfortunately, no one like that lives in this place. "I once heard this joke about a white-trash mother, something about her four-year-old still breast-feeding," Lindgren continued. "I thought, 'That so-called 'humor' is just an offensive, discriminatory stereotype.' That was before I met Rhonda in 22." The most common charges, which Lindgren called "more or less right in line with what everyone would expect from people in a place like this," are drunken and disorderly conduct, wife battery, drug possession, illegal possession of a firearm and child neglect. "Just last night, the woman in 32 hit the guy in 18 over the head with a shovel and knocked him clean out," Lindgren said. "We had to haul both of them in. "What a shithole," he added.

She's Probably Sleeping With Him Right Now, Local Man Obsesses
CORVALLIS, OR — Given that she is not at her sister's, aunt's or best friend Erika's, was not at her desk any of the 12 times he phoned her at the office, and does not normally go grocery shopping until the weekend — not to mention the fact that she didn't come to the door either time he rang the doorbell and hid in the bushes, even though her bedroom light was on — area resident Kristin Mulcahy is probably sleeping with that guy at this very moment, local ex-boyfriend Andrew Wallace obsessed Monday. "I can just picture it," the profusely sweating Wallace told reporters. "His hands moving slowly over her soft, yielding breasts, gently stroking her into a state of breathless, ecstatic abandon, right there in the very bedroom where she first told me she loved me back in January 1998." Sources say Mulcahy, an Oregon State University comparative-literature graduate student and part-time library assistant, hasn't even spoken to Wallace since refusing to let him come in "even just for one minute" two Thursdays ago, fueling panicked speculation on the part of the heartbroken Wallace that Mulcahy was not, as she repeatedly insisted, alone, but was instead with "him," that guy with the sideburns with whom Wallace saw her at that art exhibit last month, and who probably owns the 1998 Isuzu Trooper that keeps showing up parked near Mulcahy's apartment at all hours of the night. "I poured my heart out to her, standing there in the rain on her front porch for 20 minutes, and now she won't even acknowledge that I exist," said Wallace, pausing briefly to stub out a cigarette in an overflowing ashtray nearby. "He was probably waiting right there in the other room the whole time, hearing every word of my desperate plea. Afterwards, once she'd slammed the door in my wet face, they probably laughed together about all the deeply personal things I was revealing about my innermost emotional needs. "I think his name is, like, Chris or Craig or Greg or something," Wallace said. "That smug, self-satisfied, woman-stealing, car-phone-talking, Third Eye Blind-CD-on-his-dashboard-leaving, sweater-vest-over-the-passenger-side-carseat-draping bastard! Mulcahy, whom Wallace has alternately described as "the most beautiful, intelligent, caring and special person I have ever met" and "a deeply selfish, spoiled brat who doesn't even care enough to answer the phone when someone who was once supposedly so important to her is sobbing on her answering machine, begging for just one more chance to show her that, together, they could make it work," has reportedly recovered well in the six weeks since her breakup with Wallace. "Kristin was a little upset about it at first," best friend Erika Duncan said. "But that's only to be expected. After all, she wasted more than a year and a half of her life on that simpering jerk what's-his-name. But she bounced back in no time, and I think she's made great strides in regaining her self-esteem. She's dating again and, from what I understand, her sex life is better than ever. "This new guy? " Duncan added. "Let's just say this: T-I-G-E-R, if you catch my drift. Wallace's efforts to achieve similar closure, however, have been hampered by the fact that whenever he shuts his eyes, images of his former beloved, screaming in pleasure as wave after wave of orgasmic ecstasy rocks her supple, nude body, dance mockingly across his inner eyelids. "I just know the son of a bitch is hung like a bear, too," Wallace said. "So I'm not the most well-endowed guy in the world, I admit it. Is that some kind of crime? According to sources close to Wallace, over the past six weeks he has had trouble sleeping, lost his appetite and suffered a drop in productivity at work. He has also frequently burst into tears at seemingly random moments, such as during TV commercials Wallace said "remind me of the times we shared. " In addition, he has created a shrine out of various mundane objects acquired during his time with Mulcahy, such as parking-garage stubs, grocery-store receipts and fast-food containers, keeping them as treasured mementos of his former partner. "Everyone tells me I have to 'accept it' and 'move on,'" said Wallace, locked in his bathroom in a fetal position with the lights off. "But how can I be expected to carry on as normal when at this very moment, less than 30 blocks from here, some stranger is putting his hands all over the only woman I've ever found true love with, driving her into a state of transcendent sexual bliss with his relentless pounding and pounding and thrusting and squirting and pounding, making her shiver and quake with sweet release? Huh? How am I supposed to just 'forget it' with all of that pounding going on, right now, at this very moment? Whether or not Mulcahy is actually sleeping with "him" at this very moment has not been confirmed.

Child Earns Clock Radio For 78 Hours Of Work
OMAHA, NE — Peter Hewson learned an important lesson about the value of hard work Monday and received an exciting reward at the same time, when the local 11-year-old earned his very own G.E. AM/FM digital clock radio by selling Continental Publishers Incorporated greeting cards — a learning experience that totalled just 78 hours of work. "I saw this ad in the back of a comic book," Peter said. "You could win all these prizes by selling cards, and one of them was a clock radio. "Peter had wanted a clock radio ever since he stayed at his grandma's, and there was one in the guest room," said Karen Hewson, the industrious youth's mother. "He really liked the idea of pop music waking him up. So when he saw a clock radio in the CPI catalogue, he was naturally very excited about the prospect of earning one of his very own. "Sure, we could have just gone to Shopko and bought him a much better clock radio for about $10," Karen said. "But how would he learn anything about life that way? Upon seeing the sales opportunity, an excited Peter filled out the attached enrollment form and mailed it that day. Six weeks later, he received his membership packet, which featured a welcome letter from CPI president Harmon Andruss, sales instructions, a sample folder, and an informative and entertaining "Door-To-Door Danny Wins Great Prizes The Fun Way!" comic book. Following the enclosed instructions, Peter toured his entire neighborhood, ringing doorbells and asking people if they wished to purchase greeting cards from CPI. For every order of $10 or more, Peter earned five "prize points" redeemable for exciting prizes from the CPI catalog. Every $20 order earned him 10 points. "I needed 200 points to get the radio," Peter said. "That's 22 boxes, so I really had to sell a lot of cards. Peter's long, hard road to the alarm clock was filled with obstacles. The first major setback occurred about two weeks into his door-to-door sales odyssey, when he had visited the last of the houses within walking distance and was still well short of the 200-point mark. "For a while, I kinda thought about giving up," Peter said. "But I wanted that clock radio really bad, so I started taking the city bus to other neighborhoods. And when I ran out of allowance money for the bus, I got jobs washing people's cars to get more money. According to Andrew Hewson, the boy's father, another difficult moment came about three weeks later. "One day, Peter came home crying because some old man had yelled at him," Andrew said. "Apparently, the guy was real busy when Peter rang his bell and he just spouted off at him. Peter told me he was sick of selling cards and didn't want to do it anymore. Continued Andrew: "I knew, though, that if I just let him give up, he'd never learn the importance of following through on things. So I gave him a long lecture about how hard life is and how people are going to yell at him every day when he has a real job. And I kept asking him if he wanted to go back and try for that radio, until he finally said yes. "That's my boy," Andrew said. "After that, the only real resistance I got from Peter was when he saw a much better clock radio than CPI offered for 75 cents at a yard sale. So determined was Peter to earn the clock radio, when he was just five prize points away, he used his leftover car-washing money to purchase $10 worth of cards himself, finally reaching the goal he had set some three months before. Just seven more weeks would pass before his prize arrived by mail. Factoring in the time he spent studying the materials, soliciting homes, filling out paperwork and delivering ordered cards, Peter calculated that he had devoted 78 hours to the project. "We are proud to have given young Peter a start on the road to adulthood and an exciting sales career," said CPI spokesman Sam Hurst. "It's hard-working young citizens like Peter that have made America the great country it is and have helped CPI become one of the nation's leading direct-sales corporations, boasting annual receipts of some $220 million last year. Peter, for his part, is just happy to finally have his clock radio. "Only the AM comes in, so all I can really hear is talk and news stations," he said. "I guess it's okay, though. But perhaps Peter's greatest reward is the pride he has given his parents, who know that their son can accomplish whatever he sets his mind to. "Peter's an achiever, that's for sure," a beaming Andrew said. "In fact, we were thinking of getting him into selling Grit magazine: There's a Bontempi table-top organ he has his eye on.

Man Who Didn't Get Joke Acts Like He Did
LAS CRUCES, NM — Comprehension of a joke involving Jeffrey Dahmer and Lorena Bobbitt was unsuccessfully feigned Monday, when area resident George Browner, 31, laughed along with tablemates at the Steaks Alive! eatery in Las Cruces. "Whoa! There you go," said the confused Browner, offering an intentionally vague response to what he suspected may have been the joke's punchline. "You got that right. " Browner added, "Well, she's sure crazy enough to do it," making his non-comprehension all the more obvious.

Please Stop Trying To Save Our Family Farm
Listen, I want to thank everyone for all the encouragement you've given us struggling farm families through the years. Everyone who attended all those Farm Aid concerts, that sure was nice of you. But really, that's enough now. I know you want to help preserve the rural way of life, but I have to ask you all something: Have you ever lived the rural way of life? Because, let me tell you, it sucks. It's hard, and it's dirty, and it's boring, so please stop trying to save our family farm. I grew up on the same piece of land my father did, and his father before him. Each morning, I've risen with the sun to the smell of earth and livestock. As far as the eye can see, there is grain, grain, endless waves of grain. And more grain. And still more fucking grain. Oh, God, how will I ever escape? Every day, I see bumper stickers on cars expressing support for the plight of our nation's farmers. But just as soon as I peel one off, they put another one right back on again the next day. Won't you please turn your back on us? Even though I was just a small boy at the time, I can remember the big drought that hit us in 1989. Times were so tough, we thought we were going to lose the farm for good. The bank was going to foreclose if we didn't have the long-overdue mortgage payment by morning. I stayed up the entire night praying, but to no avail. A group of townspeople organized just before sunrise and donated their own savings to make the payment. There was nothing I could do to stop them. As if that weren't bad enough, a few years later they all pitched in to sandbag the rising river. When the waters receded, they all went back to their air-conditioned apartments, and I went back to waking up at 5 a.m. every single day to milk the cows. Thanks a lot. Then, a few years ago, things were really looking up again. Crop prices were lower than ever. The bottom had dropped right out of the livestock market. The export situation was dire. But somehow, my dad managed to hold it all together through the bad times. Why, God, why? I can understand going out gracefully, but Dad goes way overboard with that dignity thing. He gets up at the crack of dawn and slaves until sundown. All out of a sense of pride. Nice fucking corn, Dad. Real straight rows, too. I'm real glad it makes you feel fulfilled. As for myself, I would have felt just fine if Dad would've sold the farm to that developer who wanted to put up a Target Greatland out here. Yeah, it sure would've sucked to have all that money laying around, Dad. I would've hated trading in our old rusty '79 Chevy truck for one of those imported SUVs. It would be pretty embarrassing to drive one of those 1999 Toyota 4-Runners around town, seeing how they aren't even made in America. Yeah, real fucking embarrassing. The land, the house, the silos — it'll all be mine someday, says pop. Yup, all those 40-year consolidated loans will all be mine. And then I'll be expected to stick to my guns and resist the corporate forces, too, or everyone will think I'm some sort of bastard. Shit, I'm 16 goddamn years old. I want to be in a rock band. I want to go to Indiana U. and spend spring break in Cancun. I want to live in a house with my friends Trevor and Jake, a house that has a couch on the front lawn and spray-paint scrawled on the sidewalk reading "Limp Bizkit" or "Fa$cism" or something. But, no. Here I am in the middle of nowhere, having the quintessential Heartland experience while those goddamn do-gooders in Washington are lobbying for greater farm subsidies. And the bank keeps letting Dad use this money pit as collateral so there's no way the bottom will fall out before I graduate from high school. As for all those letters to the editor you people write? Thanks a lot, everyone. Thanks a whole bunch. Why don't you spend your time saving the whales or the rainforests or the ozone layer or something. Just leave me the hell alone. Will Boyer, 16

Roommate All Into Cycling Now

"For the longest time it was fencing and now, like, from out of nowhere, there's all this cycling shit all over the apartment," Radzinski said. "There's two bikes in the front hallway, and he's got some kind of timer thing that he always leaves on the table. And I keep finding these little lycra racing outfits draped across the radiator. " Radzinski said he is jolted awake at 4:30 a.m. five times a week by the sound of Specht's alarm clock, which wakes the temporary cycling enthusiast for his morning ride. Specht's previous all-consuming interests include kayaking, black-and-white photography and home brewing.

Yeah, Borman finished his $4.99 Grand Slam breakfast already, but he can just sit there and read his placemat, it's no biggie.

Area Woman Has Already Figured Out Who Killed The Vicar
GREENSBORO, NC — Only three chapters into the Barbara Nelson Scott mystery thriller All Saints' Day, reader Mary Toback has already deduced the killer of Father Blaine, the Vicar of St. Mary's of Glasgow, it was reported Tuesday. "The angle of the stabs was consistent with a left-handed assailant," Toback told reporters. "And if you note the description of Bishop Argyll's desk on page 22, his quills are kept to the left of the writing tablet as he faces the desk. " Toback did not need to remind reporters that Argyll stands to benefit more than anyone from the appointment of MacGregor as the new Vicar.

Red-Lace Nightie Portends Another Excruciating Night For Closeted Husband
CLARKSTON, GA — A red-lace nightgown, barely covering area resident Amanda Yetter's body, sent waves of dread through husband and closeted homosexual Eric Yetter Friday. "I was coming home late from a long, tiring day at the office, and Amanda met me at the door wearing that red thing," said Yetter, 36, referring to the size-large, satin-trimmed, babydoll-style nightgown with matching ruffled thong bikini Amanda recently purchased at Victoria's Secret. "I immediately thought, 'Oh, God, here we go again.' Yetter, who has yet to admit his homosexual desires to himself, much less his wife, returned home at 10 p.m. expecting Amanda to be asleep. "When I pulled in the driveway, all the lights were all off, so I figured I'd be able to just relax and watch some TV," Yetter said. "But as it turned out, Amanda was waiting for me with the whole house lit up with candles and vanilla incense. Upon seeing his wife in the nightie, Yetter feared that the situation would lead to intercourse, which until that point he had managed to avoid for a record seven weeks. Panicked, he began searching for an excuse. "As Amanda unbuttoned my shirt, I tried to tell her that we'd wake up Eric Jr., but she said Grandma took him for the night so that we could finally spend some time alone," Yetter said. "Then I told her that I had to get up early to cut the grass, but she reminded me that the mower was broken. That's when I knew there was no way out. Yetter was led into the bedroom, where playing on the stereo was the CD compilation Pure Romance, an album he associates with a particularly unbearable Jan. 6 encounter with his wife involving mutual oral sex. After being instructed to kiss his wife all over, Yetter was then subjected to 23 minutes of marital relations. "Amanda complains that we don't have sex often enough, but she has to understand that I have a very high-pressure job," Yetter said. "And then there's church, which we're very involved with. Because of Yetter's strong Catholic faith, the couple abstained from sex until after their June 1995 wedding, an event that was originally scheduled for May 1993 but was delayed numerous times due to "extenuating circumstances. Amanda said that, overall, she is satisfied with her sex life. "I have to admit, it isn't exactly everything I've ever wanted, but it's normal for a couple's love life to fall off a bit as time goes by," she said. "Still, I just can't help but wish it was more like it was when we first got married. We were pretty crazy that first day or two! In addition to the infrequency of their coupling, Amanda expressed disappointment over her husband's habit of having a few drinks to "loosen up" to the point of inebriation before intercourse, as well as his tendency to face away from her during the act itself. "It'd be nice if he enjoyed it more, but you know how men are," Amanda said. "When you finally talk them into it, they just want to get in there, shut their eyes tight, and get it over with as quickly as possible. Added Amanda: "I'm hoping, though, that if I can be a more creative in the romance department, I can spice things up a bit. Maybe then, Eric won't spend so much time in his study with the door locked. With Friday's coital duties behind him, Yetter is now focusing on the couple's June 11 anniversary. "I hope Amanda doesn't expect us to go someplace romantic for the weekend," Yetter said. "A dinner out would be okay, but some secluded little bed-and-breakfast by the sea would be way too much. Amanda should know that sort of thing doesn't interest me.

Daddy Hitting Mommy With A Chair This Time
MURFREESBORO, TN — Noises coming from the living room indicate that Daddy is hitting Mommy with a chair this time, way-back-in-the-closet sources reported Tuesday. Use of the chair — a departure from Daddy's normal yelling, hitting and kicking routine — was attributed to the existence of all the dishes in the F-word sink, as well as various other complaints. During the incident, Daddy also raised allegations of marital infidelity, which Mommy categorically denied.

Area Man May Never Find Out If Condom In Wallet Is Still Good
OMAHA, NE — Donald Muller, a 33-year-old Omaha near-virgin, may never find out if the Ramses Extra Sensitive condom in his wallet is still good, it was reported Monday. "I really hope it hasn't deteriorated in the past three years," Muller said of the birth-control device, which was first inserted into his wallet in March 1996, prior to a St. Patrick's Day party that "didn't pan out. " "I don't really have any particularly strong leads right now, but it'd be nice to know I was prepared just in case anything came up. " Muller, who bought the condom in 1993 as part of a box of 12, said he hopes to strike up a conversation Sunday with a woman who uses the same laundromat as him.

13-Year-Old Girl Can't Believe How Immature Everyone Is
ORLANDO, FL — Disgusted with the total childishness of those around her, 13-year-old Alexis Keefe announced Monday that she can't believe how immature everyone is. "Everyone in the world is, like, so immature," said Keefe, rolling her eyes at a group of boys playing dodgeball during lunch recess. "I mean, when are people going to grow up? We're in eighth grade now, but everyone still runs around and plays baby games and acts completely retarded all the time. In addition to the juvenile behavior of her classmates, Keefe is forced to endure the immaturity of her younger sister, who doesn't even know what fractions are; the produce manager at the grocery store, who whistles constantly; the youth-group leader at her family's church, who wants everyone to hold hands like they're in nursery school; the clerk with all the buttons at Payless Shoes; and, worst of all, her parents. "My dad is always singing these dumb songs and telling stupid knock-knock jokes. I mean, get real. Knock-knock jokes? That is, like, so third grade," Keefe said. "Plus, he always calls pajamas 'PJs.' Excuse me? Her father, Richard Keefe, admitted that he does get "a little silly" sometimes, but stressed that he is making every effort to be respectful of his daughter's exceptional maturity. "Alexis is quickly becoming a young woman, so her mother and I are always trying to think of family activities that take this into account," Keefe said. "We've come to find that this excludes such infantile activities as holding family sing-alongs, getting Blizzards at Dairy Queen, watching Animal Planet, visiting Grandma, shopping at Sears, swimming at the public pool, going to the planetarium, playing Frisbee, and pretty much anything else that requires Alexis to leave her room or get out of the car. Even Keefe's best friends have come under fire for their immaturity. "I really like Becky [Christopher] and Jen [Ingrassia], but sometimes they're totally embarrassing to be around. I mean, Becky goes to karate class, and Jen listens to Z-96. How immature can you be? Added Keefe: "Sometimes I think Becky and Jen need to go back to Miss Schukal's kindergarten class or wear diapers or something. Among other things Keefe avoids at all costs: stuffed animals, pancakes, mittens as opposed to gloves, digital watches, pencils instead of pens, cotton candy, animated movies, sandals, yo-yos, ponytail holders, sack lunches and white nylons. "We should consider ourselves lucky to have such a discriminating individual in our midst," said Marjorie Schu, Keefe's guidance counselor at Eastlake Junior High School. "It was only two years ago that Alexis was a watchdog for all things that were 'boring,' and before that she was foremost in her class in pointing out things that were 'gay.'" "What will be next? " Schu asked. "Will she move on to combat the 'lameness' that surrounds her, or will she choose to speak out against things that are 'fake' or 'cheap'? I guess all we can do is wait and see.

Listener Consumed By Spittle On Corner Of Mouth
DOWNERS GROVE, IL — The words of area resident Pete Fargas were lost Saturday on listener Lois Dumas, who was rendered unable to concentrate due to a gob of spittle on the left corner of Fargas' mouth. "He kept talking, and I kept nodding, but I really couldn't focus on anything but the spittle," Dumas said. "I was just hoping he would eventually sense its presence and clear it away with his tongue, but he never did.

Area Man Gets New Phone, Cardboard Box, Bubble Wrap, Polystyrene Blocks, Plastic Bag, Twist Ties
LEESBURG, FL–Local consumer Jerome Bishop returned home from Radio Shack Tuesday with a newly purchased telephone, two polystyrene foam blocks, a protective plastic pouch, a heavy-duty corrugated cardboard box, three square feet of bubble wrap and twist ties. "The redial button on my old phone only worked if you pressed it really hard, so I had to throw it out," said Bishop, sifting through a pile of new-phone-related detritus covering his couch and living-room floor. "This new one should be much better. At approximately 5 p.m., Bishop began the 45-minute task of unwrapping the Radio Shack ET-290 Lighted Dial Trim-Fone, entombed deep within eight protective layers of packaging. Upon opening the outer cardboard box, he encountered a four-sided cardboard phone-mount which slid out after a pair of styrofoam product-stabilizing blocks were removed. After dismantling the inner cardboard mount, he discovered a freestanding polystyrene shell molded into the shape of the phone's handset and base, with two compartments for the phone's cord and optional wall-mounting screws, both of which were enclosed in factory-sealed miniature plastic baggies. Bishop then removed the polystyrene casing and cut through the underlying layer of protective bubble wrap, giving him access to the phone itself, which was housed in a multi-twist-tie-sealed plastic bag. "I like this new phone okay, I guess," said Bishop, trying out the white, two-piece unit featuring a backlit multifunction LCD display, dual keypads and an extra-long 10-foot cord. "It's kind of too bad about the other one, though–it was fine except for that one button. After setting up his new phone, Bishop tossed its box and inner packaging into a garbage bag, and also discarded the Radio Shack bag in which it was brought home. He did briefly keep the sheet of protective bubble wrap, spending several minutes meticulously popping the small air pockets between his thumb and forefinger before throwing it away. While disposing of the packaging, Bishop said he was careful to set aside the various pieces of literature which accompanied the phone, including a 48-page instruction manual, a booklet explaining the terms of the phone's 60-day limited warranty, the warranty certificate itself, a consumer-opinion reply card, a form for product registration, a catalog of other fine Radio Shack products and a Sprint promotional insert offering Sprint phone cards at a 15 percent discount. "I'd better look through this stuff before I throw it out with all that other stuff," Bishop said. "I'd hate to lose anything important. Attempts to reach production-line employees responsible for the packaging of the ET-290 Trim-Fone were unsuccessful. As of press time, all floor workers at the plant in Garland, TX, were occupied filling industrial-sized dumpsters with imperfectly molded plastic shells, miscut cardboard backings, undersized lengths of twist-tie wire, boxes with slightly smudged printing and five-cubic-foot balls of crumpled plastic wrap.

Still Too Soon To Masturbate Again, Local Man Decides
SMYRNA, GA–Citing his body's need for a brief rest period, as well as a desire to preserve some sense of personal dignity, Smyrna resident Gregg Reinisch announced Tuesday that it was "just a little too soon to masturbate again. "I already masturbated once tonight, since Just Shoot Me was a rerun, and I had, like, 20 minutes to kill before my pizza got here," the 27-year-old Reinisch told reporters an hour after his first masturbatory session. "I was gonna do it again, but I figured it would be kind of weird if I did it again so soon, so I decided to try to kill some time. But even after eating the pizza, watching NYPD Blue, moving the dry dishes from the dishrack to the cupboard, and removing his clothes from the dryer, Reinisch said he still did not feel like enough time had passed to respectably masturbate again. "I figured that if I did all that productive, housework-type stuff, I'd feel like I accomplished enough that I could masturbate without guilt," said Reinisch, pairing socks on his couch. "But I still feel like I need a little more non-sexual down-time before I can jack off again without damaging my sense of self-worth. If I wait just a little bit longer, it will be more special, and I'll respect myself more for it afterwards. Reinisch, who engages in manual penile self-stimulation five to seven times a week, said he would prefer not to masturbate again right away, but that circumstances have made another perfunctory self-induced climax all but inevitable. "I don't really feel like leaving the house, since it's after nine on a Tuesday. There's nothing on TV, I've played all my video games, I'm not hungry, and I have to work in the morning, so I can't get drunk," Reinisch said. "So basically, I've really got no choice. To minimize feelings of self-loathing during his next masturbation session, Reinisch said he plans to visualize an actual woman with whom he has socialized. "The first time I jerked off tonight, I used a photo of Joan Lunden in the latest issue of TV Guide for sexual stimulus," Reinisch said. "It did the trick, but it kind of made me feel like a loser. For my next bout, rather than use a picture of a celebrity, I will close my eyes and imagine someone I actually know–perhaps that cute blonde girl who works at the Blockbuster over on Sherman Road." Reinisch is also considering visualizing Nancy Quigley, his seventh-grade lab partner. "Once, I saw her panties, and I must've thought about that a thousand times during my early masturbation years, so that's always a reliable fantasy," Reinisch said. "But it's kind of creepy, if you think about it, because that means I'm getting off on looking up a 13-year-old girl's dress. So you can see how I'd be reluctant to exercise that option. Reinisch, who once went three full weeks without masturbating in 1989 due to a lack of privacy during a family vacation, first masturbated in the summer of 1985. Since then, observers say, he has self-induced an estimated 4,200 ejaculations. Reinisch stressed that his decision to forestall masturbation was based purely on his personal ethics regarding masturbational frequencies and in no way stemmed from any physical shortcomings. "Believe me, I am more than capable of masturbating twice within a short time-span," he said. "I don't have any problem performing in that area at all.

Romantic-Comedy Behavior Gets Real-Life Man Arrested
TORRANCE, CA — Denny Marzano, a 28-year-old Torrance man, was arrested Monday for engaging in the type of behavior found in romantic comedies. Marzano was taken into custody after violating a restraining order filed against him by Kellie Hamilton, 25, an attractive, unmarried kindergarten teacher who is new to the L.A. area. According to Hamilton, Marzano has stalked her for the past two months, spying on her, tapping her phone, serenading her with The Carpenters' "Close To You" at her place of employment, and tricking her into boarding Caribbean-bound jets. Hamilton made the call to police at approximately 7:30 p.m., when she discovered that the bearded cable repairman she had let into her apartment was actually Marzano in disguise. "Thank God he's in custody, and this nightmarish ordeal is finally over," said Hamilton, a single mother struggling to raise an adorable, towheaded boy all alone in the big city. "I repeatedly told him I wasn't interested, but he just kept resorting to crazier and crazier schemes to make me fall in love with him. Marzano, who broke his leg last week falling off a ladder leaning against Hamilton's second-story bedroom window, said he was "extremely surprised" that his plan to woo Hamilton had failed. "She was supposed to hate me at first but gradually be won over by my incredible persistence, telling me that no one has ever gone to such wild lengths to win her love," Marzano said. "But for some reason, her irritation never turned to affection. In addition to the stalking charges, Marzano is accused of framing Stuart Polian, a handsome Pasadena attorney and chief competitor for Hamilton's hand, for arson. Marzano denied the charge. "While it is true that I would love to have seen my main romantic rival out of the picture, I did not burn down that animal shelter and try to pin it on Mr. Polian," Marzano said. "I believe and have always believed I can win Kellie's love without resorting to such illegalities. Marzano had been arrested for engaging in romantic-comedy behavior on five previous occasions. The most recent arrest came in May 1998, when he pretended to be a confession-booth priest in the hopes of manipulating a Fresno, CA, woman into unwittingly revealing her love for him.

Area Man Forces Self To Drink Another Free Refill
ERIE, PA–Local fast-food consumer Don Turnbee forced himself to drink another free refill Tuesday, despite the fact that he had already consumed three small soft drinks and was no longer thirsty, Burger King outlet #4579 sources reported. According to Turnbee, known throughout the Erie area for his reliance on local fast-food outlets for convenient, delicious meals at a reasonable price, the decision to consume a third free refill was motivated by financial considerations. "I didn't really want another Mello Yello, but I went ahead and refilled my cup anyway, because it was free," said Turnbee, addressing reporters near the self-service soda fountain conveniently located in Burger King's dining area. "With all that free soda just sitting there unused, it just seemed like not having another soda would've been a big waste. According to lunch-rush sources, Turnbee's decision to order a small soft drink rather than his traditional large was largely motivated by the restaurant's refill policy. "He wanted a large, but I told him if he was drinking it in the store he might as well just get a small since there's free refills," cashier Anthony Funderburke, 16, said. "He looked at me with this confused look for a few seconds, but once he understood what I meant, he was like, okay, he'd have the small then. By purchasing the 94-cent small soda rather than the $1.09 large, Turnbee saved 15 cents–not to mention the subsequent savings generated by his exploitation of store refill policy. "I had a small Mello Yello, a small Coke, a small Mr. Pibb, and then another small Mello Yello, all for the price of only one small soft drink," said Turnbee, pausing to belch slightly. "That's a bargain, if you think about it. In addition to the financial incentives to drink more soda, experts believe the psychological allure of controlling one's own soda-refill destiny contributed to Turnbee's four-drink visit. "Many fast-food establishments offer free refills. But unlike Burger King, restaurants like McDonald's and Arby's require you to ask one of the uniformed workers to get it for you, because the soda fountains are behind the counter," said commentator H. Nelson Brubaker, author of Why We Refill: The American Soda Experience Examined. "In such instances, customers like Turnbee will generally only have one medium or large beverage and then leave it at that, simply because the idea of free refills is less attractive to them when another human is involved in the process. Brubaker also noted that federal health regulations–which require employees of fast-food restaurants to ask the customer to remove the lid themselves before the employee can take the cup and refill it, in order to minimize contact between the employee's hands and the cup's rim, or "drinking surface"–can create an unsavory set of associations in customers' minds, further decreasing the likelihood of free-refill optioning. "But at Burger King," Brubaker said, "where the fountain is right out in the open and anybody can access it, the dynamics of the soda-refill process are left entirely in the hands of autonomous customers like Mr. Turnbee. The sense of personal power and responsibility created by such unfettered access to a limitless soda source can sometimes be a bit overwhelming, leading to reckless overuse and excessive refilling–even when, as in this case, it is not warranted from a thirst-based perspective. Turnbee acknowledged that the sense of power he derived from being in control of his own soda options "may have gone to my head. "Every time I got a refill, I dumped out the ice and got more, newer ice," Turnbee said. "There wasn't really any reason to do that, since my old ice hadn't melted yet and was still perfectly good. But I just figured, 'They've got plenty more ice, so why not?' Plus, I liked pressing the little lever on the ice-dispenser machine and hearing the loud clunking sounds it made. At one point, Turnbee experimented with the soda fountain at length, creating an "Omni-Soda" mixture of all five available brands. Upon tasting the Omni-Soda and deciding it did not appeal to him, Turnbee dumped the experimental blend into the soda fountain's drainage trough and refilled his cup with Mr. Pibb. The refill cycle was finally brought to an end when Turnbee got up to use the restroom, returning to find his tray cleared by restaurant personnel. "I really had to go to the bathroom bad," Turnbee said. "Then, when I was gone, they threw my cup away. I couldn't get any more refills after that, because I had no cup. I didn't mind, though: Since I had four, I'd already saved a lot of money. Despite Turnbee's satisfaction with his savings, according to one expert, he did not actually enjoy a substantial discount at all. "Soda of the variety Mr. Turnbee is talking about costs Burger King approximately 3 cents per gallon and is sold at a 25,000 percent markup," fast-food-industry analyst Wilson Anderson said. "Thus, when Mr. Turnbee purchases a 16-ounce cup for 94 cents and refills it three times, he is not actually getting a significantly better value than the consumer who does not refill at all. In fact, he would have to drink more than 250 refills to get his 94 cents' worth.

Borrowed CD Slowly Integrated Into Own Collection
OLYMPIA, WA — An Elvis Costello CD belonging to area resident Jonathan Wagner, 24, has entered the final stage of de facto ownership by friend Doug Alland, sources reported Tuesday. "For the first four or five days, I kept Jon's copy of Blood & Chocolate alone on top of my CD player," Alland, 23, said. "Then, for about a week and a half, I had it next to a stack of my own CDs that I'd been listening to. " Alland said he then worked the album into the adjacent stack, eventually filing it away in his own CD shelf, where it will remain permanently, unless Wagner specifically asks for it back. "I'm way more into that album than Jon is, anyway," said Alland, defending the gradual acquisition. "He barely ever even played it.

Bar Mitzvah Marks Local Boy's Passage Into Materialism
BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MI — Thirteen-year-old Joshua Nussbaum of Bloomfield Hills became a full-fledged consumer Saturday upon the event of his Bar Mitzvah, the traditional Jewish ceremony and subsequent extravagant catered affair that marks a boy's passage into materialism. "From this day forth, I shall acquire wealth and goods in the venerated tradition of my fathers," Nussbaum said during the five-hour, $18,000 reception, which featured a live band, a professional balloon-animal artist, and a video retrospective of his life on a big-screen TV purchased for the occasion. Added Nussbaum, who collected more than $21,000 in Bar Mitzvah gifts and cash: "Today, I am a consumer.

Area Man Way Too Into Local County History
LEWANAHO COUNTY, WI — Gary Pavlik, an assistant librarian at the public library in Vida, the seat of Lewanaho County, is way too into local county history, sources reported Monday. "Up until about 1890, Lewanaho County was famed across north-central Wisconsin for its sugar-beet production," said Pavlik, 37, the county's unofficial historian. "But two factors put an end to its predominance: a blight which wiped out much of the beet crop in 1891 and 1893, and a growing interest in cranberry farming, which was ideal for Lewanaho County's vast tracts of marshy land. Incidentally, I should mention that the blight was bacterial in origin, and not a fungus, as some of the old-timers in our community would have you believe. Vida resident Eleanor Sloane, 66, who has known Pavlik since he was a boy, said he has always had a passion for Lewanaho County history. "At first, I thought Gary's hobby was a positive thing, since girls didn't seem much interested in him and he needed something to occupy his time," Sloane said. "And it still is positive, in many respects. But numbering and cataloguing each plank of wood in the Swilley's Creek covered bridge off Highway PD, and then determining which sawmill each plank came from? That's just sad. Said Pavlik: "An interesting thing to note about the covered bridge at Swilley's Creek is that it was built by a construction company that was once owned by the third cousin once-removed of the great-grandfather of — you guessed it — Eleanor Sloane. I should also mention that at the time the bridge was built, 1892, the cousin, Ekvind Solberg, had sold his company to Alfred F. Griebel, who would later become county supervisor. Upon its sale, Ekvind joined his brother Anders to manage his grain elevator in nearby Plovis, which did a modestly successful business before eventually shutting down in the early 1960s." Pavlik's latest project is studying the life and work of Leopold Berlot, Lewanaho County's first Belgian and the inventor of an early prototype of the modern bicycle, a five-wheeled, hand-pedaled contraption called the "pentacopede." "Sadly, Berlot's invention failed to catch on among the general public, and he soon returned to farming," said Pavlik, who has tracked down and interviewed more than two dozen descendants of Berlot. "Holder of some 30-odd patents, good old Leopold was one of the more colorful characters in Lewanaho County history, that's for certain. Pavlik is also an avid preservationist, having saved over 75 volumes of court dockets, some dating back as far as the 1870s, from the Lewanaho County Courthouse upon discovering that they were earmarked for incineration. He subsequently donated the dockets to the Lewanaho County Historical Society. "We were touched by Gary's generosity, but, unfortunately, we really didn't have a place for them," said Catherine Ernst, director of the Lewanaho County Historical Society. "We've been hard-pressed for space lately, and Gary's donation of 77 thick, oversized leather-bound ledgers only complicated matters. Pavlik said citizens of Lewanaho County "can rest well" knowing that he is hard at work preserving their rich heritage. "It's astonishing how many notable things have taken place right here in our own county over the years," Pavlik said. "The best part is, there's always something new to learn. "Gary knows everything about us," Vida resident Dick Switzer said. "Where and when we were born, what we did for a living, who we married, how many children we had. It's really pretty creepy. Pavlik's latest book, the 968-page A Short History Of Lewanaho County, Wisconsin, published by Pavlik Press, is available at the Lewanaho County Historical Society and nowhere else.

Police Baffled By Bottle-Shaped Paper Bag
BRIDGEPORT, CT — Local police officials are "utterly baffled" by a bottle-shaped paper bag that local resident Jimmy Kilty held while sitting on an East Side strip-mall bench Monday. "It's a real mystery," said Sgt. Ted Vittorio of the Bridgeport Police Department. "Judging from the way he kept putting the paper bag up to his mouth, you'd think he was drinking something out of it. But obviously he wasn't, since paper can't hold liquid. It would soak right through instantly. Vittorio said he was making his normal patrol of the area when he noticed Kilty clutching the strange bag. "It's part of my job to monitor for loitering and public intoxication, so when I spotted Kilty sitting on the bench, I slowed down to survey the scene," Vittorio said. "I thought maybe he was drinking, but, as it turned out, he was just repeatedly putting a paper bag up to his face. Such behavior may be strange, but it's certainly not illegal, so I moved on. Kilty, 32, who remains on the bench as of press time, reportedly spent his first three hours greeting passersby. At approximately 4:15 p.m., he was joined by two male companions, who intermittently held the paper bag and took turns disappearing behind the thick hedges that border the parking lot. With so few leads, police can only speculate as to what the bag contains. "Whatever's in there, it's got to be pretty heavy, because otherwise why would the men need to take turns holding it? " police chief Edgar Rudolph said. "And we know it's not liquor, because everyone in town is well aware of Bridgeport City Ordinance Title 9, Chapter 4, Article 4, which clearly states that it is unlawful for any person within city limits to possess any alcoholic beverage in any public place, or to transport any alcoholic beverage upon any public street, sidewalk, pedestrian mall, alleyway or thoroughfare where such alcoholic beverage is in a receptacle which has been opened, or the seal of which has been broken, or the contents of which have been partially removed. "Besides," Rudolph continued, "just for the sake of argument, let's say that those men were willing to risk arrest and a $110 fine for public drinking. They certainly would have taken the extra 10 seconds to make it a little less obvious by simply pouring the alcohol into a soda can or paper cup or something. No one could be that stupid.

Area Man Confounded By Buffet Procedure
ERIE, PA — Area resident Don Turnbee was "completely bewildered" by standard buffet protocol at the East Frontage Road Ponderosa Steakhouse, sources close to the 37-year-old eater reported Tuesday. Turnbee, who ordinarily relies on Burger King, McDonald's and other fast-food establishments for his nutritional-intake needs, was confused by procedures regarding Ponderosa's "$6.99 Grand Dinner Buffet." Among his uncertainties: when to pay for the meal, which food items he had unlimited access to, whether soft-drink refills were free, and whether to move around the various serving stations in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. "There was a lot of different stuff you had to know," Turnbee said. "I wasn't sure if I was doing it right. Ponderosa patrons reported seeing Turnbee wander aimlessly for 20 to 30 minutes through the restaurant's all-you-can-eat buffet area, which features more than 75 choices of hot and cold appetizers, salad items, fresh fruits and pasta, as well as a "No Stopping The Toppings" dessert/sundae bar. "It's pretty confusing. They need to put up some signs explaining how everything works," Turnbee said. "At Taco Bell, at least they have railings so you know where to walk. According to Ponderosa cashier Liz Rutt, Turnbee was disoriented from the moment he walked in the door. "He was looking up at the big menu for like 10 minutes and then went over by the window for a while, just looking really lost," Rutt said. "Finally, I was like, 'Can I help you? You need to order before you can be seated.' Once seated in a booth, Turnbee waited for a server to bring him a plate for the buffet. Finally, after 10 minutes, he approached a server from another section, who informed him that plates were located next to the buffet and that he could "go ahead whenever you're ready. More confusion awaited Turnbee at the buffet itself. "There was a big table with vegetables and mashed potatoes and all that, but then there were these other little sections off to the side with soup and Mexican food and desserts," Turnbee said. "I know at Wendy's you have to pay extra for the soup and potato bar, so I didn't know for sure which things I could have. "I tried to watch what other people were taking," he added, "but I wasn't sure if they'd gotten the same buffet deal as me or if they'd gotten some other deal that gave them special access to that stuff. Turnbee eventually found an elderly woman near the macaroni salad and asked her which items he could eat. "She told me I could have as much as I wanted of anything in the whole buffet area," Turnbee said. "I was really happy about that, because there were a lot of things I wanted that I'd thought I couldn't get, like the tacos. Even after determining what he could eat, however, Turnbee continued to struggle. Uncertain "what food went with what," Turnbee's first trip to the buffet resulted in a plateful of spaghetti covered in nacho-cheese sauce, a taco dressed with cottage cheese and fish wedges dipped in lentil soup. Though not confirmed as of press time, it is also believed that Turnbee topped a Sloppy Joe sandwich with several large dollops of sour cream. Still more trouble came when Turnbee made his first return trip to the buffet. While serving himself buffalo wings, he drew disapproving glares from other buffet patrons before noticing a sign reading, "Please Take A Clean Plate Before Each Trip To The Buffet." "They put that sign in a really bad place," said Turnbee, defending his use of the dirty plate. "It's right by the clean plates, so the only way you'd see is if you were already getting a clean plate, anyway. Among Turnbee's other violations of Ponderosa buffet protocol: grabbing rolls without using the provided plastic tongs, using a soup bowl for his ice cream, spilling shredded carrots into the garbanzo beans, and letting the rice pilaf's cover fall into the alfredo sauce. "The whole time, I really tried to be careful," Turnbee said. "Like, I didn't know if I could cut in by the hot bar, so I just waited in line through all the salad items just to get at the macaroni and cheese way down at the end. But even still, I wound up making all these mistakes. It's a really confusing set-up." Architect Randall Kouris, who in 1986 drafted the dining-area plan now standard to all Ponderosa franchises, stood behind his design, insisting that the series of smaller buffet islands is not intended to confuse guests but rather to create a homier, less "cafeteria-ish" atmosphere. "After extensive tests, it was clear that restaurant patrons found this layout much easier to navigate than the traditional cafeteria-style, single-island buffet," Kouris said. "I am truly sorry that Mr. Turnbee had problems with our set-up, but, as I said, most customers seem to greatly prefer it. Despite Turnbee's difficulties, Ponderosa officials expressed confidence that, in time, he could master the intricacies of the restaurant's buffet. "The problems Mr. Turnbee encountered are simply the result of unfamiliarity, and I believe it is well within his power to acclimate himself to our system," said Larry Chynoweth, manager of the East Frontage Road Ponderosa. "I would urge Mr. Turnbee to give us another chance and find out just how great the Ponderosa dining experience can be. Turnbee said it is doubtful he will become a regular customer of the chain. "The food was really good, and I got a lot for my money, but it's just too complicated," he said.

Manifesto Coming Along Fine
LIBBY, MT — Ken Hausch, a Libby-area Luddite separatist and conspiracy theorist, announced Monday that his much-anticipated manifesto, My Lonely Battle Against The Mind-Control Slavery Of The Illuminati And Its Footmen In The CIA, KGB, U.N., Vatican, NASA, IRS, AT&T, Federal Reserve, Disney, The Order Of Skull & Bones, And The Rosicrucians, is "coming along fine" and should be completed by fall of this year. "So far, so good," the unemployed, one-time University of Washington physics graduate student said. "Right now, I've got about 14,600 pretty solid pages in the can, with probably fewer than 5,000 to go. Once that's done, it'll just be a matter of double-checking the facts, tightening up the writing and making sure the whole thing's got a nice, cohesive flow. Though reluctant to reveal details about the manifesto, Hausch said it reveals the "whole and real truth" about a master plan by world governments and multinational corporations to brainwash and enslave all of humanity through the use of top-secret artificial-intelligence and aerospace technology. "There's some very good stuff in there. Honestly, I'm really pleased with the way it's turning out," Hausch, 39, said. "I'm not saying it's the best manifesto that's ever been written, but I do think I have reason to be proud. Despite his excitement, Hausch said he has yet to let anyone see the work. "I know it would be helpful to have someone else read it, just to get a fresh perspective, but I'm really bashful about letting people see stuff I'm working on before it's 100 percent finished," Hausch said.

Manifesto Coming Along Fine
LIBBY, MT — Ken Hausch, a Libby-area Luddite separatist and conspiracy theorist, announced Monday that his much-anticipated manifesto, My Lonely Battle Against The Mind-Control Slavery Of The Illuminati And Its Footmen In The CIA, KGB, U.N., Vatican, NASA, IRS, AT&T, Federal Reserve, Disney, The Order Of Skull & Bones, And The Rosicrucians, is "coming along fine" and should be completed by fall of this year. "So far, so good," the unemployed, one-time University of Washington physics graduate student said. "Right now, I've got about 14,600 pretty solid pages in the can, with probably fewer than 5,000 to go. Once that's done, it'll just be a matter of double-checking the facts, tightening up the writing and making sure the whole thing's got a nice, cohesive flow. Though reluctant to reveal details about the manifesto, Hausch said it reveals the "whole and real truth" about a master plan by world governments and multinational corporations to brainwash and enslave all of humanity through the use of top-secret artificial-intelligence and aerospace technology. "There's some very good stuff in there. Honestly, I'm really pleased with the way it's turning out," Hausch, 39, said. "I'm not saying it's the best manifesto that's ever been written, but I do think I have reason to be proud. Despite his excitement, Hausch said he has yet to let anyone see the work. "I know it would be helpful to have someone else read it, just to get a fresh perspective, but I'm really bashful about letting people see stuff I'm working on before it's 100 percent finished," Hausch said. "Plus, I don't want to run the risk of showing it to someone who turns out to be one of the Illuminati's countless servile minions.

Area Man Reduced To This
CORBIN, KY–Local food-service worker Earl Baxter was reduced to this Tuesday, when a Hardee's customer lost a metal bracelet in the restaurant's dumpster and Baxter's manager instructed him to retrieve it. "So, this is how far I've come," said Baxter, wading through the giant trash receptacle in search of the mislaid bauble. "I'm actually reduced to this. " His arms blackened to the elbows by coffee grounds, Baxter noted that he could have been a mechanic earning $30,000 a year by now, had he gone to trade school. "Woulda gotten me outta this," said the reduced-to-this Baxter.

Customer Awkwardly Accepts One Cent, Receipt
BERKELEY, CA — Coffeehouse patron Lenny Niyo awkwardly accepted one cent and a receipt Monday after purchasing a $1.99 biscotti. "It made me feel kind of cheap, standing there waiting for six or seven seconds while the receipt printed out and the cashier put away my singles and got the penny, but it would have looked weird if I'd just walked away, too," Niyo said. "It's not like I wanted the receipt. I was sure the biscotti would work out fine.

Area Man Settled For
FAYETTEVILLE, AR — After nearly 20 years of unsuccessfully attempting to court and marry an interesting, attractive man, 41-year-old Sandra Browner of Fayetteville settled Monday for insipid, pie-faced screen-door-factory worker Willard Kurtz. "He's a real sweet guy," Browner said of her new fiancé, who is insisting on a sports-themed wedding reception to be held in March at the Fayetteville-area Hooters owned by his cousin Ed. "And he's got very nice hands. " The couple will live with Kurtz's aunt until things start taking off at the factory.

New Yorker Subscriber Considering Bose Wave Radio Purchase
MAMARONECK, NY–According to reports, Mamaroneck-area New Yorker reader Cal Tillinghast is strongly considering the purchase of a Bose Wave radio. The 49-year-old Tillinghast, associate curator of special exhibits for the Whitney Museum, was moved to consider purchasing a Bose Wave radio after spotting an ad for the distinctively curved piece of sound equipment on page 47 of the September issue of The New Yorker. "I was looking for the Talk Of The Town page when an ad for a most unusual product caught my eye," Tillinghast said. "Could the compact Bose Wave radio, with its patented acoustic waveguide, really produce room-filling sound at the touch of a button? I was intrigued, to say the least. After reading the ad, Tillinghast returned to his general browsing of the magazine, enjoying several book reviews and the Shouts & Murmurs page while sipping a glass of wine brought to him by his wife Eleanor. Before long, however, Tillinghast was overwhelmed by an urge to return to the ad. "I was reading a wonderfully droll Henry Beard piece about cats, but all I could think about was that Bose Wave radio," said Tillinghast, pausing to remove his reading glasses. "The prospect of enjoying my favorite Mahler symphony in concert-hall-quality sound right in the comfort of my own living room was simply too enticing to ignore. Added Tillinghast: "Not only is the Bose Wave radio small enough to fit anywhere, it's available in imperial white or graphite gray and comes complete with a credit-card-sized remote. Tillinghast, a New Yorker subscriber for more than 20 years, has on numerous occasions learned of revolutionary new products through the magazine. Among the products he has discovered: a light-up "Starry Night" pillow that brings the Van Gogh masterpiece to life, mail-order filet mignons from Omaha Steaks, a Fujiyama 2 ceramic pen, a 14K gold turtle pin, a Hammacher Schlemmer shaving set, and a remarkable Swim At Home 8' x 15' "Endless Pool." "I also found a book light that clips right on to whatever you're reading," added Tillinghast. "It's been quite useful. But of all the products Tillinghast has seen advertised in The New Yorker, none has captured his imagination like the Bose Wave radio. "Mind you, this is no normal radio–they won an award for it," said Tillinghast, referring to the Popular Science "Best Of What's New" award presented to Bose four years ago. Tillinghast said he is "99 percent certain" he will purchase the Bose Wave radio, but is taking time to consider all factors before making a final decision. "At $349, it is a bit pricey for just a radio," he said. "But it would certainly make a wonderful conversation piece. And Eleanor would doubtless enjoy using it to listen to All Things Considered while doing the puzzle. Tillinghast said he feels pressure to decide soon. "If I order by the end of the month, I get free shipping, which is always nice," he said. "In reality, though, I have even less time to decide, because Eleanor and I leave for Luxor on the 26th." "I suppose I'll think it over a few more days," Tillinghast said. "Then again, what do I have to lose? I can return it within 30 days if I'm not simply amazed by the sound.

Huge Animal Jumps Right Fucking Out In Front Of Area Man
MOORHEAD, MN–Moorhead resident Carl Perry damn near shit himself Monday, when a big-ass animal jumped right the fuck out in front of his Chevy pick-up. According to reports, the 41-year-old Perry was driving on Highway C to Ed's Tavern when the huge fucking thing jumped right the fuck out in front of him from out of nowhere. Though the animal, described by witnesses as a big-old son of a bitch with these weird-looking horns, jumped clear of the vehicle before collision, the fuck was scared out of Perry.

Local Teen 'Definitely' Going To Burning Man Next Year
LONGMONT, CO–Addressing a group of fellow Carver High School students assembled in the school's commons area, 17-year-old Todd Kelso announced Monday that he is "definitely" going to Burning Man next year. "There's no way I'm gonna miss Burning Man next year," Kelso said of the annual week-long gathering in Nevada's Black Rock Desert, held Aug. 31-Sept. 7 this year. "It's the coolest fuckin' thing ever, man–I heard from this guy that all these naked chicks dance around in silver body paint, and there's this 50-foot floating couch that has lasers coming out of it. It's like this whole alternative community. Kelso, who was unable to attend this year's event due to transportation problems, first learned of Burning Man in September 1997, when MTV News anchor Kurt Loder delivered a live, on-location report from the festival. Ever since seeing the MTV segment, Kelso has been committed to attending the festival. "All these really cool people drive out to the middle of the desert to smoke weed and set this big huge statue on fire," Kelso said. "But it's not about acting all crazy. It's about getting in touch with your primal roots. It's about creating this whole other way of living in this alternate community. Plus, supposedly, there's a fire-breathing car that looks like a shark. Added Kelso: "It's gonna be so awesome. Already preparing for next year's event, Kelso said he is setting aside $5 from each paycheck from his bagboy job at Pic-N-Sav for the $100 Burning Man admission fee. He is earmarking an additional $5 from each paycheck for much-needed repairs for his 1982 Chevy Chevette. Kelso has also begun giving serious consideration to his choice of costume. "I was thinking about going in some kinda crazy outfit with Christmas lights," he said, "or maybe something with big metal spikes like in The Road Warrior." Added Kelso: "I think I'm going to cover my whole car in aluminum foil. Kelso, who said he expects next year's Burning Man to be "twice as insane" as this year's, has already invited his best friend, Carver High School junior Matt Fleischer, to come along. t "I don't know too much about it, but I'm up for anything," said Fleischer, who has already agreed to pitch in half the gas money. "From what Todd says, it sounds seriously out of control. According to Kelso, Fleischer is the only Carver High student he could ask to accompany him to Burning Man. "Anyone else at this school would totally freak over a scene like that," Kelso said. "But me and Matt are mature enough to handle it. Plus, the girls at Burning Man are supposed to be way more sexually liberated than the ones at Carver. The chicks here suck. "Burning Man is going to be mind-blowing. And I'll be 18 next summer, so I won't have to answer to anyone," said Kelso, heading to his fifth-period algebra class. "I missed out big-time this year, but there's no way I'm going to make the same mistake next year. No fucking way.

New Pen Brings Fleeting Moment Of Satisfaction To Local Man
HARTFORD, CT–Duane Grunfeld, a 44-year-old Hartford-area insurance-claims processor, experienced a passing moment of satisfaction in his otherwise agonized existence Tuesday when he purchased a new pen. "It's a nice pen–smooth-writing and easy on the hand," Grunfeld said of the $2.79 UniBall Gel Writer XT he purchased during his allotted 30-minute lunch break. With its retractable fine point and rubberized grip, the quality pen briefly helped Grunfeld forget about his thinning hair, the severe reprimand he received from his supervisor Monday for tardiness, and the Aug. 11 death of his only companion, a 9-year-old parakeet named Mr. Whistles. "It's got a really nice feel when you click it," Grunfeld said during his three minutes of pen-induced solace. "I like how the body is made of clear plastic, so you can see the springs inside. Added the spiritually broken Grunfeld: "The ink seems really sharp, too. Pens of this kind often tend to bleed. Grunfeld, a longtime widower who has been passed over for promotion six times during his 10 years with Hartford's TriState Mutual Insurance, said he purchased the UniBall Gel Writer to cheer himself up after "a particularly tough morning at work. "Let's just say things weren't going well," Grunfeld said, "so I decided to treat myself to something nice. Also factoring in the decision to purchase the pen, Grunfeld said, was the cramping he had recently been suffering in his writing hand. "The claim forms I process all day long have to be filled out in quadruplicate, so my choice of writing instrument is important," he said. "TriState provides Bics for its employees, but with those cheap ballpoints, you have to press pretty hard. Grunfeld made his purchase at a local office-supply store, where he reportedly tested over two dozen pens for fluidity, ease of use, hand comfort and overall "writing feel. " After trying out pens for 10 minutes on the small scratch pads provided by the various pen manufacturers, the clinically depressed Grunfeld settled on the UniBall Gel Writer. Grunfeld then returned to his office cubicle and broke out the newly purchased pen. "It writes through all four forms with a lot less pressure," said Grunfeld, using the pen moments before returning to his usual deep malaise. "I could process claims all day with this pen.

Crazy Man Announces Plans To Stand In Doorway, Yell At Cars All Day
ALHAMBRA, CA — Area crazy man Dennis Fife held a press conference Tuesday to announce that on Oct. 8, he will stand in the doorway of the office building at 2600 Kenilworth Avenue and yell at cars all day. Addressing reporters, the 47-year-old Fife said, "At approximately 9:30 a.m. on the day in question, shortly after I finish lunging at dogs, I will proceed to the front steps of the Simmons Building and yell loudly for nine hours. The screaming will be broken by a 15-minute fit of rigid catatonia, most likely in the late afternoon. Among the topics Fife plans to address during his nine-hour rant: the ace of diamonds, bookshelves, the man trying to kill him, those goddamn bananas, people from St. Louis, closed-up straws, Trapper John, MD, and papers, papers everywhere. "I may briefly stray from my agenda to urinate into the revolving door at the building's entrance," Fife said, "but, for the most part, I will focus on the task at hand and spend the bulk of the day yelling at the various passing cars. Though Fife said he will shout at any vehicle that goes down Kenilworth Avenue, he will focus primarily on Volkswagen Beetles, pick-up trucks and late-'80s Mitsubishi Galants. Fife also noted that he will attempt to gain the attention of bicyclists by shouting, "Hey there, Mr. Bike-man." "A lot of what I intend to yell will be pre-planned — it will be things I've shouted at cars before," said Fife, chewing on his right forearm. "But I definitely want to leave open some room for improvisation. For instance, if a red car passes by, I might be inclined to shout at the driver, 'Where'd you get the fancy red car?' But then, if another red car drives by a bit later, I might become angry and demand that the driver stop and give me kidney beans. Fife has already begun preparations for the event. On Monday, he worked late into the night making a bowl of Kraft macaroni and cheese, which he said he will bring with him and throw into the street, handfuls at a time. He has also set aside his lucky rubberband and a tree branch for the occasion. While Fife has vowed to remain in the office building's doorway throughout his nine-hour yell session, some observers speculate that he will wander over to the nearest corner, where he would have access to vehicles slowing down to make the turn onto Canyon Drive. "That corner is going to be extremely tempting for Mr. Fife," Alhambra city councilmember Lorraine Schmidt said. "Not only do the cars slow down there, giving him better access to drivers, but there is a mailbox he can spit into. I can't imagine he'll be able to stand in that doorway all day with the corner in full view without giving in to the urge to go over there. Alhambra police chief George Jaeger predicted Fife would be successful in his venture, praising his remarkable tenacity and determination. "When Mr. Fife sets his mind to something, he does it," Jaeger said. "Whether it's tearing pages out of a phone book, swallowing metal washers, or selling a discarded Roxette CD to an imaginary friend for $600, every project he undertakes is a bona fide success. This truly is one focused loon.

School Shooting Solves All Of Troubled Youth's Problems
BOWLING GREEN, KY — For weeks, 11-year-old Brian Kolodiczek loudly boasted to classmates that he was going to get back at everyone who had caused him problems at school, everyone who had kept him from being popular and successful. Mission accomplished. At 1:15 p.m. Monday, Kolodiczek fired two dozen rounds into a helpless crowd assembled on the playground behind Stephen C. Calhoun Elementary School, killing nine students and four teachers, and solving all of the fifth-grader's problems in the process. "Brian was a troubled young boy. He felt like he didn't fit in with the other kids," school guidance counselor Camille Evans said. "But now that he's killed the classmates who upset him the most, things should be a lot better for him. Among the slain children was Larry Eichhorn, 11, pronounced dead at the scene. Kolodiczek was reportedly jealous of Eichhorn, who outshone him on the track team. "Larry was faster than Brian and anchored the relay team, and that always made Brian very angry," said track coach Buddy Miller, who shortly after the murder promoted Kolodiczek to relay anchor. "I guess Brian's the fastest now, though. Critically wounded in the attack was 10-year-old Holly Walsh. According to Walsh's best friend, Monica Reardon, Kolodiczek "really liked Holly, but she would never talk to him. She'd pretend he wasn't there or get me to tell him to leave her alone. " Early this morning, in her first statement since the shooting occurred, Walsh said she would "love to go out to a movie" with Kolodiczek as soon as she is released from the hospital. Calhoun Elementary principal Benjamin Brundage, who had met with Kolodiczek and his parents on numerous occasions over the years, said the boy was "frequently upset about certain teachers who he felt made unreasonable demands of him. In particular, he believed that his math teacher, Evelyn Baird, hated him and wanted him to fail. Baird was among the four teachers killed in the assault. "Maybe he'll get along with the new math teacher better," Brundage said. "If so, I think we can expect a big improvement in his grades. If not, he still has the gun. The other dead faculty members are drama teacher Marcia Crosley, who did not cast Brian in the school play; English teacher Donald Baum, who frequently criticized his penmanship; and social-studies teacher Stephen Reedy, who advised him to "lay off the Nintendo a bit. Music teacher Stella Hammond, who on May 11 made Brian stand in the back of the class with a tambourine, is in critical condition with a perforated lung. Experts say Kolodiczek's actions are part of an emerging trend in pre-adolescent behavior, a trend child psychiatrist Owen Green termed "shooting everybody you don't like. "Brian was bothered by all kinds of things at this school," Green said. "But did he just sit there and complain about it? No. He realized that complaining is not a solution. Instead, he took action. And the results speak for themselves. Despite the marked improvement in Kolodiczek's situation as a result of the shooting, some are saying that the bloody rampage was no solution at all. Said assistant principal Patrick Chernin: "Bobby Pratt, a classmate of Brian's who called him 'diaper baby' and made fun of his lunch box, was barely grazed on the leg in the shooting. He'll be back at school tomorrow. And another boy who regularly taunts Brian at his bus stop was absent altogether. Brian's problems have not entirely gone away, I assure you. Dr. Andrew Goldwyn, one of many grief counselors and specially trained therapists who will be on hand at Calhoun Elementary all next week, said that helping the students come to terms with the death of their friends will be a fairly easy task. "We will emphasize the positive side of this event — that their classmate Brian has eliminated many sources of pain and annoyance in his life," Goldwyn said. "That's a good thing. "Hopefully," Goldwyn continued, "a valuable lesson will come out of this shooting. Hopefully, these kids will learn that, like Brian, they too have the power to solve their own problems.

Obese Man Impaled In Wicker-Chair Disaster
STAUNTON, VA–Coroners are listing "massive wicker trauma" as the official cause in Monday's death of 420-pound Staunton resident Tony Grushecky. "Forensic evidence indicates that the base of the chair in which Mr. Grushecky sat gave out at 5 p.m. Monday, with the collapse driving razor-sharp wicker spears upwards of two feet into his morbidly obese body," Augusta County Coroner Edward Reynoso told reporters. "In my 22 years as coroner here, I've never seen such a brutal wicker-chair impaling. " Grushecky's enormous rolls of body fat were insufficient to protect him from the deadly spears, Reynoso said, and numerous vital organs were irreparably wickered.

Ex-Girlfriend To Arrive At 5:15 To Pick Up End Table
TUCSON, AZ–Jodi Hennings, 24, ex-girlfriend of area resident Rich Zeger, 25, announced Tuesday that she will arrive at 5:15 p.m. Thursday to pick up an end table from the apartment the two had shared until eight days ago. "I'm coming straight from work, so please be there," Hennings told Zeger during the 40-second telephone call she made from her new apartment, the location of which is unknown to Zeger. "Dave and I have tickets to a show, and I don't want to be late, so make sure to be around, okay? The 3' x 6' varnished-oak-veneer end table, which Hennings said should easily fit into the GMC Jimmy of her new boyfriend, Dave Klapisch, was purchased by the former couple at a yard sale in July 1996. Also acquired at the sale were a Rubbermaid juice pitcher and a tape dispenser, custody of which is currently in doubt. "We both paid half for the end table," said Zeger, sitting on the floor of the apartment he and Hennings shared for nearly three years. "But I'm pretty sure Jodi was the one who picked it out, so I guess it counts as hers. In order to be home at 5:15 p.m. for the end-table pick-up, Zeger, a clerk at Insty-Prints copy shop, will have to leave work early, resulting in a stern reprimand from his supervisor. "I'm totally gonna get reamed by [store manager] Peter [Goertz] for leaving early. The worst part is, Jodi acted like she didn't even know I'd be working then, even though I've had that same shift for the past year and a half," Zeger said. "But she said Dave and her were going out of town on a three-day weekend, so the only day they could pick up the table was Thursday." Other items claimed by Hennings in the breakup include the microwave, all the dishes and silverware with the exception of a mug reading, "Rich's Coffee," the futon, the answering machine, a "shower caddy," and a halogen lamp. Hennings also took the former couple's two cats, Percy, who originally belonged to her, and Michelangelo, who had belonged to Zeger. "Jodi read somewhere that it's bad to split up cats that have been living together for awhile, so she took both of them," Zeger said. "I'll really miss Michelangelo, though. I've had him since he was a kitten. Thursday's end-table pick-up will be Hennings' third trip to the apartment since the couple's Aug. 18 split. "The first time she came by, I thought she maybe wanted to talk about getting back together," Zeger said. "But it turned out she just wanted the bath mat. During both prior visits, Hennings was accompanied by Klapisch, which made Zeger uncomfortable. "Seeing Dave help her carry her stuff out was really weird, because I already sort of knew the guy. For the past few months, he and Jodi were taking this Tae Kwon Do class together, and I was always taking phone messages from him," Zeger said. "Then I met him face-to-face when he picked her up to go rock-climbing one weekend. "That was like a week before Jodi said it just wasn't working out between us anymore," Zeger said. "She said we'd both been ignoring the obvious problems in our relationship. Beyond the loss of household possessions, the breakup has inflicted a heavy financial toll on Zeger. Until he can find a roommate, he must pay the apartment's $600 monthly rent by himself, in addition to the entire security deposit, half of which has been returned to Hennings. "It really sucks, man, but what can you do? " said Zeger, who is supplementing his Insty-Prints income with bi-weekly visits to the local plasma-donation center. "I guess I should start looking for a roommate.

Conventional Love Affair Breaks None Of The Rules
SCHAUMBURG, IL — A thoroughly ordinary love affair between Chicago-area suburbanites Stephen and Denise Feeney has broken none of the rules, shocking no one with its non-torrid abandon and lack of forbidden passion, it was reported Tuesday. According to those familiar with the couple, the stable relationship between Stephen, 27, a Xerox copier-sales account manager, and Denise, 26, a buyer for Sears, continues to plod along steadily, provoking no vows of revenge from interloping outsiders sworn to keep the two apart at all costs. The partnership between the at-times somewhat-enthusiastic lovers is expected to continue on its current, mild path for years and is unlikely ever to end in star-crossed, tragic heartbreak. "My family has been very supportive of my marriage to Stephen," said Denise, speaking to reporters while doing a crossword puzzle in the mid-sized kitchen of the couple's mid-priced home. "They're always polite to him when we visit on holidays, so I guess they must like him well enough. They've never really said much about it, so, to the best of my knowledge, I'm not defying them in any way. Many times, a blossoming love affair flouts conventionally held beliefs, daring to boldly violate taboos in its furious, fevered pursuit of ecstatic union. Such is not the case, however, with the Feeneys' romance. From the moment they met while working summer jobs for the same Elgin, IL, catering company in 1991, they have followed the path of sober propriety, achieving partially consuming intimacy by exercising caution and reserve, keeping a clear head at all times, and taking care to avoid rash, possibly regrettable decisions. "When we got married, we decided to wait until I established myself as a regional assistant at Xerox before having our first child, Jessica, who is four now," Stephen said. "And once we could afford the down payment on a decent house in one of the better neighborhoods, we went ahead with our second child, little Bradley. It's important to start a family relatively early if you want to be able to give your kids the benefit of your prime years. Stephen noted that, in choosing a neighborhood, he and Denise looked closely at the quality of the local schools. He also stressed the importance of timely diphtheria vaccinations. The couple's level-headedness had been evident long before their wedding: A month after she and Stephen started dating, Denise sidestepped a potentially messy situation by quitting her community swing choir rather than pursuing a crush she had on a fellow member of the ensemble. "I'm so glad I did the right thing," she said. "Stephen has proven to be a reliable provider for our family unit. Sticking with him has proven extremely well-advised in the long run. Responding to a reporter's question, Denise said Stephen has never serenaded her from the street below her window, waking and angering the neighbors with a loud demonstration of the depth of his eternal love for her. "No, he's never done that," she said. "He did sing to me once, though, when I asked him to help me remember how the theme from PM Magazine went. When asked if he kept any strands of Denise's hair under lock and key in a family-heirloom locket that he held close to his heart on a golden chain at all times like a precious treasure, Stephen said, "I don't really keep anything like that lying around, no. But I do have the receipts from our first shared credit card. They're in the filing cabinet in the den. Does that count?

Couple Upstairs Going At It Again
BROOKLYN, NY–For the ninth time in as many hours, the couple upstairs went at it yet again at 4 a.m. Tuesday, hammering away at one another in an impressive display of sexual stamina and tenacity, apartment-directly-below sources said. "There they go again," said downstairs neighbor Murray Schuman, a 41-year-old bakery owner who gets up each day before dawn to decorate cakes, as a steady, rhythmic thumping knocked plaster dust from his ceiling for the umpteenth time. The couple, 26-year-old advertising copywriter Peter Kafka and his live-in companion, graphic-design specialist Rachel Brown, have reportedly been banging away ever since moving into the three-story brownstone last May. Both are said to be relatively quiet and conservative in outward appearance, qualities that belie their insatiable animal appetites and tremendous capacity for vigorous sexual exertion. Said a bleary-eyed Schuman: "They seem like a nice enough couple, and they always say hello when I run into them in the building's front lobby. But right now, I just need to get some rest. It seems like every night, just as I finally start to drift off to sleep, the gasping and pounding kicks in again. They start out gently, emitting little gasps of pleasure, and then gradually increase the intensity and tempo, eventually building up to full-strength shouts of 'Give me what I need!' and what have you. "Those two are a couple of real troopers, I'll give them that much," Schuman said. "They take care of business. Once they get started, they don't let up. Schuman said he normally wouldn't complain, but he had been tossing and turning for hours, and this business had been going on all night. As a high-pitched, seemingly endless chant of "Let me have it! " cascaded down from Kafka and Brown's third-floor apartment, he began banging on the ceiling with a broom, shouting that it was the middle of the goddamn night. Schuman is not the only building resident who has been affected by the constantly going-at-it couple. "Always with the schtupping at all hours," said apartment 2-B occupant Rose Teitelbaum, a retiree who has lived in this building since before you were born. "In my day, such a thing, it was shameful, a scandal. It is like a bordello, I am telling you. Such a racket! And unmarried, nu? Teitelbaum, whose bed is directly below Kafka and Brown's bathroom, site of their 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. sexual encounters, said the whole neighborhood is talking, and that she fears some days even to show her face for the embarrassment of having such flagrant and indiscreet young persons living in this, her building, where her own mother taught her so many years ago to show respect. According to neighborhood sources, the building has not witnessed such frequent, vigorous and vociferous sexual intercourse since May 1991, when the second floor walk-up was briefly occupied by a bicycle messenger named Ramon, who regularly kept residents awake with repeated late-night dalliances with someone he reportedly referred to as "Madre de Dios." Ramon left after just two months to pursue a modeling career in Los Angeles, sources said. Since then, however, many building residents have been fearful that the increasing gentrification of their neighborhood and subsequent influx of ambitious, young, sexually active college graduates may permanently alter the working-class, retiree neighborhood's placid atmosphere. "For this–the gasping, the thrusting, the pounding, the shouting in the middle of night–I pay taxes for 53 years? " Teitelbaum said. "Thank heaven my hearing is not so good as what it used to be, or I wouldn't get one wink of sleep with all the oohing and the aahing and the screaming like the gorillas in the jungle. Despite such strong opposition to the couple, widow and longtime building fixture Eleanor DiPaoli has been staunch in her support of Brown and Kafka. Claiming that young love is the most beautiful thing in all the world and that detractors like Teitelbaum are dried-up old bats who should only be so lucky, DiPaoli defended the couple's right to go at it whenever and as loudly as they wish. "In my day, the Earth itself would move from the titanic force of my late husband Salvatore and I making with the romance in the midnight hours," DiPaoli told reporters. "I would sing out in joy like an opera singer, with long sustained fortissimo arias. I was known as far away as Flatbush Avenue for the crescendos of passion I set forth on those breathless nights. Then my Sal, God rest his soul, would suddenly switch the tempo doppio movimento, and my heart would swell with joy. And those afternoon intermezzos, when he'd sneak back from the warehouse and call out 'Mi amor!' with his hands full of flowers and his smile full of love, oh, that I will never forget…" DiPaoli went on to speak at great length and in lurid detail before eventually falling asleep in her chair.

Area Oddball Prefers God Over Girls
EDINA, MN — In the pages of The Onion, you've met some of our nation's most unusual individuals over the years. And some have been pretty out there. Who can forget Edna McBain of Covington, KY, the wacky widow with the full-scale cement replica of the Apollo 11 moon landing in her barn? Then there's Jack Montague of Selma, AL, the World War II veteran who refuses to believe the war ever ended and continues to live in a basement bomb shelter, surviving on canned goods and communicating only by short-wave radio. Certainly, there have been some odd birds to grace The Onion's pages in the past. But get ready for the nuttiest one yet: Edina resident Jerome O'Shea is so religious, he says he's given up courting… for Christ! And not just for a day or a week, either, but for the rest of his natural life! You may be wondering what could make a man behave so bizarrely. According to O'Shea, he likes girls, likes them just fine. In fact, he's in an almost constant state of temptation for pert young female bodies, just like millions of other men. But O'Shea, convinced that the Lord wants him to remain "pure," says that he "received a calling" when he was a young man, which led him to attend the "Seminary" and become officially "ordained." And what does all this mean? It means O'Shea, 46, has taken a "holy vow of celibacy," sentencing himself to a life of abstinence in order to stay closer to God's path. Apparently, "The path of righteousness" and "The path of sexual frustration" mean pretty much the same thing in the wacky world of this fellow. So what does he do in his spare time that's so much better than a Saturday night on the town with a pretty gal on his arm? According to O'Shea, his "priestly duties" include "reading the liturgy, lighting ceremonial candles, and ministering to parishioners. " Whoa, slow down there, pal! You're out of control! Perhaps the oddest behavior of this kooky cleric is something he calls the "confessional," during which he sits in a darkened booth and listens to others talk about their sex lives. Weird-o-rama! Strangely enough, O'Shea's role as a "priest" carries with it the ceremonial title of "Father." Not likely! After all, it's a bit difficult to father a child without hooking up with a "mother," Father. Maybe somebody ought to sit this fellow down for a little lecture about the birds and the bees. Even more bizarre is O'Shea's weekly simulated cannibalism ritual, in which the body and blood of Christ are devoured by worshippers–but let's just leave that one alone. O'Shea has been put in the role of moral arbiter of his "congregation," a group of independent citizens who willingly pay him a living salary. Ironically, O'Shea plays an active role it the sex lives of his followers, giving them advice on how sex is best practiced. And what exactly is his advice? Ready for this one? No birth control allowed, you can't masturbate, and you can only have sex with one person your entire life. If this makes sense to any of you, readers, please explain. Well, one thing's for sure: We can profile strange members of our community for another thousand years, and we'll never top this one!

Mix Tape Expresses Subtleties Of Long-Term Relationship
AMHERST, MA — A mix tape made by Mandy Honig for boyfriend Jeff Kent in honor of the couple's one-year anniversary expresses the many subtleties of their long-term relationship, it was learned Monday. According to Honig, 19, a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts, each song on the mix has a special significance, capturing a different aspect of their deep, multi-dimensional love. "We're romantic together, but we can also be totally crazy and fun," Honig said. "And we're best friends. This mix reflects that amazing variety in our relationship. Among the songs on the mix that capture the couple's romantic side: Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You," Sting's "Fields Of Gold" and, most of all, Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On." "Jeff and I saw Titanic together, and I just cried through the entire thing–Jack and Rose reminded me so much of me and Jeff," Honig said. "When they played 'My Heart Will Go On,' at the end, I just completely lost it. Honig said that "My Heart Will Go On" has taken on added significance in the past two weeks, as she and Kent have been separated due to UMass' spring break. "Jeff went back to [his parents' house in] St. Louis, and I stayed here in Amherst," she said. "Every time I hear the line, 'Near, far, wherever you are,' I just bawl thinking about how much I miss him. Added Honig: "I love Jeff so much. While a majority of the songs on the mix capture a particular aspect of Honig and Kent's multi-faceted relationship, some are reminders of special moments the two have shared. "Last November, when Jeff's grandmother was in the hospital, he was really upset, and he called me, and we talked on the phone for like four hours," Honig said. "When we finally hung up at like 3 a.m., I turned on the radio and 'Wind Beneath My Wings' was playing. And I just thought to myself, that's exactly what we are to each other: We hold each other up. In addition to song selection, the mix's song order was given careful consideration. Honig said that the ballad-heavy nature of side one of the mix, which does not feature back-to-back uptempo songs until midway through side two, was intentional. "I did want to vary the tempo and get in some fun, fast ones, but it was very important to establish early on just how much I love Jeff," Honig said. "And I felt that the best way to do that was with slower songs like 'In Your Eyes' and 'Theme From Phantom Of The Opera.'" "Jeff and I have only been together a year, but I feel like I've known him all my life," Honig added. Despite the overall success of the mix, it did not come without its disappointments. Honig said she "really wanted" to include the song "Scenes From An Italian Restaurant," but at the last minute she discovered she'd left her Billy Joel's Greatest Hits CD at a friend's house. "I wanted to give it to Jeff the next day, which was our anniversary, so there was no time to run over to Kelli's and get it," she said. "I also wanted that song 'Friends And Lovers,' but I totally couldn't remember who sings it," Honig added. "I even sang it for the guy at Sam Goody when I was at the mall, but he said he didn't know. The most painful song omission of all, however, was "American Pie," which both Honig and Kent "totally love. " While Honig very much wanted to include the 1972 Don McLean classic, she ultimately made the difficult decision to leave it off due to its length. "I really wanted to include it, but I knew I could fit like three normal-length songs on instead of just that one," she said. "I was so bummed. While Kent could not be reached for comment at his parents' home in St. Louis, he is reportedly thrilled with the mix. In addition to denying his sister's request for a copy of it, explaining that it is "just for me and Mandy," he has already punched out the tabs at the top of the cassette to prevent anything from ever being recorded over it. "Jeff was so surprised when I gave it to him," Honig said. "He had no idea I was making it. He was really touched: He said it had more meaning than anything else I'd ever gotten him because I put so much of myself into it. Honig said she is already planning a follow-up mix for Kent's birthday on April 4. "I cannot wait to start working on that next mix," she said. "I've got so much more I want to say to Jeff, and there are so many more songs with which to say it.

Masturbator Held For Questioning In Series Of Brutal Masturbatings
SALEM, IN — Salem Middle School eighth grader Jeremy Royce, 15, was detained and questioned by police officials for more than three hours Monday in connection with a string of brutal masturbatings in the Salem area. "While no arrest has yet been made in the case," said Salem police chief Samuel Harper, "at this time, Mr. Royce very much appears to be our prime suspect. Ever since it began in March 1997, the string of horrific masturbatings has shaken this tiny farming community in southern Indiana. In the past month alone, some 31 kleenex, three socks, and one baseball cap have been found badly masturbated, some beyond recognition. According to Harper, Royce became the chief suspect following the discovery of a kleenex on the side of his bed identical to one found in a Salem Public Library men's-room stall and two others found in the second-floor boys' bathroom at Salem Middle School. Like the items previously found, the kleenexes appeared to have been severely masturbated. A subsequent search of Royce's sock drawer uncovered a number of items that may have been used in the crimes, including a 1982 "Sex In Cinema" issue of Playboy featuring Barbi Benton; a November 1991 issue of Gent; and a picture of ninth-grader Susie Sherwood from the 1997 Salem Middle School yearbook. "The person who perpetrated these crimes is a deeply disturbed individual, one with no regard for human decency whatsoever," Harper said. "Whoever committed these acts deserves to be put away for a long, long time. Royce has strenuously denied all charges, claiming to have been "at orchestra practice" at the time of the masturbatings.

Desire To Ejaculate Motivates Local Christian To Wed
PADUCAH, KY — Throughout his life, 22-year-old Matthew Leske has been a devout Christian, attending services three times a week at Holy Christ Almighty Lutheran Church in his hometown of Paducah, regularly participating in Bible-study devotionals with his mother and four sisters, and faithfully adhering to the dictums of his strict fundamentalist Christian upbringing. Throughout his post-pubescent life, Leske has also, like all male humans, been gripped by an intense, all-consuming desire to ejaculate sperm, but has been unable to do so out of fear of incurring the wrath of God and suffering an eternity of agonizing punishment in the afterlife. A part-time prep-cook and odd-job yardwork handyman when not volunteering as a Bible witness to local shut-ins and nursing-home residents, the young Leske has never had much time for socializing with members of the opposite sex. Nevertheless, last week, Leske announced his intention to marry fellow Christian Luann Ruth Perkins, also a member of Holy Christ Almighty, whom he met on a church-sponsored Luther League hayride two months ago. Leske cited his irresistible desire to achieve sexual climax and ejaculate sperm without having to go to hell as the number one factor in his decision to propose marriage. "I really want to discharge semen," he said. "I mean I really, really, really want to really bad. Living his 22 years inviolate under strict fundamentalist doctrine, Leske has never ejaculated, for to do so outside the holy bonds of sacramental matrimony would mean non-negotiable, eternal punishment upon death. "I don't want to go to hell," said Leske, explaining his decision not to engage in premarital ejaculation. "I am absolutely terrified of the burning and scorching of my impure, unclean flesh in the Lake of Fire; the prodding and stabbing by pitchforks wielded by demons; and, in particular, the unending, eternal torment in pits of boiling pitch as Satan the Deceiver laughs in sadistic glee. Burning with a desire to ejaculate so overwhelming that it has threatened to dwarf even his love for Christ, Leske has, ever since puberty, researched the subject at length, discovering "five score and seventeen" different methods by which males can achieve ejaculation. Unfortunately, Leske said, not one of them is permissible under fundamentalist-Christian law. "Homosexuality, masturbation, oral-genital contact, frottage, shoe fetishes, barnyard animals, leaning up against a washing machine on spin cycle — I could go on and on," Leske said. "I would have gladly tried any one of these, because, like I said, I really, really want to ejaculate. Regrettably, though, they are all punishable by eternal torment in the demon pits, so it was pretty much either get married or give up on ejaculating completely. While Leske is greatly looking forward to marriage and the sweet release of sperm it will bring, he noted that even in holy wedlock, fundamentalist Christian doctrine limits permissible ejaculation to just one circumstance: sexual congress for the purpose of procreation. "I'm going to want to start a family pretty much immediately," he said. "If I can get a raise and a second job, I figure I might be able to eventually support a family of as many as six or seven offspring. That means I should hopefully get to ejaculate seven times before I die. I know, you're thinking, 'That's not much.' But believe me, it will sure beat the heck out of what I'm doing now, which is not ejaculating at all. Leske does admit to harboring some doubts about his upcoming nuptials. "What if Luann, never having seen a naked man before, is so frightened that she refuses to allow me to ejaculate? " he said. "Divorce would be out of the question, and I'd be trapped forever in a non-ejaculatory marriage. It will probably work out okay, though: Once she becomes my wife, I should be able to command her to do whatever I say, and, even if it's against her wishes, it will be her Christian duty to obey me. No date has been set for the wedding, but Leske said he would like it to take place "as soon as humanly possible. "I have opened my heart and mind to Jesus Christ, the Son of God the Father, my Lord and Savior in Heaven, who died on the cross for my sins, that I might be born again in His blood. And I yearn for the righteous power of the Holy Spirit to fill me with holy inspiration. But I also yearn — desperately yearn, yearn with indescribable longing, I mean really, really yearn — to ejaculate. If it were up to me I would prefer to ejaculate right now. This minute. No lie.

Area Power Walker Looks Just Ridiculous

Housewife Charged In Sex-For-Security Scam
AKRON, OH — Area resident Helen Crandall, 44, was arrested by Akron police Sunday, charged with conducting an elaborate "sex-for-security" scam in which she allegedly defrauded husband Russell Crandall out of nearly $230,000 in cash, food, clothing and housing over the past 19 years using periodic offers of sexual intercourse. "It's the biggest scam of its kind I've ever seen," Akron police chief Thomas Agee said. "We're talking coats, dishwashers, jewelry, sewing machines, bathroom cleansers — you name it. According to Agee, undercover agents spotted Crandall's husband handing her $50 in cash at approximately 4 p.m., just 30 minutes after the two had sex. Crandall then drove off in her car, returning home two hours later with five bags of groceries. "That's when we made the arrest," Agee said. "After tracking her for years, we finally had proof that she was buying all those goods with dirty money. During the arrest, Akron police officials entered the Crandall household and seized more than 150 items Mrs. Crandall had received from her husband over the last 19 years, including a four-speed adjustable food processor, 12 pairs of earrings, a matching sofa and loveseat, a box of two-ply kitchen garbage bags, and a portable radio. In exchange for these items, Agee said, Crandall's husband received sex an estimated 950 times — most frequently in the master bedroom, but also in the downstairs den three times, and once on the floor of the sewing room. In addition to physical evidence, Akron police have collected considerable eyewitness testimony. More than 250 Akron residents have come forward to report seeing Helen and Russell Crandall together, and several said they witnessed Mr. Crandall flagrantly purchasing items for his wife. "Sure, they'd come in here," said Ray Greene of Greene's House and Home. "I think the last time they got one of those box fans with the three settings. Perhaps the most damaging testimony has come from Mr. Crandall himself, who on Tuesday told police that while the couple was dating in 1977, Mrs. Crandall — then known as Helen Steuben — demanded that he buy her a ring worth over $1,000 before he could have sex with her. The first sexual liaison took place some six months later at Bob's Honeymooner Hotel during an all-expenses-paid trip to Niagara Falls. It was also in 1977, Mr. Crandall said, that his wife quit her job at Shippee Shoes in downtown Akron. "Clearly," Summit County prosecutor Andrew Dravecky said, "after quitting her job, the accused began receiving money under the table from some other source: How else could she have afforded to not work? It's now pretty apparent that at that point she began supporting herself by providing a certain service to Mr. Crandall." Crandall's mother, Bernice Steuben, a resident of the Valley View Senior Home in Yuma, AZ, is being sought for questioning in connection to the case: Police suspect that Steuben may have introduced her daughter to the sex-for-security scam after having used it herself from 1932 to 1971. But for all the evidence collected against Crandall, Dravecky said the case will likely be difficult to prosecute. "Helen was very careful to cover her tracks," he said. "She even got her husband to put her name on the bank accounts and credit cards. The Crandall case is not an isolated incident, said criminologist John Ohlmeyer, who said there are "literally millions" of such cases across the U.S. each year that never come to court. "This kind of thing isn't as uncommon as we'd all like to think," Ohlmeyer said. "A woman finds herself in a situation where she isn't employable. Or maybe she has interests like child-rearing, cooking and home-maintenance that keep her from getting a job. So what does she do? She cooks up a scheme to entrap a man using her body as the bait. It's frightening, but it happens every day in this country.

Area Man's Ex-Girlfriend Glad She Bumped Into Him
ST. PAUL, MN — In a chance meeting at a St. Paul grocery store Monday, area resident Erica DeGrath, 23, announced to ex-boyfriend Kevin Hollander, 24, that she was glad to have bumped into him. According to witnesses, DeGrath — who on Jan. 1 abruptly announced she was breaking up with Hollander after nearly three years of dating and two years of cohabitation — spoke with Hollander for several minutes in the canned-vegetables aisle of the Pic-N-Sav supermarket. In closing the conversation, witnesses said, her exact words were, "I'm glad I bumped into you, Kevin. It was really good to see you again. Hollander responded by telling DeGrath he was glad to have bumped into her, as well. Several hours later, however, Hollander openly questioned the sincerity of his ex-girlfriend's closing remark. "Was she really glad that she bumped into me? " Hollander said. "It's better than the 'I don't love you anymore, and I'm never coming back' I got a month ago, but I don't know if she meant it. But what if she did? Maybe she wants to get back together. Alex Murphy, a co-worker of DeGrath's at a downtown St. Paul Barnes & Noble, said that, in all likelihood, DeGrath was not actually glad to bump into her ex-boyfriend. "A few weeks ago, Kevin came by the bookstore and asked for Erica," Murphy said. "When I told her that Kevin was in the store looking for her, she hid in the back and told me to tell him she was out to lunch. Other sources close to DeGrath agree that she was not actually glad to bump into Hollander, pointing out that ever since the breakup, she has adopted a strict policy of Hollander-avoidance. "Erica told me that if Kevin calls, I'm supposed to tell him that she's not home," said Andrea Epps, DeGrath's new roommate and longtime friend. "And if she's home alone, she always lets the answering machine get it. I kind of get the feeling she doesn't want to talk to him. Cheryl Reiner, DeGrath's best friend, agreed. "She just totally doesn't want to deal," she said. Whether or not DeGrath was actually glad to bump into Hollander, the remark was clearly effective in terminating the unexpected encounter. "After Erica said she was glad to bump into me, that was about it for our conversation. It was sort of like, 'See ya,'" Hollander said. "I was thinking about asking her if I could walk her to her new place and see how our cat Felix was doing, but after I got the 'Glad I bumped into you' line, I figured that would have just sounded stupid. Hollander went on to relate how strange it was not to be awaken by a hungry Felix scratching at his bedroom door the morning after DeGrath moved out. DeGrath, who did not give Hollander any specific reasons for moving out, is described by friends as cheerful and well-adjusted since the break-up. "She's doing great," Reiner said. "She's dating a lot, her job is going really well, and she's lost like five pounds since she dumped Kevin. I'm really happy for her. Close acquaintances of Hollander were unable to comment on his current state, as they have not spoken with him in weeks. "That guy has been a total recluse," said Steve Woczynski, who has been friends with Hollander since high school. "He never returns anyone's phone calls anymore. A few weeks ago, I was driving, and I saw him crossing a street, just wandering around. He looked like shit. "I really thought we were going to get married," said Hollander, who last showered Jan. 10. "But I guess it was nice to see her at Pic-N-Sav, if only for a few minutes. After sitting silently for several moments, Hollander excused himself and walked to his bedroom, closing the door behind him.

Picture At Party Comes Out Great

The glossy, 3x5 picture, taken by Jeff using Kerri's camera, is widely regarded as the best on the entire 24-shot roll. At least four people have already requested doubles. Walgreens employee Aimee Hartley, who developed the picture in the store's state-of-the-art Kodacolor Lab, was immediately impressed with the shot. "When I first saw the picture, I was blown away," Hartley said. "We get a lot of party pictures here, but this one is truly something special. According to experts, what makes this picture so special is that its three subjects are total best friends. "Stacy, Kerri and Jill are what is commonly known as 'complete best buds,'" University of Illinois history professor J. Walter Tillinghast said. "They do everything together: They rushed Alpha Chi Omega together, they eat meals and attend football games together — everything. Recently, the three even bought identical school sweatshirts. National Archives photo historian Timothy Gruen offered a different explanation for the greatness of the picture. "Jill was in New York all summer, so neither Stacy nor Kerri had seen her since May," Gruen said. "No doubt this contributed to the tremendous look of excitement on their faces. The roll of film was picked up by Kerri late Tuesday afternoon after a long, frustrating delay. "They said the pictures would be ready yesterday at around 3. So I go in [to Walgreens] at like 4 o'clock and they still weren't ready," Kerri explained. "They said to try back in like an hour, but I had class, so I had to come back today. I was so pissed! Kerri noted that when she finally did pick up the pictures, she "was like, finally! Despite the picture's widely recognized greatness, not everyone is pleased with it. "Ew, I look gross," said Jill upon seeing it for the first time. "I'm all sweaty, and my eyes are half-closed. You guys (Stacy and Kerri) look amazing, though. Stacy strongly disagreed with Jill's assessment of the picture. "Jill looks amazing," she said. "I look gross. While Kerri has promised to make copies of the photo for a number of her friends, many observers are skeptical. "When a picture comes out great, doubles are very often promised," said Hal Wallace, director of Tufts University's Institute For Media Studies. "Very rarely, however, are those copies ever actually delivered. Nevertheless, Kerri has made it clear that she is committed to following through on her promise to make copies. On Wednesday, Stephanie, a friend of the three, said to Kerri, "You have to make me a copy," to which Kerri responded, "Definitely!" As for the future of the photo, Tillinghast predicted it will go in a photo album with other standouts from the past. "Kerri has an album of college memories into which this would fit perfectly," he said. "The album contains many great pictures of the three going all the way back to freshman orientation, including one from that time last fall when Jill and Stacy arrived intoxicated at Kerri's dormitory room at three in the morning with pizza sauce smeared on their cheeks. That was hilarious. While the photo is clearly the standout of the roll, there are a number of other great shots. Among them is one of Chad Webber, who friends said "totally never drinks," doing a beer bong. "That was so hysterical," Jill said. "He did, like, the whole thing! Other noteworthy shots include one of Steve and Jessica, moments before "hooking up," and one of Ryan vomiting all over Matt and Steve's carpet. For all the accolades the picture has brought Stacy, Kerri and Jill, the three are not resting on their laurels: Should the opportunity arise, they said they would not hesitate to pose together again. "Josh and Aaron are having a huge party Saturday night after the game," Stacy said. "I am definitely bringing my camera.

Fanzine Marred By Grammatical Error
BERKELEY, CA — A rare grammatical error was discovered Monday in the latest issue of MangaMash, a fanzine devoted to hardcore Japanese speed-metal bands and Sanrio/Hello Kitty novelty kitsch products. The error, which involved the incorrect usage of "your" instead of "you're," shocked and disappointed MangaMash's estimated dozen readers, who for over 11 months and three issues have come to admire the fanzine's commitment to journalistic excellence. "I guess I just missed that one," said editor/publisher Dave Pelks, 20, who said he usually tries to read the fanzine once before taking it to the copy shop. "It's 'you're' and not 'your'? Shit, I always mess that up. The error marks the first for MangaMash since last year's April/November issue, in which "New York" was spelled "New Yrrok." Pelks defended his previous error. "That wasn't like a real mistake," he said. "That time I just totally typed it wrong by accident. I know how to spell New York." Pelks stressed that it was late at the time, and that he was "really tired. The latest error has prompted Pelks to make a significant overhaul of the fanzine's editorial process. "I think from now on, I'm gonna have my sister Anne look it over before I make any copies," he said. "She's only 15, but she's really good at spelling and writing. She's, like, the brain of the family. As an added safety check, Pelks said that if Anne is unavailable for editing, he will ask his mother for help. Because of the typo, future expansion plans have been put on hold. "I was hoping do a color cover for the next issue," Pelks said. "Actually, not in color, but on color paper. It was going to be a big picture of Hello Kitty fighting Gamera on green paper. That would've been so cool. According to industry insiders, the mistake puts the fanzine's rock-solid editorial reputation in jeopardy. "This is a serious error," Random House vice-president Margaret Ferber said. "It's MangaMash's most significant mistake since two issues ago, when Pelks stapled all the cover pages on upside-down." "I totally wasn't paying attention," Pelks said of that incident. Collectors estimate the value of the rare upside-down-cover issue at zero dollars. Despite the most recent slip-up, MangaMash's two distributors have vowed to stand behind the embattled fanzine. "MangaMash provides the best coverage around of Japancore bands like HappyGinzaPoo and Shoko Ono," said Pat Kwiatkowski, owner of Crush Records, a Berkeley-area record store specializing in used LPs and hard-to-find imports. "Their recent feature on KyotoFunFun's tour of New Zealand was outstanding. Paul Scobee, manager of a downtown Berkeley Stop-N-Pop convenience store, also stood by the fanzine. "A few months ago, [Pelks] asked me if he could leave a few copies of his magazine by the door," Scobee said. "So I told him yeah, as long as they don't block the entrance. So far, it's been okay. The fanzine's most recent mistake does not surprise linguists, who say that it ranks among the most commonly made grammatical errors. "A lot of people confuse 'your' and 'you're,'" New York Times columnist William Safire said.

Local Puppet Ignores Repeated Audience Dragon Warnings:
SEYMOUR, IN — Despite loud and repeated audience warnings, an area puppet was attacked by a dragon during a performance of The Silver Bananas in the children's section of the Seymour Public Library Sunday. The puppet, Prince Bumbo The Monkey, is in serious but stable condition with extensive cloth injuries. According to police, audience members warned Prince Bumbo "at least a half dozen times" that Brimstone, a Seymour-area dragon whose magic silver bananas Bumbo had just stolen, was behind him. Each time, however, Bumbo refused to heed the warnings, boasting that Brimstone would never dare to attack him. As Brimstone neared Prince Bumbo, the monkey stopped in mid-sentence and looked around as though he heard something, but quickly returned to boasting about the banana theft, which only agitated the audience further. As the dragon opened his jaws, Prince Bumbo finally appeared to hear the warnings. "What? You say there's a big mean dragon behind me? Oh, come on, I don't believe you," he said. "We insisted it was true," said audience member and mother of three Sherri Pryce, "so Prince Bumbo finally turned around to look, but Brimstone then shifted to the other side so that the puppet could not see him. We then told Prince Bumbo to look in the other direction, but when he did Brimstone only returned to his original position behind Prince Bumbo." The monkey then accused the audience of "just being jealous," and returned to inspecting his stolen silver bananas. It was then that the dragon struck, severely shaking Prince Bumbo in his felt-lined jaws and forcing the monkey to return the treasure. Seymour police chief Ron Byrne said the attack could easily have been avoided. "When I come to schools to talk to kids about the importance of dragon safety, one of the first things I tell them is, always be sure to turn around completely if you think a dragon is stalking you," said Byrne, who happened to attend Sunday's show with his three-year-old son. "This monkey did not do so, and now he's paying for it. According to leading puppet psychologist Dr. Gary Wisniewski, violence has grown increasingly common in the puppet world. "Puppets have very limited free will," said Wisniewski, whose clients include such celebrity puppets as Howdy Doody and X the Owl. "They are controlled by strings or by a human hand, and are continually forced to mouth the words of others. In addition, their environment is limited to the small, cramped puppet-theater stage. As a result, many puppets develop deep feelings of helplessness, anger and frustration, feelings that can very easily lead to violence. Seymour Public Library officials offer a more direct explanation for the latest case of puppet-on-puppet violence. "It's unfortunate that Prince Bumbo didn't pay attention to the audience and was attacked by the dragon," assistant library director Patti Colby said. "But if he hadn't been such a greedy, stubborn little monkey who didn't want to share, it would never have happened. Nevertheless, library officials have ordered beefed-up security for next week's performance of Mr. Bear, Queen Bee And The Stolen Honey. "That show could be serious trouble," said John Reinholt, head of security for the library. "A lot of the puppets want to get their hands on that honey. Reinholt said the library is still investigating a June 25 stick-beating incident involving local puppets Punch and Judy, and no arrests have been made in connection with the gruesome boiling of a wolf last May.

Pierced Tongue Fails To Make Local Woman Less Boring
COLLEGE STATION, TX — Sources within the tongue-piercing community revealed Monday that area resident Jen Macalester, 20, is no less boring now than she was prior to last week's tongue-piercing at the Piercing Pagoda in College Station's CrossGates Mall. While Macalester had hoped the tongue ring would give her "an edgy, dangerous, anti-establishment air," in actuality it did little to disguise her unremarkable personality and utterly predictable tastes. In the wake of the piercing failure, Macalester has reportedly been significantly cheered up by Tuesday's release of the new 311 album.

Coffeehouse Encounter Results In Conversation, Cunnilingus
AUSTIN, TX — Area college students Chris Montez and Amy Hammond achieved orally stimulated orgasm Monday evening after a chance encounter at the Java Europa coffeehouse. Experts agreed that Java Europa, with its unique atmosphere of comfortable, easy-going lounging and vaguely left-leaning political and cultural sensibilities, was instrumental in the success of the coupling. "It is a well-known fact that when acting in combination, handmade Andean wall hangings, the music of Billie Holiday and overpriced foreign beverages are excellent facilitators of the type of mutually satisfactory, gender-sensitive, non-threatening consensual oral sex experienced by these lucky youngsters Monday," University of Texas sociology professor Richard Ammons said. "That is to say, as opposed to the more traditional fumbling, awkward, guy-on-top, 90-second type of sex generally brought on by a sports-bar environment. Montez, a junior in comparative literature, and Hammond, a sophomore in political science, were both "greatly pleased" by the evening's events. "I especially enjoyed the double mocha latte," said Montez, 20. "It added a milieu, if you will, of continental sophistication to my late-night studying and was no doubt a key factor in my attracting Amy's attention. "The conversation was also wonderful," Montez added. "But I must admit that while I enjoyed discussing Ginsburg and Burroughs with Amy, I was picturing her naked the entire time. Hammond, 19, also had no complaints. "By showing me that he was interested in my opinion on the literary merits of various Beat writers," she said, "Chris established the level of confidence and trust necessary for me to enthusiastically grind my velveteen vulva against his handsome, slightly stubbled face. Though as of press time the two have no plans to ever see each other again, both agreed that the oral sex — as well as the worldly and sophisticated conversation and beverages that preceded it — was enriching and rewarding. "It sure beats talking to some drunken frat guy who's just trying to figure out which girl is most likely to let him in her pants," Hammond said. "I ought to know: My old boyfriend Brad was like that. All he ever wanted was me to do was pleasure him. He was never sensitive to my orgasmic needs, the way Chris was last night. Java Europa owner Pat Gunther said that Monday's sexual encounter was not the first his coffeehouse had facilitated. "Every day, people meet here and go on to enjoy casual, meaningless sexual romps," she said. "Whether it's cunnilingus, fellatio, rimming or fisting, there's something about this place that's conducive to random consensual sex. Gunther noted that just last Friday, two strangers sat down together and discussed French theorist Michel Foucault before heading off to enjoy heated intercourse. Jim Wiersma, who owns the Tru-Value hardware store next door to Java Europa, said that his shop has seen little of the sort of encounters familiar to the coffeehouse. "We don't get too many college students looking for serendipitous sexual dalliances here," Wiersma said. "Mostly we get middle-aged married men looking for extension cords and ratchets and paint primers, that sort of thing.

Woman Injured In Hostile Makeover
NEW YORK — Area resident Julie Milner is in stable condition following a hostile makeover Monday. According to witnesses, Milner was looking at mascara at the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics counter at Macy's when several salespeople violently descended upon her, applying thick coats of rouge and eye shadow until she fell unconscious. "It was horrible," witness Stacie Hull said. "They had her in autumn colors, and she was obviously a winter.

Mental Hospital Fire Leaves Hundreds Of Demons Homeless
QUEENS, NY — Hundreds of demons were left hovering bodiless over New York's Creedmore Mental Hospital Sunday, as a fire consumed the facility, killing all 355 of its patients and much of its staff. Firefighters and emergency medical technicians struggled to reunite the demons with the bodies they had possessed, but no survivors could be found. Though area shelters say they may not have room for all the demons, most of the displaced remain optimistic. "I'm not too worried," said one demon as it huddled near a firetruck, wrapped in a blanket and sipping a cup of hot cocoa provided by Red Cross volunteers. "I'm sure pretty soon I'll find a suitable host human who will succumb to my temptations and give his body up to me.

Out-Of-State License Plate Seen
SEYMOUR, IN — In a rare instance of roadway variety, a license plate from a far-away state was spotted on Maple Lane Tuesday. The exact state from which the vehicle originated was not known, as it was too far away for witnesses to make out the license's fine print. "I think it might have been from New York, because I think I saw that picture of the Statue of Liberty in the middle," said Milton Herkimer, who lives at 45 Maple Lane. "But maybe it was a pelican. " Neighbor MarySue Petersen said she "thought it said 'California' across the top," but acknowledged that "I didn't have my reading glasses on at the time. " Despite widely varying descriptions of the license plate, all agreed that it was "not from Indiana."

Local Senior Impressed With Restaurant Cheesecake
HOBOKEN, NJ — According to reports, area senior Herbert Bloch, 69, was "impressed" with the slice of strawberry cheesecake served to him at the Denny's restaurant on Sand Hill Road Monday. "The cheesecake was very flavorful and moist," Bloch was reported to have told the server. He also was rumored to have praised the flaky crust and said that the cake had "just the right amount of whipped cream. " Sources close to Bloch's server indicated that prior to his ordering of the cheesecake, Bloch consumed a Philadelphia cheese-steak sandwich. It was believed that he found it to be delicious, as well. Sources inside Denny's believe that Bloch, who dined alone, commented on the cheesecake in a sad attempt to engage another human being in conversation. Bloch is expected to return to Denny's in the future to order more cheesecake.

Jewish Texans Commemorate Holocaust... Texas-Style!
LUBBOCK, TX — The West Texas chapter of B'nai B'rith is holding a month-long series of events in remembrance of the Holocaust, commemorating the 20th century's darkest hour the way they do everything… Texas-style! "If we do not remember the past, we are doomed to repeat it," said San Antonio Rabbi Leonard "Too Tall" Sussman at Sunday's opening ceremony, laying a wreath before the Lone Star Of David in front of B'nai B'rith headquarters in Lubbock. "The world was silent, and in silence lies complicity. Never again, y'hear?" Added Sussman, "Yee-haw!" He then lit the ceremonial Eternal Flame, over which a spit will be installed for Wednesday's kosher steer cookout. Among the highlights of Holocaust Hoedown '97: a Main Street parade featuring red, white and blue Texas blossoms spelling out "Don't Mess With The Jews"; a special appearance by six-time Zionist calf-roping champion Barry Lowenstein; and daily double-bill showings of Schindler's List and John Wayne's True Grit. "Have we learned the lessons of the Holocaust?" asked Deborah Teitelbaum, director of Dallas' Museum of the Holocaust. "If the answer is yes, then how does one explain events in such places as Cambodia and Bosnia? What do we tell the orphaned child in Rwanda? And how 'bout them Cowboys!"

Area Stores Stock Up On Shit
CHICAGO — With the official start of the holiday season just days away, Chicago retailers — like those across the U.S. — are bracing for the coming onslaught of shoppers with an unprecedented stockup on shit. "You wouldn't believe how much shit we are selling," said Amos Frawley, manager of a Chicago-area Wal-Mart store. "Electric razors, Toy Story videos, novelty ties, football phones, Hickory Farms cheese-and-meat gift sets — you name it, they're buying it. We're packing every inch of shelf space with shit, and we still can't keep up with the demand. Among the shit expected to reach new sales levels this year is Christmas-themed shit, such as shiny tree decorations and ceramic, hand-painted Santa figurines. Also expected to sell well are articles of clothing which light up at night, such as glow-in-the-dark Joe Boxer-brand boxer shorts and battery-operated Dearfoam slippers with special "Nite-Lites" attached to the front. "Novelty shit always seems to sell well," said Elaine Maier, head apparel buyer for an area Marshall Field's department store. "Then again, around this time of year, people will buy just about any shit they can get their hands on. Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, IL, is getting into the spirit of the holidays — and of selling loads of shit — by decorating its courtyard in a "Wonderland of Shit" motif featuring Christmas-themed shit from all 172 of its stores. Actor Jeff Goldblum is slated to appear at the mall Friday to officially kick off the festivities by reciting his famous Jurassic Park line, "That is one big pile of shit. Though Christmas is still weeks away, the shopping has already hit a fever pitch. "I got to the mall at 6 a.m. today, two hours before it even opened," said Edgar Janks of DeKalb, IL. "I want first crack at the shit. Nobody wants to get there after all the good shit's gone. Said Chicago's Debra Tanner, who was at the mall Monday to buy a large amount of shit, including a cordless phone, a Charlotte Hornets NBA Starter jacket and a five-speed foot massager: "I don't have nearly enough time to get the shit I need. Lower prices are also expected to spur purchases of shit this year. Toys 'R' Us, the nation's largest toy retailer, is aggressively promoting its seasonal slogan, "The shit you want at the best prices. "Not only is there more shit this year than ever before," said noted economist Milton Friedenzohn, "but what there is is far shittier. The Sanyo boom boxes being sold this year, for example, are even more likely to break than those from the previous year. And those new Panasonic WebTVs are just shit. In addition to familiar retailers, shops specializing in seasonal shit are opening temporarily in hopes of capitalizing on the December craving for shit. "Christmas Shit," "Wicks 'n' Shit," and "Bob's Shittery" are just a few of the stores offering customers nothing but shit. Even supermarkets are altering their inventories to meet the demand for shit, filling shelves with decorative snack tins featuring depictions of Santa Claus, which cost twice as much as comparable items that come in ordinary packaging. Also available are pfefferneuse cookies, egg nog and holiday Oreo cookies with red shit inside. Said Friedenzohn: "There's going be a whole lot of shit under America's Christmas trees this year.

Heroic Plastic Surgeon Gives Small-Breasted Starlet Chance At Normal Life
BEVERLY HILLS, CA — In this world of war, crime and death, it often seems there are no more heroes. But here in the City of Angels, a real, live angel emerged Monday, when plastic surgeon Gilbert "Gil" Kosinski — in a desperate, white-knuckle 30-minute procedure — heroically restored firmness, girth and jigglability to the tragically undersized breasts of 23-year-old would-be starlet Debi Sands. "I was only doing my duty as a physician," the hero surgeon modestly told reporters, speaking via cellular phone en route to a racquetball engagement shortly after the grueling surgery's completion. "I have taken a sacred vow, the Hippocratic Oath, to do whatever it takes to enhance a person's natural features, regardless of cost. It is a vow I will never forsake. Even though she is only 23, the now-perky Sands (formerly Maureen Mulderheim) is no stranger to hardship. Tragically afflicted with small breasts at an early age, she refused to let her handicap get the best of her, instead focusing on developing skills such as make-up application and wardrobe coordination, all the while dreaming of becoming a movie star. An idealistic young starlet when she left her hometown of Big Bear, MO, for Hollywood seven months ago, she grew up fast when faced with the harsh realities of small-breasted life in the big city. "I couldn't meet the right agents, get invited to the right parties, or give the right handjobs to the right cokehead producers in the right Ferraris," Sands said. Though she earned a modest living as a TV bikini extra, true success, in the form of a speaking part or nudity-requiring role, eluded her. "I was seriously considering going back to cocktail hostessing, where some nights I barely cleared 30 bucks an hour," she said, recalling those lean early months. But just as things were hitting rock-bottom, a friend told Sands about a new miracle drug called "silicone" that could restore her breasts. That's when Dr. Kosinski entered the picture. Just two days after a no-cost initial consultation, the life-saving surgery was performed at Kosinski's Rodeo Drive office, leaving the afflicted starlet's chest forever changed. "Debi's plight moved me," the hero doctor said. "People were entranced by her dazzling smile, her beautiful blue eyes and her eagerness to sleep with men in positions of power. Yet, sadly, no producers wanted to see her with her top off in their movies. " Kosinski paused, visibly overcome with emotion, or possibly the three martinis he had consumed during lunch at Spago's, before continuing. "I took one look at her and thought, 'I've got to help this gorgeous little piece of ass lead a normal life.' Though the surgery required great sacrifice on Kosinski's part, the miracle healer endured the inconveniences with bravery and aplomb. "Sure, I had a great tee time with a very rich client that I had to cancel. But I knew in my heart that this was more important. Now in possession of a more-than-healthy 38-D chest, Sands has already made it past the first casting cut for Paramount Pictures' upcoming Body Wishes, a romance-thriller which climaxes in a strip-club shootout. "There's a dozen strippers who get blown away in that scene," Sands said, her voice brimming with newfound confidence. "I know I'm going to be one of them. But as much as the surgery has meant to Sands and her career, it meant perhaps even more to Kosinski. "This procedure has special significance for me," Kosinski said. "It's the same exact one I performed on my own lovely wife of 19 months, Trish, who is almost the same age as Debi." When asked if he had ever used his healing powers to aid those disfigured by burns, accidents or acts of violence, Kosinski said, "Why, no. " Yet he says his heart goes out to all the cosmetically imperfect people of the world — regardless of race, creed, color or income.

Important Man Angered By Inadequate Seating
NEW YORK — In what is being dubbed "a serious breach of importance-based table-placement protocol," a very important man was given inadequate lunchtime seating at Effendi's in downtown Manhattan Monday. The important man, James L. Norridge, a senior partner in the prestigious New York law firm of Habisch, Guidry, Norridge, Goldfarb, Dwyer & Bleen, has filed a federal complaint against the upscale restaurant. The grievance will be heard by the House Reservations and Seating Investigatory Subcommittee later this week. According to sources close to the maître d', the restaurant failed to provide Norridge with seating commensurate with his social standing and importance, placing him "shockingly close to the kitchen" in a poorly lit spot. If found guilty by the congressional subcommittee, the restaurant could be fined up to $250,000 and have all of its dishwashers and busboys deported. "This case is very important to us," subcommittee member Rep. Peter King (R-NY). "Mr. Norridge is an important man. "In 20 years I have never been treated with such callous disregard," Norridge said. "Apparently, you people don't realize how important I am. I just signed a $27 million account with the Toshiba people this very afternoon. And now this? Do you know who I am? Of primary importance in the case, sources say, is the low social standing, or "unimportance," of everyone involved other than Norridge himself. "I've got more important things to do than worry about a restaurant getting a simple seating arrangement right," Norridge said. "That's why I pay other people to do it, and I expect them to get it straight. What do I look like? A blue-collar laborer? I happen to be an important man in this town! As an important man, Norridge has become accustomed to being treated with deference and respect by everyone he meets, almost all of whom are less important than he is. Norridge regularly receives priority valet parking, enjoys the compliments of the chef, and has not had to pay for a piece of ass on the convention circuit since 1971. "I was getting VIP ski passes in Vail when you were still in short pants! " he shouted to reporters. Norridge further asserted that he has a position to maintain in this community and that he knew your father. "The nerve, expecting me to eat a meal while there are Mexicans clattering dirty dishes in the next room a mere 10 yards away. I was planning on lunching with an important client today, but obviously that just can't happen now. The meeting is just too important," he said. "Good Christ! Do you even understand what I do all day, and how important it is that it gets done? Just talking to you now, I've probably missed two, maybe three important faxes. "If you were important like me," he continued, "you'd understand what I'm saying, but I can see by the slack-jawed expressions on your ape-like, unimportant heads that you do not. He then paused, using his cellular phone to call his answering service and yell at them for missing several important calls. "We are very, deeply, horribly remorseful over what happened that black day," Effendi's owner Hercule Laurent said of the incident, wringing his hands and rending his garments, prostrating himself in the dust and otherwise debasing himself in shame. "I am not important.

Total Hunk Sitting Over By Plant
SCHAUMBURG, IL — According to several female shoppers at Woodfield Mall, a total hunk was sitting by a plant near the Wok 'n' Roll booth Friday. "He's so cute," said Melanie Ford, 22. The hunk was reportedly wearing a gray cardigan sweater and had "strong-looking hands. " "I'm, like, imagining what it would be like to ride in his car," Ford's friend, Jessica Loew, said. A One Potato Two official could not verify the report, as the manager had left strict instructions that the register was not to be left unattended.

Snobs, Slobs Face Off at Area Country Club
The elite Bushcrest Country Club was turned upside-down yesterday, as a throng of unkempt, drunken slobs descended upon the normally reserved social institution, terrorizing its uptight member snobs and stirring up all sorts of general mayhem. Refusing to adhere to club dress codes, membership restrictions and mandates of behavioral decorum, the slobs, many of them fun-loving, irrepressible free spirits from the club's golf course service staff, stood up to the boring, repressed snobs by overturning tea services, diving into the club pool and using sexually suggestive language in the presence of Bushcrest's stern, elderly matriarchs. Though the country club's blustering snobs were shocked and dismayed at the lowbrow state of affairs, witnesses report that their ineffective red-faced fuming only heightened the riotousness of the disruptions, as their expressions of outrage functioned as a sharp foil to the slobs' shameless misbehavior. "Why, in my day, such impropriety would have never been allowed here at Bushcrest," said Judge Ted Bishop, considered by many to be the worst of the snobs. "Young man! Get down from there immediately and buff these shoes with a fine chamois! When his demands were not met by the unruly servants, Bishop threw his yachting hat on the ground, clenched his teeth and said, "Oooooo!" Though details are still sketchy, according to reports, the slobs are a bunch of crazy kids who just want to have a good time and are sick of always getting hassled by club members and guests. And, surprisingly, despite the slobs' wild behavior, some of the club's wealthier patrons have chosen to ally themselves with the slobs. Of the club's slob sympathizers, the most notable may be google-eyed billionaire Rodger Dandenrude, who yesterday cranked up the volume near the seventh hole with a cry of, "C'mon, you stiffs — let's dance! " and proceeded to "boogie down" to the smash hit "Any Way You Want It" by popular rock band Journey. He was reportedly wearing a loud, tacky shirt at the time. "Why, that young man over there said the word 'balls'!" club member Eunice Stuffingsdale, 82, said, pointing toward a shirtless youth who had used the word in reference to golf but had also deliberately made an irreverent double-entendre. "All I could do was stand there huffing and puffing, unable to speak for the sheer shock of such adolescent, indecorous language. Stuffingsdale's thrusting, accusatory pointing underscored her own uptight authoritarian stance, making her appear all the more buffoonish. "There's no denying that these shenanigans have turned Bushcrest Country Club upside-down and inside-out," club spokesperson Walthrop C. McBain said. "Why, these slobs strode right into the pool area as if they owned it. Shortly after entering the pool, McBain recounted, the slobs began splashing inappropriately and engaging in horseplay. When an on-duty lifeguard attempted to reassert control, the slobs gathered behind him and toppled his big chair right into the pool with a loud crash. "I find myself infuriated by such brazen cheek," McBain said. Despite their obviously crude exterior, the slobs seem to possess a strong sense of pride. "Just because we're not a bunch of stiff-lipped upper-crust snooties doesn't mean we can be pushed around," said Michael O'Keene, a part-time club caddy and self-described serious partier. "There was a time when I kissed up to these snobs in the hopes of receiving the club's special caddy scholarship. But in the end, I learned I had to be true to my heart. No matter how stuffy and authoritarian the setting, the snobs cannot keep us down. Though first believed to be an isolated event, yesterday's snob-slob showdown is actually not the only such incident to occur recently. According to police, similarly heated confrontations between slobs and snobs have been reported at summer camps, army training bases, homecoming float parades, college cafeterias and whitewater rafting races throughout the nation. "Our latest batch of crazy cadets is driving me positively loony with their incessant pranks! " said Commander Lassard of the Police Academy, just one of the nation's many organizations to experience a significant rise in zany shenanigans recently. "Those no-good bumbling morons will never get it together in time to graduate! …Or will they?

Teens Get Drunk On Award-Winning Microbrew
EAST BRUNSWICK, NJ — The subtle interplay of the three varietal hops in MacTadcaster's Nut Brown Stout went tragically unappreciated Saturday when a group of high-school students got shitfaced on a case of the award-winning microbrew. According to reports, Jared Rosenthal, Andrew Gobbola and Tracey Sheehan, 17-year-old seniors at East Brunswick High, obtained the beer from Rosenthal's refrigerator while his parents — bona-fide beer-lovers capable of fully relishing the subtle, hand-crafted taste of a MacTadcaster's — were away for the weekend. Though none of the teens were able to comment on the Nut Brown Stout's chocolatey aroma or its surprisingly smoky almond finish, Rosenthal did say that it had "fucked him up majorly" and that he was "seriously payin' the price. Added Gobbola: "Dude, I was ripped to the tits. Despite consuming enormous quantities of the beer, the teens failed to detect the all-wheat malt that MacTadcaster's has developed over the years to give its beer "bottom." Further, none of them commented on the beer's uniquely dry, smoky hopping or the pleasant coffee highlights so often discussed among MacTadcaster's Nut Brown Stout cognoscenti. Only the rich, robust texture of the beer drew any comment from the teens, with Sheehan overheard telling Rosenthal, "That beer is some thick shit. MacTadcaster's Nut Brown Stout has won the Gold Medal for Best Small Batch Stout for three consecutive years at the Great American Beer Festival. John Winbourne, Chief Brewmaster at MacTadcaster's, said he was "shocked and disappointed" that the high-quality beer had wound up in the hands of unsophisticated, high school-age drinkers. "Nobody the age of 17 can reasonably be expected to have the connoisseurship to detect even a fraction of the subtle complexities of our carefully aged stout," Winbourne said. "If they had guzzled our Honey Hefeweizen, a much simpler beer known for its plain, rumpled friendliness, the horror may have been muted somewhat. "It's a tragedy, a real tragedy," said Steve Brauner, editor of Beer Aficionado magazine. "We're not talking about Bud Ice or Coors Light, or some mass-produced swill of a lager intended for crass high-school kids to get a cheap buzz off of. This is a complex, mature stout, whose creamy head alone is enough to overwhelm even the most experienced beer drinker. "I can only hope those kids didn't drink it chilled," Brauner added. "Stouts are best enjoyed at room temperature. According to sources within East Brunswick High School, the trio has previously been seen at night near the school's football field, drinking inexpensive domestic beers. "While such experimentation with alcohol is strongly discouraged," school principal Eileen Fleischer said, "at least these previous incidents only involved the three students getting wasted, as opposed to this senseless wasting of hand-crafted, award-winning beer. Helmut Schildkraut is the experienced Bavarian farmer who harvested the hops in the MacTadcaster's twelve-pack at the peak of their mellow ripeness, then aged them in a oaken sherry cask for three months to maximally enhance their dignified flavor. Contacted at his home in the tiny German village of Gütbourg, he said: "Zis makes me very sad. Nein, der MacTadcaster's ist not fur der kinder. Ist fur der discriminating bier drinker only.

Area Stoners Mistakenly Hold Massive Kemp Rally
BOULDER, CO — A diverse group of marijuana advocates, or "stoners" as they are popularly known, mistakenly held a massive rally in support of Republican party vice-presidential nominee Jack Kemp yesterday, calling upon citizens and the legislature in their demands for the candidate's immediate legalization. Touting Kemp as "America's unsung miracle crop," the group announced that the one-time NFL quarterback and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development could revolutionize American agriculture, creating an amazing new source of cheap and renewable raw material for everything from medical supplies to textile and paper fiber to dietary protein. "Everybody thinks Kemp is un-American, but George Washington himself grew Kemp," rally organizer Heather "Rain" Sanders said. "And he was, like, the father of our country. " According to Sanders, Kemp was also grown by Thomas Jefferson, whom she claimed today would be imprisoned for planting, raising and harvesting the longtime Congressional conservative. In addition to carrying banners and shouting slogans of protest, the tie-dyed, long-haired demonstrators publicly flaunted their pro-Kemp stance by openly smoking "joints," a slang term for cigarettes rolled with marijuana, a substance which, according to ralliers, is derived from a seedless, female variety of the vice-presidential nominee. Rally attendee Mike Cudahy concurred with the many pro-Kemp claims, holding up a wool hat emblazoned with a design reading, "Cypress Hill: Insane In The Membrane," and telling reporters, "This hat is 100 percent Kemp!" "Jack Kemp remains the nation's best source of cheap, non-polluting paper and cloth," rallygoer Frank "Thatches" Moynihan said. "In the early 20th century, he was also used to make high-quality rope until his unethical criminalization in 1932, which was railroaded through Congress via a yellow journalism smear campaign by William Randolph Hearst." Added Moynihan: "Man, am I baked. Despite running smoothly overall, the Kemp rally was briefly interrupted by Republican campaign advocates who showed up in support of their candidate. In addition to angering the crowd by refusing to wear marijuana leaf buttons handed out by rally organizers, the Republicans frightened many in attendance with their conservative, monochromatic mode of dress. "I'm standin' there yellin', 'Kemp! Kemp!' and this suit-wearin tie guy is standin' right next to me. I'm like, 'What the hell?' " said protester Jamie "Starbaby" Dugan, of nearby Ft. Collins. "I don't know who those guys were, but they sure didn't look like Kemp smokers to me. Maybe they were narcs. The rally was also briefly interrupted by local police officials, who attempted to explain to ralliers their fundamental hemp/Kemp confusion. Despite their efforts, the officials were quickly drowned out by protesters who chanted, "We won't listen to your lies! Kemp will make this nation high! " over and over until collapsing in coughing spasms. They continued to chant and make speeches until reconvening several hours later to enjoy unlimited salad bar visits at a nearby Wendy's. While the vice-presidential candidate himself did not attend the demonstration, Kemp's office issued a formal response: "This demonstration and others like it prove that America wants Kemp. Only the team of Kemp and Dole can make the United States great again! Despite expressing pleasure with the rally, the statement did, however, strongly deny that Kemp is a plant. "We can assure you and your readers that the Congressman is decidedly mammalian in taxonomy," it read. "Mr. Kemp is now and has always been staunchly non-fibrous."

Lovable Cockney Charms Neighbors
CLOTTS, IN — The residents of Clotts have been getting quite an education in foreign cultures since the recent arrival of immigrant Nigel Edney, a real live Cockney from London, England. And with a colorful accent and a nimble wit to match, this tenacious teabag is fast capturing the hearts of his new neighbors. "'Elp, 'elp, me 'ouse is on fire! " Edney told the neighbors and members of the news media who had gathered to watch the plucky little gent in his latest misadventure. "I think it started in the gare-age! Please, ring up the fire brigade, me wife and baby grandchild are in 'ere!" The native population of England, called the "British," are diverse in class and income, but the most lovable of all is the Cockney, a lower-class Londoner. Known as a drinker and carouser, and frequently out of work, the Cockney greets the world with a smile and a saucy wink, for he knows that life is but an elaborate charade. That irreverent yet exuberant attitude came into play as Edney ran about on his stout little legs and waved his stumpy arms frantically. "Oh, God 'elp me! " Edney shouted to his neighbors, who couldn't help but chuckle at Edney's beet-red expression. "Edna and the li'l lad is in 'at 'ouse! For the love of God, I'm begging you! 'Ey're goin' t'die in 'ere if somebody don't come 'elp!" "He's just so cute! " said Harriet Gustafson, one of many charmed neighbors. "He has a little ruddy face and wears his little tweed cap cocked to one side. Just like Andy Capp!" Not surprisingly, Edney's newfound American friends sometimes have a bit of trouble understanding just what the funny fellow is saying. Just last week, Edney complained to his landlord that the "telly" that came with his "bed-sit" sometimes shot off "sparks" and at one point caused his "drapes" to "smolder." "I still can't figure out what he meant," shrugged Delmore Properties president Jim Delmore. "He just talks so crazy! But even if he doesn't always make himself understood, Edney's hardly one to let that stop him: "'Ere, give us a 'and with this 'ose! No, the 'ose, the 'ose! Oh, dear God, the smoke is just too thick! Oh, poor Edna! And li'l Timmy! 'Elp! Fire! For the love of God — firemen, please 'urry!" "Look at him," neighbor Nancy Marcus cooed. "With his face all covered in soot and ash, he looks just like one of those chimneysweeps from Mary Poppins!" But, as always, Edney is ever ready with a snappy answer. "'Elp! 'Urry! You sodding, rotten, bloody, uncaring bastards! Rot, I say! Rot in 'ell, the whole bloody stinkin' lot of you!

Second-Grader Expelled From Sex Farm
WINSLOW, OK — Controversy erupted Monday at an area sex farm/white slavery compound when second-grader Tim Hildemen was expelled for refusing to felch a llama. "This kind of inhibited behavior is totally inappropriate for our sex farm," sex farm commandant Henry Prathers said. The felching incident was to be part of a group-sex video produced by the compound leaders. Hildemen, 7, will be blindfolded, then driven in the sex-farm van to an undisclosed locale and pushed out. Summing up the reaction of an outraged community, mother Ellen Mayes said: "What kind of message does Tim's behavior send to other kids?

Area Panties In A Bunch
CROSS PLAINS, GA — According to police, a pair of area panties was discovered yesterday all wound up in a bunch and badly in need of some loosening. "Whoever owned these panties," Cross Plains Police Chief Jonathan Norcross said, "obviously needed to relax. Failure to chill out is the number one reason so many panties get bunched in this country each year. " Though the panties investigation is still pending, Norcross denied rumors of a connection between yesterday's incident and a pair of Atlanta-area undies discovered last Sunday in a bundle.

Inner-City Stabbings Leave Five Maidless
CHICAGO — A string of inner-city stabbings left five residents of Chicago's wealthy Highland Park suburb maidless this weekend. According to police, the crimes seem to be related, in that all five residents were left without kitchen and dining room service for their morning meal. "It was horrible," said Highland Park resident Edmund O. Rayburn. "We were left with no choice but to perform such tasks as making the bed, running cold water from the tap, and pulling out chairs for ourselves before sitting on them. The Chicago Police Department is conducting a full-scale investigation of the interruption in maid service, and plans to issue a formal report to the Highland Park Gate and Security Service by the end of this week. "We're doing everything we can to find the perpetrator," Police Chief Stan Jacoby said. "And we're urging everyone on Chicago's streets to be wary. We don't want any gardeners to disappear. There's been enough suffering. According to reports, the Highland Park residents' agonizing maidlessness lasted over 12 hours, ending only when a Chicago-area domestic temp agency airlifted in emergency replacement maids, free of charge. "It was the least we could do," said Marcy Peters, assistant manager of Maid Just For You! "Nobody should ever have to go maidless. Ever." Victims reported feeling confused and vulnerable, sometimes even frightened, during the hours in which they were maidless. "The doorbell rang and we didn't really know how to react," Lillian Worthington, 58, said. "We just sat at the table looking at each other until it stopped. Fortunately for Worthington, the maid was the only member of her staff to be stabbed repeatedly in the throat, allowing services such as cooking and car-washing to continue unaffected. "The wet towels in the bathroom didn't get replaced until after noon, and my newspaper wasn't even ironed," said victim Peter Devlinger. "Georgette's murder couldn't have been more inconvenient. The Devlinger household was further disrupted when the deceased maid's daughter arrived to pick up her mother's belongings. "She came in, sobbing hysterically, and I didn't know what to do," Devlinger said. "Normally, that's just the type of thing that Georgette would handle. For several of the residents, simply not knowing if their maid was all right was the hardest part. "I spent a lot of time on Sunday tracking my maid down," said Edwina Haversham, head of the Haversham Insurance Trust Ladies' Board. "I had to find out her name, and then I had to get her phone number from one of the other help, and then I actually had to speak with her family. It was a horrible, exhausting bother, and for what? Just to find out that she'd been killed, and I had to hire a new girl anyway. Bernetta Voorhees, vice president of ChicagoCom, a local telecommunications corporation, located her maid Sunday morning in an unresponsive critical state in a Chicago hospital.

Loveless Union Ends In Baby
ROCKFORD, IL — A loveless union resulted Monday in the birth of a baby who, according to area love experts, will almost certainly never receive the warm, nurturing love it needs to develop fully. Nor, they say, will it ever learn to show love for others in its lifetime. The child, William Thurnbloch, Jr., was conceived in the hopes that its presence might function as a love substitute in the lives of its parents, William and Suzanne Thurnbloch, of Rockford. Sources agree this attempt is doomed to failure, and that the Thurnblochs will continue to live lives as devoid of love as ever before. "I doubt either Bill or Suzanne ever fully comprehended what love was, and, therefore, never realized that their lives lacked love," Department of Love and Related Issues regional chairperson and psychotherapist Kent McNuhm said. "Nonetheless, a subconscious perception of the inherent emptiness of their lives drove them to reproduce." McNuhm went on to cite the couple's total lack of interest in each other's daily lives, refusal to engage in conversation, and constant, ill-fated extra-marital dalliances as factors marking the union as loveless. Married four years ago as a response to family pressure, as well as to stave off a deep-seated fear of solitude, the Thurnblochs lack even the most basic psychological characteristics required to raise an emotionally healthy child. It is virtually certain their baby will grow up to mirror their staggeringly bleak worldview, raised in silent agony in a world it rightly perceives as cold and uncaring. Though acquaintances of the Thurnblochs report Suzanne has never been happier than she is while cuddling her new baby, experts firmly believe this feeling is meaningless and transient, signifying no real change or growth. "The baby is at this point unable to distinguish between itself and the rest of the world, including its mother," McNuhm said. "Suzanne is only capable of relating to the baby because it has no real personality of its own, serving as a narcissistic projection of herself." "Once the baby develops ego boundaries and becomes a distinct individual, she will complain constantly about it, tormenting it unceasingly with verbal and non-verbal cruelty, eventually withdrawing into apathy and neglect, and focusing her affections on some other identity-less entity, like a puppy or a character on TV," he added. Though the Thurnblochs engaged in successful sexual penetration for several months prior to conception, since the initial impregnation they have reverted to their usual states of sexual behavior: furtive masturbation, coupled with misogynistic fantasies in William Sr.'s case, and frigidity in Suzanne's. Experts say not only will William Jr. be unloved throughout childhood, he will also be unable to perceive love if and when it is ever offered him. "Little William," McNuhm concluded, "will be incapable of relating to the outside world, unable to differentiate between, say, petting a neighbor's dog and poking at its eyes with a spork." The couple plans to send him to military school once he learns to speak.

White Church Protected From Fire by God
Johnson City, AL — The Our Father of The Lord Christ in Heaven congregation was informed by God Sunday that no damage will come to its church, as it is the recipient of divine fire protection. Though every other neighborhood church has been attacked by torch-wielding vandals and burned to the ground, the all-white congregation will receive protection because, according to God, "You whites are made in my image and I shall not harm you." Though members had long speculated their God was a white man, aged between 55-70, they were relieved to finally receive hard proof of His whiteness. "It's not like we ever doubted it or anything," Pastor Conrad Thamfield told reporters. "If you think about it, it just makes sense that He is white. What else would He be?"

Middle Management Prepares for 'Operation Xerox-Fax'
HARTFORD, CT — Middle management officials at Coopers & Schmidt, a Hartford-based insurance claims adjustment firm, are busy gearing up this week for Operation Xerox-Fax, a covert, high-stakes faxing mission scheduled for April 23. The goal of the risky operation, which will involve an estimated three mid-level employees, ranging from assistant account coordinators to re-gional sales supervisors, is the successful photocopying, faxing and confirmation of Coopers & Schmidt's March '96 benefits summary. "This is an exciting, high-risk mission," said Tom Gerosa, an associate claims adjuster who has been with the firm for 14 years. "I pray no one is hurt." Operation Xerox-Fax is set to begin at 10 a.m. sharp, when Coopers & Schmidt secretary Janice D'Alessio will make a photocopy of the benefits summary, which she will then put in company vice-president Ralph Gleick's mailbox. When her portion of the mission is complete, D'Alessio will remove the original document from the Xerox machine, walk across the office, and hand-deliver it to regional benefits co-supervisor Art Blaine, who will be awaiting the document in his cubicle. Blaine is considered by many to be the pointman of the Operation. Responsible for double-checking the benefits summary against the benefits file on his computer, he must then transport it safely to new accounts manager Terri Auletta at the fax machine, which lies more than 30 yards from Blaine's cubicle, past the supply closet, paper shredder and inspirational corporate poster that reads: "Success — If You Believe It, You Can Achieve It." "There will be dangers, no doubt," said Blaine, who was promoted from assistant benefits supervisor to co-supervisor six years ago when Ted Stram died. "The area of the office I will cross is one of our most volatile — sales managers demonstrating golf swings, outgoing Federal Express packages lying on the floor, the list goes on. My wife is very concerned, but she knows this is what comes along with the job. She knew it wouldn't be easy when she married me. She's strong though." Making matters more tense is the fact that the fax can only take place between 10:45 and 11:30 a.m. If the fax doesn't get sent during that window, then the recipient, regional assistant sales and benefits manager Gary Tre-mont, will in all likelihood be at lunch, meaning the fax cannot get sent and have receipt confirmed until after the lunch hour, which could be as late as 2 p.m. "I don't even want to talk about that possibility," Au-letta said. "Fail-ure is not an option with this team." Operation coordinator Paul McHue is confident his elite squad of middle management employees is fully prepared for its mission. "We have trained day and night for months for this Operation," McHue said. "The photocopy machine's ink cartridge has been checked and re-checked. Missing staplers have either been returned or replaced. Paper clips have been positioned at strategic points along the mission route. Fax numbers have been confirmed. Hallways have been cleared of all empty boxes. Clearance has been received from office manager Nancy Lu-ber-da. We only get one shot at this." Despite all the preparations, disaster almost struck Thursday when, during a rou-tine test run, the Xerox ma-chine un-expect-edly ran out of paper. "We were out of letter-size, and had no choice but to go with bright pink legal-size pa-per," Auletta said. "Had that happened during the real thing, all would have been lost." The man responsible for the empty paper tray, assistant claims adjuster George Haselbreit, has since been replaced. "George was always too much of a risk," McHue said. "His style was too flashy; he was too much of a hot dog, a loose cannon. We had no choice but to replace him with someone who can stick to a mission directive — Pat Cook from third-floor client services." Operation Xerox-Fax, which was approved last Thursday in a hand-signed memo from Lu-ber-da, is the boldest fax-related maneuver undertaken at Coopers & Schmidt in nearly four years. In November 1992, a renegade team of seventh-floor actuaries and accountants faxed client Jim Reinhardt, a Hartford physician, a four-page spreadsheet analysis of his projected taxable earnings from holdings and investments for fiscal year 1993. "Three of us went into the office that day," recalled accountant William Keating, who was part of Operation Fax Spreadsheet Data to Jim Rein-hardt. "And only two came out." The third member, actuary Harlan Stone, left the office that day shortly after lunch with a cold. If Operation Xerox-Fax is a success, all three team members can anticipate a well-deserved vacation soon after its completion. "Patriot's Day is coming up," Auletta said. "You better believe I'm going to make the most of the half-day we get off."

Crips Streamline Membership Application Process
Paperwork, Beatings To Be Reduced 50% LOS ANGELES — In an effort to better serve potential new members, the L.A.-based Crips street gang unveiled a revamped gang application procedure yesterday, one expected to reduce both initiation beatings and paperwork by 50 percent. The new process, which was principally designed by Crips president LaShawn Harris, is scheduled to take effect immediately. "We are confident that the changes will make becoming a Crip easier and more enjoyable," Harris said. "We simply felt that the old procedure, which involved filling out long, detailed application forms in triplicate; getting the forms stamped by a notary public; and having senior gang members urinate in one's mouth, was discouraging to many young people interested in being a part of our organization." Among the major changes: New members will no longer be required to show ID before selecting a ho from the Crips' stable of bitches. "In the past, anyone with less than two years' membership had to have an active ID card with an up-to-date sticker on the back if they wanted to get freaky with one of the hoes," Crips treasurer Trezelle Ivey said. "Now, all they have to do is give their membership number and initial a sheet." Ivey added that when knocking boots, gang members now have the added option of using a special new voucher, which can be re-credited to one's account if the bitch turns cold and refuses to give it up. Another improvement the Crips have made is greater flexibility in scheduling initiation murders. "Until now, we pretty much told new members that they would have to go out and kill a Blood at a time that was good for us," Crips vice-president Dwayne Henderson said. "Well, very often that made things difficult for those who had a prior commitment, such as a job or internship. Now, new members can commit their mandatory killings at a time that's good for them, not us." The Crips have also revamped their branding procedure. "No longer will new members be forcibly held down by four senior Crips as a giant 'C' is burned into their back," Henderson said. "We now offer frightened new members the option of having a fifth person help restrain them." To offset the cost of providing the fifth helper at brandings, however, the gang will no longer offer initiates a free blunt or 40-ounce of St. Ides to numb the pain. So far, reaction to the changes have been largely positive. "When my older brother joined the Crips in 1991, he had to wait in line for hours," new member Keyshon Williams, 14, said. "But when I joined recently, there was practically no wait at all. I was initiated and beaten in less than 15 minutes. And I was actually doing drive-bys the very next day." LAPD officials are impressed by the changes. "With so many young people today interested in gangbanging, it's often difficult for popular gangs to process them fast enough," Sgt. Jeff Herron said. "But the Crips are doing a tremendous job accommodating all these kids. And their processing center is now open until 8 p.m. on Thursdays, which helps a lot for those with nine-to-five jobs." According to Crip spokesperson Allan "T. Boz" Watkins, by 1998 the gang hopes to have all members' records computerized. "At the push of a button, we'll know exactly who's killed whom, and who has said what about whose mother." Despite the application procedure changes, the gang's resignation procedure will remain the same. According to Harris: "Those looking to quit will still have to complete resignation forms in duplicate, fill out the Crips exit survey, undergo an exit interview to let management know personally how they felt about their experience with us, and hand in all registered sawed-offs and glocks."

Professor Deeply Hurt by Student's Evaluation
Leon Rothberg, Ph.D., a 58-year-old professor of English Literature at Ohio State University, was shocked and saddened Monday after receiving a sub-par mid-semester evaluation from freshman student Chad Berner. The circles labeled 4 and 5 on the Scan-Tron form were predominantly filled in, placing Rothberg's teaching skill in the "below average" to "poor" range. Although the evaluation has deeply hurt Rothberg's feelings, Berner defended his judgment at a press conference yesterday. "That class is totally boring," said Berner, one of 342 students in Rothberg's introductory English 161 class. "When I go, I have to read the school paper to keep from falling asleep. One of my brothers does a comic strip called 'The Booze Brothers.' It's awesome." The poor rating has left Rothberg, a Rhodes Scholar, distraught and doubting his ability to teach effectively at the university level. "Maybe I'm just no good at this job," said Rothberg, recipient of the 1993 Jean-Foucault Lacan award from the University of Chicago for his paper on public/private feminist deconstructive discourse in the early narratives of Catherine of Siena. "Chad's right. I am totally boring." In the wake of the evaluation, Rothberg is considering canceling his fall sabbatical to the University of Geneva, where he is slated to serve as a Henri Bynum-Derridas Visiting Scholar. Instead, Rothberg may take a rudimentary public speaking course as well as offer his services to students like Berner, should they desire personal tutoring. "The needs of my first-year students come well before any prestigious personal awards offered to me by international academic assemblies," Rothberg said. "After all, I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of knowledge, and to imparting it to those who are coming after me. I know that's why these students are here, so I owe it to them." Though Rothberg, noted author of The Violent Body: Marxist Roots of Postmodern Homoerotic Mysticism and the Feminine Form in St. Augustine's Confessions, has attempted to contact Berner numerous times by telephone, Berner has not returned his calls, leading Rothberg to believe that Berner is serious in his condemnation of the professor. "I'm always stoned when he calls, so I let the answering machine pick it up," said Berner, who maintains a steady 2.3 GPA. "My roommate just got this new bong that totally kicks ass. We call it Sky Lab." Those close to Rothberg agree that the negative evaluation is difficult to overcome. "Richard is trying to keep a stiff upper lip around his colleagues, but I know he's taking it very hard," said Susan Feinstein-Rothberg, a fellow English professor and Rothberg's wife of 29 years. "He knows that students like Chad deserve better." When told of Rothberg's thoughts of quitting, Berner became angry. "He'd better finish up the class," Berner said. "I need those three humanities credits to be eligible to apply to the business school next year." The English Department administration at Ohio State is taking a hard look at Rothberg's performance in the wake of Berner's poor evaluation. "Students and the enormous revenue they bring in to our institution are a more valued commodity to us than faculty," Dean James Hewitt said. "Although Rothberg is a distinguished, tenured professor with countless academic credentials and knowledge of 21 modern and ancient languages, there is absolutely no excuse for his boring Chad with his lectures. Chad must be entertained at all costs."

World's Longest Wall Completed
'No one has ever built a wall this great,' mayor says PEMBROKE, IL — The Bernstein-Grey construction company announced the completion of the world's longest wall yesterday, putting the final touches on the single greatest feat in U.S. architectural history. The Big Wall of Pembroke, a joint effort between the town's beautification committee and the board of tourism, measures a full 23 1/3 feet long by 11 2/3 feet tall by 36 inches thick. Its construction began in December 1995 and ended yesterday amid great fanfare and excitement. "No one has built a wall of this size and scope in the history of the world," said Bernstein/Grey president Arthur Bernstein, who personally oversaw a project that was largely scorned by the U.S. architectural community. "I challenge anyone to even attempt such a grand wall." As all 2,300 residents of Pembroke gathered at the wall's base for a ceremonial ribbon-cutting, Mayor Arty Leucking addressed the crowd. "We are very, very pleased with the wall," Leucking said. "There were plenty of naysayers in this community, people who doubted its feasibility. But their protests are forever silenced now that the finished wall has been unveiled. It is indeed a mighty, even 'great' wall." Added Pembroke alder Kate Dermot: "The wall is huge. If there is a wall this large anywhere else, I've never seen it, and I've been all over the tri-county area. It's even visible by helicopter, provided you don't go too high." From the outset, the Big Wall had the trappings of an engineering impossibility. Architects the world over were consulted, but all but one turned down the project for undisclosed reasons. The job was eventually accepted by Bernstein-Grey, a prestigious firm based in nearby Grainger, IN. The firm submitted and saw rejected nearly two dozen designs before a final plan was agreed upon. "We were very nervous about the scale of the wall, its sheer enormity," architect Ken Millin said. "Consequently, we were overly cautious in our design. We submitted plans for a 15-foot wall made of plastic, a 19-foot wall made of ceramic-covered aluminum, and a 20-foot wall made of a uranium shell with a liquid mercury-based ore center. They were all turned down because they were too small." The final design employs a series of interlocking blocks of fired clay stacked atop one another and covered with an experimental plaster substitute. "That design we knew was a keeper," Millin said. "It combines architectural dynamics the world has never seen — something that is going to last 10, maybe 20 years of harsh southern Illinois winters." Despite the overwhelming excitement surrounding the wall, its construction was not without problems. In January, a strong wind destroyed two-thirds of the structure. Although there were no injuries, a full eight feet of the wall had to be rebuilt. Further tragedy marred the wall in early March, when construction worker Bart Meadows, who was working at the top, fell off his ladder. He suffered a bruise to his shoulder and scraped his knee on a pebble. "It hurt a lot," Meadows said. "I had to go get a Band-Aid, and for the next week, every time I lifted my arm it was kinda sore." Even when the Big Wall was proposed, a dream of a small but dedicated group of boosters, opposition within the community nearly derailed it. "It wasn't that they couldn't see the necessity for the wall," Dermot said. "It's just that a project of this magnitude had never been conceived before. A wall this large? Impossible!" The Big Wall has spawned a number of businesses selling memorabilia, including T-shirts with slogans such as, "You saw a bigger wall where?" and "I went to the Big Wall of Pembroke and here's a T-shirt that proves it." Now that the wall is complete, plans will commence for new, four-sided hollow structures for human habitation, allowing Pembroke residents to leave their dank cave dwellings. Said Leucking: "The only glitch is that the proposed structures have a propensity for letting in rain. Once we solve that, we will be able to live in comfort and ease until our God comes down and takes us home."

Uptight Matron Enjoys Handful of Pills
SCOTSDALE, AZ — Georgette McHue, a Scotsdale-area uptight matron, enjoyed a handful of colorful pills yesterday, swallowing them down after dinner with a glass of water. The estimated 39 gel-capped pills, an assortment of doctor-prescribed medications designed to fortify her diet and calm a recently diagnosed nervous condition, were described by McHue as "very important" to her continued good health. "I feel more spring in my step than when I was in my 20s," she said. She is slated to take the same dosage every day at dinner time until prescribed otherwise. "The blue one is for calcium, the orange one is for fiber, the pink one is estrogen, the big yellow one is for shingles, and the white ones help me sleep better," McHue explained.
